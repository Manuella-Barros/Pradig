(AP) -- At least 973 Native American children died in the U.S. government's abusive boarding school system, according to the results of an investigation released Tuesday by officials who called on the government to apologize for the schools.\n\nThe investigation commissioned by Interior Sec. Deb Haaland found marked and unmarked graves at 65 of the more than 400 U.S. boarding schools that were established to forcibly assimilate Native American children into white society. The findings don't specify how each child died, but the causes of death included sickness, accidents and abuse during a 150-year period that ended in 1969, officials said.\n\nThe findings follow a series of listening sessions across the U.S. over the past two years in which dozens of former students recounted the harsh and often degrading treatment they endured while separated from their families.\n\n\"The federal government -- facilitated by the Department I lead -- took deliberate and strategic actions through federal Indian boarding school policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures and connections that are foundational to Native people,\" Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe in New Mexico and the country's first Native American Cabinet secretary, said in a news release Tuesday.\n\nIn an initial report released in 2022, officials estimated that more than 500 children died at the schools. The federal government passed laws and policies in 1819 to support the schools, the last of which were still operating in the 1960s.\n\nThe schools gave Native American kids English names, put them through military drills and forced them to perform manual labor, such as farming, brick-making and working on the railroad, officials said.\n\nFormer students shared tearful recollections of their experience during listening sessions in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Michigan, Arizona, Alaska and other states. They talked about being punished for speaking their native language, getting locked in basements, and having their hair cut to stamp out their identities. They were sometimes subjected to solitary confinement, beatings and the withholding of food. Many left the schools with only basic vocational skills that gave them few job prospects.\n\nDonovan Archambault, 85, of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana, said he was sent away to boarding schools beginning at age 11 and was mistreated, forced to cut his hair and prevented from speaking his native language. He said he drank heavily before turning his life around more than two decades later, and never discussed his school days with his children until he wrote a book about the experience several years ago.\n\n\"An apology is needed. They should apologize,\" Archambault told The Associated Press by phone Tuesday. \"But there also needs to be a broader education about what happened to us. To me, it's part of a forgotten history.\"\n\nThe new report doesn't specify who should issue the apology on behalf of the federal government, saying only that it should be issued through \"appropriate means and officials to demonstrate that it is made on behalf of the people of the United States and be accompanied by bold and actionable policies.\"\n\nInterior Department officials also recommended that the government invest in programs that could help Native American communities heal from the traumas caused by boarding schools. That includes money for education, violence prevention and the revitalization of indigenous languages. Spending on those efforts should be on a scale proportional to the $23 billion in inflation adjusted spending on the schools, agency officials said.\n\nThe schools, similar institutions and related assimilation programs were funded by $23.3 billion in inflation-adjusted federal spending, officials determined. Religious and private institutions that ran many of the institutions received federal money as partners in the campaign to \"civilize\" Indigenous students, according to the new report.\n\nBy 1926, more than 80% of Indigenous school-age children -- some 60,000 children -- were attending boarding schools that were run either by the federal government or religious organizations, according to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.\n\nThe Minnesota-based group has tallied more than 100 additional schools not on the government list that were run by churches and with no evidence of federal support.\n\nU.S. Catholic bishops in June apologized for the church's role in trauma the children experienced. And in 2022, Pope Francis apologized for the Catholic Church's cooperation with boarding schools in Canada. He said the forced assimilation of Native peoples into Christian society destroyed their cultures, severed families and marginalized generations.\n\nLegislation pending before Congress would establish a \"Truth and Healing Commission\" to document and acknowledge past injustices related to boarding schools. The measure is sponsored in the Senate by Democrat Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and backed by Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\n\n\"It is time the federal government takes responsibility for its harmful policies,\" Murkowski said on the Senate floor last week. \"Our Commission will provide a Native-led process for communities to share the stories, share the truth, and pursue healing.\"",

Federal officials with the Interior Department called on the U.S. government Tuesday, July 30, 2024, to apologize for a nationwide system of boarding schools in which Native children faced abuse and neglect.\n\nBILLINGS, Mont. (AP) -- At least 973 Native American children died in the U.S. government's abusive boarding school system, according to the results of an investigation released Tuesday by officials who called on the government to apologize for the schools.\n\nThe investigation commissioned by Interior Sec. Deb Haaland found marked and unmarked graves at 65 of the more than 400 U.S. boarding schools that were established to forcibly assimilate Native American children into white society. The findings don't specify how each child died, but the causes of death included sickness, accidents and abuse during a 150-year period that ended in 1969, officials said.\n\nThe findings follow a series of listening sessions across the U.S. over the past two years in which dozens of former students recounted the harsh and often degrading treatment they endured while separated from their families.\n\n\"The federal government -- facilitated by the Department I lead -- took deliberate and strategic actions through federal Indian boarding school policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures and connections that are foundational to Native people,\" Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe in New Mexico and the country's first Native American Cabinet secretary, said in a news release Tuesday.\n\nIn an initial report released in 2022, officials estimated that more than 500 children died at the schools. The federal government passed laws and policies in 1819 to support the schools, the last of which were still operating in the 1960s.\n\nThe schools gave Native American kids English names, put them through military drills and forced them to perform manual labor, such as farming, brick-making and working on the railroad, officials said.\n\nFormer students shared tearful recollections of their experience during listening sessions in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Michigan, Arizona, Alaska and other states. They talked about being punished for speaking their native language, getting locked in basements, and having their hair cut to stamp out their identities. They were sometimes subjected to solitary confinement, beatings and the withholding of food. Many left the schools with only basic vocational skills that gave them few job prospects.\n\nDonovan Archambault, 85, of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana, said he was sent away to boarding schools beginning at age 11 and was mistreated, forced to cut his hair and prevented from speaking his native language. He said he drank heavily before turning his life around more than two decades later, and never discussed his school days with his children until he wrote a book about the experience several years ago.\n\n\"An apology is needed. They should apologize,\" Archambault told The Associated Press by phone Tuesday. \"But there also needs to be a broader education about what happened to us. To me, it's part of a forgotten history.\"\n\nThe new report doesn't specify who should issue the apology on behalf of the federal government, saying only that it should be issued through \"appropriate means and officials to demonstrate that it is made on behalf of the people of the United States and be accompanied by bold and actionable policies.\"\n\nInterior Department officials also recommended that the government invest in programs that could help Native American communities heal from the traumas caused by boarding schools. That includes money for education, violence prevention and the revitalization of indigenous languages. Spending on those efforts should be on a scale proportional to the $23 billion in inflation adjusted spending on the schools, agency officials said.\n\nThe schools, similar institutions and related assimilation programs were funded by $23.3 billion in inflation-adjusted federal spending, officials determined. Religious and private institutions that ran many of the institutions received federal money as partners in the campaign to \"civilize\" Indigenous students, according to the new report.\n\nBy 1926, more than 80% of Indigenous school-age children -- some 60,000 children -- were attending boarding schools that were run either by the federal government or religious organizations, according to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.\n\nThe Minnesota-based group has tallied more than 100 additional schools not on the government list that were run by churches and with no evidence of federal support.\n\nU.S. Catholic bishops in June apologized for the church's role in trauma the children experienced. And in 2022, Pope Francis apologized for the Catholic Church's cooperation with boarding schools in Canada. He said the forced assimilation of Native peoples into Christian society destroyed their cultures, severed families and marginalized generations.\n\nLegislation pending before Congress would establish a \"Truth and Healing Commission\" to document and acknowledge past injustices related to boarding schools. The measure is sponsored in the Senate by Democrat Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and backed by Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\n\n\"It is time the federal government takes responsibility for its harmful policies,\" Murkowski said on the Senate floor last week. \"Our Commission will provide a Native-led process for communities to share the stories, share the truth, and pursue healing.\"",

The findings don't specify how each child died, but the causes of death included sickness, accidents and abuse during a 150-year period that ended in 1969, officials said.\n\nThe findings follow a series of listening sessions across the U.S. over the past two years in which dozens of former students recounted the harsh and often degrading treatment they endured while separated from their families.\n\n\"The federal government -- facilitated by the Department I lead -- took deliberate and strategic actions through federal Indian boarding school policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures and connections that are foundational to Native people,\" Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe in New Mexico and the country's first Native American Cabinet secretary, said in a news release Tuesday.\n\nIn an initial report released in 2022, officials estimated that more than 500 children died at the schools. The federal government passed laws and policies in 1819 to support the schools, the last of which were still operating in the 1960s.\n\nThe schools gave Native American kids English names, put them through military drills and forced them to perform manual labor, such as farming, brick-making and working on the railroad, officials said.\n\nFormer students shared tearful recollections of their experience during listening sessions in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Michigan, Arizona, Alaska and other states. They talked about being punished for speaking their native language, getting locked in basements, and having their hair cut to stamp out their identities. They were sometimes subjected to solitary confinement, beatings and the withholding of food. Many left the schools with only basic vocational skills that gave them few job prospects.\n\nDonovan Archambault, 85, of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana, said he was sent away to boarding schools beginning at age 11 and was mistreated, forced to cut his hair and prevented from speaking his native language. He said he drank heavily before turning his life around more than two decades later, and never discussed his school days with his children until he wrote a book about the experience several years ago.\n\n\"An apology is needed. They should apologize,\" Archambault told The Associated Press by phone Tuesday. \"But there also needs to be a broader education about what happened to us. To me, it's part of a forgotten history.\"\n\nThe new report doesn't specify who should issue the apology on behalf of the federal government, saying only that it should be issued through \"appropriate means and officials to demonstrate that it is made on behalf of the people of the United States and be accompanied by bold and actionable policies.\"\n\nInterior Department officials also recommended that the government invest in programs that could help Native American communities heal from the traumas caused by boarding schools. That includes money for education, violence prevention and the revitalization of indigenous languages. Spending on those efforts should be on a scale proportional to the $23 billion in inflation adjusted spending on the schools, agency officials said.\n\nThe schools, similar institutions and related assimilation programs were funded by more than $23 billion in inflation-adjusted federal spending, officials determined. Religious and private institutions that ran many of the institutions received federal money as partners in the campaign to \"civilize\" Indigenous students, according to the new report.\n\nBy 1926, more than 80% of Indigenous school-age children -- some 60,000 children -- were attending boarding schools that were run either by the federal government or religious organizations, according to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.\n\nThe Minnesota-based group has tallied more than 100 additional schools not on the government list that were run by churches and with no evidence of federal support.\n\nU.S. Catholic bishops in June apologized for the church's role in trauma the children experienced. And in 2022, Pope Francis apologized for the Catholic Church's cooperation with boarding schools in Canada. He said the forced assimilation of Native peoples into Christian society destroyed their cultures, severed families and marginalized generations.\n\nLegislation pending before Congress would establish a \"Truth and Healing Commission\" to document and acknowledge past injustices related to boarding schools. The measure is sponsored in the Senate by Democrat Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and backed by Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\n\n\"It is time the federal government takes responsibility for its harmful policies,\" Murkowski said on the Senate floor last week. \"Our Commission will provide a Native-led process for communities to share the stories, share the truth, and pursue healing.\"",

The findings don't specify how each child died, but the causes of death included sickness and abuse during a 150-year period that ended in 1969, officials said.\n\nAdditional children may have died after becoming sick at school and being sent home, officials said.\n\nThe findings follow a series of listening sessions held throughout the U.S. over the past two years in which dozens of former students recounted the harsh and often degrading treatment they endured while separated from their families.\n\n\"The federal government took deliberate and strategic action through boarding school policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures, and connections that are foundational to Native people,\" Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe in New Mexico and the country's first Native American Cabinet secretary, said in a Tuesday call with reporters.\n\n\"Make no mistake,\" she added, \"This was a concerted attempt to eradicate the quote, 'Indian problem,' to either assimilate or destroy native peoples all together.\"\n\nIn an initial report released in 2022, officials estimated that more than 500 children died at the schools. The federal government passed laws and policies in 1819 to support the schools, the last of which were still operating in the 1960s.\n\nThe schools gave Native American kids English names, put them through military drills and forced them to perform manual labor, such as farming, brick-making and working on the railroad, officials said.\n\nFormer students shared tearful recollections of their experience during listening sessions in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Michigan, Arizona, Alaska and other states. They talked about being punished for speaking their native language, getting locked in basements, and having their hair cut to stamp out their identities. They were sometimes subjected to solitary confinement, beatings and the withholding of food. Many left the schools with only basic vocational skills that gave them few job prospects.\n\nDonovan Archambault, 85, the former chairman of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana, said beginning at age 11 he was sent away to boarding schools where he was mistreated, forced to cut his hair and prevented from speaking his native language. He said the experience led him to drink alcohol heavily before he turned his life around more than two decades later. He never talked about his school days with his children until he wrote a book about the experience several years ago.\n\n\"An apology is needed. They should apologize,\" Archambault told The Associated Press by phone Tuesday. \"But there also needs to be a broader education about what happened to us. To me, it's part of a forgotten history.\"\n\nHaaland said she was personally \"sorry beyond words,\" but she suggested a formal apology should come from the federal government. She didn't say if she would push President Joe Biden to issue one.\n\nInterior Department officials also recommended that the government invest in programs that could help Native American communities heal from the traumas caused by boarding schools. That includes money for education, violence prevention and the revitalization of indigenous languages. Spending on those efforts should be on a scale proportional to spending on the schools, agency officials said.\n\nThe schools, similar institutions and related assimilation programs were funded by $23.3 billion in inflation-adjusted federal spending, officials determined. Religious and private institutions that ran many of the institutions received federal money as partners in the campaign to \"civilize\" Indigenous students, according to the new report.\n\nBy 1926, more than 80% of Indigenous school-age children -- some 60,000 children -- were attending boarding schools that were run either by the federal government or religious organizations, according to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.\n\nThe Minnesota-based group has tallied more than 100 additional schools not on the government list that were run by churches and with no evidence of federal support.\n\nU.S. Catholic bishops in June apologized for the church's role in trauma the children experienced. And in 2022, Pope Francis apologized for the Catholic Church's cooperation with boarding schools in Canada. He said the forced assimilation of Native peoples into Christian society destroyed their cultures, severed families and marginalized generations.\n\nLegislation pending before Congress would establish a \"Truth and Healing Commission\" to document and acknowledge past injustices related to boarding schools. The measure is sponsored in the Senate by Democrat Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and backed by Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.", "source": {"uri": "channel4000.com", "dataType": "news",

(AP) -- At least 973 Native American children died in the U.S. government's abusive boarding school system, according to the results of an investigation released Tuesday by Interior Department officials who called on the government to apologize for the schools.\n\nThe investigation commissioned by Interior Secretary Deb Haaland found marked and unmarked graves at 65 of the more than 400 U.S. boarding schools where Native American children were forcibly assimilated into white society. The findings don't specify how each child died, but officials said the causes of death included sickness and abuse during a 150-year period that ended in 1969.\n\nAdditional children may have died after becoming sick at school and being sent home, officials said.\n\nThe findings follow a series of listening sessions held by Haaland throughout the U.S. over the past two years in which dozens of former students recounted harmful and often degrading treatment they endured while separated from their families.\n\n\"The federal government took deliberate and strategic action through boarding school policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures, and connections that are foundational to Native people,\" Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe in New Mexico and the country's first Native American Cabinet secretary, said in a Tuesday call with reporters.\n\n\"Make no mistake,\" she added, \"This was a concerted attempt to eradicate the quote, 'Indian problem' -- to either assimilate or destroy native peoples altogether.\"\n\nIn their initial findings two yeas ago, officials had estimated that more than 500 children died at the schools. The federal government passed laws and policies in 1819 to support the schools, which were still operating in the 1960s.\n\nThe schools gave Native American kids English names, put them through military drills and forced them to perform manual labor, such as farming, brick-making and working on the railroad, officials said.\n\nFormer students shared tearful recollections of their experience during the listening sessions in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Michigan, Arizona, Alaska and other states. They talked about being punished for speaking their native language, getting locked in basements, and having their hair cut to stamp out their identities. They were sometimes subjected to solitary confinement, beatings and the withholding of food. Many left the schools with only basic vocational skills that gave them few job prospects.\n\nDonovan Archambault, 85, the former chairman of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana, said beginning at age 11 he was sent away to boarding schools where he was mistreated, forced to cut his hair and prevented from speaking his native language. He said the experience led him to drink alcohol heavily before he turned his life around more than two decades later. He never talked about his school days with his children until he wrote a book about the experience several years ago.\n\n\"An apology is needed. They should apologize,\" Archambault told The Associated Press by phone Tuesday. \"But there also needs to be a broader education about what happened to us. To me, it's part of a forgotten history.\"\n\nHaaland said she was personally \"sorry beyond words,\" but there should also be a formal apology from the federal government. She didn't say if she would push President Joe Biden to issue one.\n\nInterior Department officials also recommended that the government invest in programs that could help Native American communities heal from the traumas caused by boarding schools. That includes money for education, violence prevention and the revitalization of indigenous languages. Spending on those efforts should be on a scale proportional to spending on the schools, agency officials said.\n\nThe schools, similar institutions and related assimilation programs were funded by $23.3 billion in inflation-adjusted federal spending, officials determined. Religious and private institutions that ran many of the institutions received federal money as partners in the campaign to \"civilize\" Indigenous students, according to the new report.\n\nBy 1926, most Indigenous school-age children -- some 60,000 children -- were attending boarding schools that were run either by the federal government or religious organizations, according to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.\n\n\"These are stolen generations of children,\" said Deborah Parker, CEO for the Minnesota-based group. \"It's about time the federal government speak so honestly and candidly about the impact.\"\n\nHaaland said her own grandparents were \"stolen from their parents, culture and communities\" at 8 years old and forced to live in a Catholic boarding school until they were 13. Others who went to schools were as young as 4, she said.\n\nMore than 200 of the schools had a religious affiliation, federal officials said. The boarding school coalition has identified more than 100 additional schools not on the government list that were run by churches, with no evidence of federal support.\n\nU.S. Catholic bishops in June apologized for the church's role in trauma the children experienced. And in 2022, Pope Francis apologized for the Catholic Church's cooperation with boarding schools in Canada. He said the forced assimilation of Native peoples into Christian society destroyed their cultures, severed families and marginalized generations.\n\nLegislation pending before Congress would establish a \"Truth and Healing Commission\" to further document and acknowledge past injustices related to boarding schools.", "source": {"uri": "bangordailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangor

Federal officials with the Interior Department called on the U.S. government Tuesday, July 30, 2024, to apologize for a nationwide system of boarding schools in which Native children faced abuse and neglect.\n\nBy Matthew Brown, Associated Press\n\nTuesday, July 30, 2024 | 9:58 p.m.\n\nBILLINGS, Mont. -- At least 973 Native American children died in the U.S. government's abusive boarding school system, according to the results of an investigation released Tuesday by Interior Department officials who called on the government to apologize for the schools.\n\nThe investigation commissioned by Interior Secretary Deb Haaland found marked and unmarked graves at 65 of the more than 400 U.S. boarding schools where Native American children were forcibly assimilated into white society. The findings don't specify how each child died, but officials said the causes of death included disease and abuse during a 150-year period that ended in 1969.\n\nAdditional children may have died after becoming sick at school and being sent home, officials said.\n\nThe findings follow a series of listening sessions held by Haaland over the past two years in which dozens of former students recounted harmful and often degrading treatment they endured at the hands of teachers and administrators while separated from their families.\n\n\"The federal government took deliberate and strategic action through boarding school policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures, and connections that are foundational to Native people,\" Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe in New Mexico and the country's first Native American Cabinet secretary, said in a Tuesday call with reporters.\n\n\"Make no mistake,\" she added, \"This was a concerted attempt to eradicate the quote, 'Indian problem' -- to either assimilate or destroy native peoples altogether.\"\n\nIn their initial findings two yeas ago, officials had estimated more than 500 American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian children died at the schools. The federal government passed laws and policies in 1819 to support the schools, which were still operating in the 1960s.\n\nThe schools gave Native American kids English names, put them through military drills and forced them to perform manual labor, such as farming, brick-making and working on railroads, officials said.\n\nFormer students shared tearful recollections of their experience during the listening sessions in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Michigan, Arizona, Alaska and other states. They talked about being punished for speaking their native language, getting locked in basements, and having their hair cut to stamp out their identities. They were sometimes subjected to solitary confinement, beatings and the withholding of food. Many left the schools with only basic vocational skills that gave them few job prospects.\n\nDonovan Archambault, 85, the former chairman of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana, said beginning at age 11 he was sent away to boarding schools where he was mistreated, forced to cut his hair and prevented from speaking his native language. He said the experience led him to drink alcohol heavily before he turned his life around more than two decades later. He never talked about his school days with his children until he wrote a book about the experience several years ago.\n\n\"An apology is needed. They should apologize,\" Archambault told The Associated Press by phone Tuesday. \"But there also needs to be a broader education about what happened to us. To me, it's part of a forgotten history.\"\n\nHaaland said she was personally \"sorry beyond words,\" but there should also be a formal apology from the federal government. She didn't say if she would press President Joe Biden to issue one.\n\nInterior Department officials also recommended that the government invest in programs that could help Native American communities heal from the traumas caused by boarding schools. That includes money for education, violence prevention and the revitalization of indigenous languages -- on a scale commensurate with government spending on the schools, agency officials said.\n\nThe schools, similar institutions and related assimilation programs were funded by $23.3 billion in inflation-adjusted federal spending, officials determined. Religious and private institutions that ran many of the institutions received federal money as partners in the campaign to \"civilize\" Indigenous students, according to the new report.\n\nBy the 1920s, most Indigenous school-age children -- some 60,000 children -- were attending boarding schools that were run either by the federal government or religious organizations, according to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.\n\n\"These are stolen generations of children,\" said Deborah Parker, CEO for the Minnesota-based group. \"It's about time the federal government speak so honestly and candidly about the impact.\"\n\nHaaland said her own grandparents were \"stolen from their parents, culture and communities\" when they were 8 years old and forced to live in a Catholic boarding school until they were 13. Others who went to schools were as young as 4, she said.\n\nMore than 200 schools supported by the government had a religious affiliation, federal officials said. The boarding school coalition has identified more than 100 additional schools not on the government list that were run by churches, with no evidence of federal support.\n\nU.S. Catholic bishops in June apologized for the church's role in trauma the children experienced. And in 2022, Pope Francis apologized for the Catholic Church's cooperation with boarding schools in Canada. He said the forced assimilation of Native peoples into Christian society destroyed their cultures, severed families and marginalized generations.\n\nLegislation pending before Congress would establish a \"Truth and Healing Commission\" to further document past injustices related to boarding schools. The legislation would give the commission authority to subpoena people for evidence.\n\nBut Catholic bishops pushed back against giving that subpoena power in a letter to lawmakers last week. Members of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops wrote that the commission should \"avoid an adversarial posture\" since they are willing to cooperate.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com",

The officials, including Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, have called for a government apology for the atrocities committed in these schools.\n\nThe investigation, initiated by Haaland, uncovered marked and unmarked graves at 65 out of more than 400 U.S. boarding schools where Native American children were forcibly assimilated into white society. While the specific causes of each child's death were not detailed, the findings indicated that fatalities were due to various factors, including illness and abuse. This dark chapter in history spanned a 150-year period, coming to an end in 1969.\n\nditional children may have died after becoming sick at school and being sent home, officials said.\n\nHaaland conducted a series of listening sessions across the U.S. in the past two years, during which numerous former students shared their experiences of mistreatment and degradation while being kept away from their families.\n\n\"The federal government took deliberate and strategic action through boarding school policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures, and connections that are foundational to Native people,\" Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe in New Mexico and the country's first Native American Cabinet secretary, said in a Tuesday call with reporters.\n\n\"Make no mistake,\" she added, \"This was a concerted attempt to eradicate the quote, 'Indian problem' -- to either assimilate or destroy native peoples altogether.\"\n\nIn their initial findings two yeas ago, officials had estimated that more than 500 children died at the schools. The federal government passed laws and policies in 1819 to support the schools, which were still operating in the 1960s.\n\nThe schools gave Native American kids English names, put them through military drills and forced them to perform manual labor, such as farming, brick-making and working on the railroad, officials said.\n\nFormer students shared tearful recollections of their experience during the listening sessions in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Michigan, Arizona, Alaska and other states. They talked about being punished for speaking their native language, getting locked in basements, and having their hair cut to stamp out their identities. They were sometimes subjected to solitary confinement, beatings and the withholding of food. Many left the schools with only basic vocational skills that gave them few job prospects.\n\nDonovan Archambault, 85, the former chairman of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana, said beginning at age 11 he was sent away to boarding schools where he was mistreated, forced to cut his hair and prevented from speaking his native language. He said the experience led him to drink alcohol heavily before he turned his life around more than two decades later. He never talked about his school days with his children until he wrote a book about the experience several years ago.\n\n\"An apology is needed. They should apologize,\" Archambault told The Associated Press by phone Tuesday. \"But there also needs to be a broader education about what happened to us. To me, it's part of a forgotten history.\"\n\nHaaland said she was personally \"sorry beyond words,\" but there should also be a formal apology from the federal government. She didn't say if she would push President Joe Biden to issue one.\n\nInterior Department officials also recommended that the government invest in programs that could help Native American communities heal from the traumas caused by boarding schools. That includes money for education, violence prevention and the revitalization of indigenous languages. Spending on those efforts should be on a scale proportional to spending on the schools, agency officials said.\n\nThe schools, similar institutions and related assimilation programs were funded by $23.3 billion in inflation-adjusted federal spending, officials determined. Religious and private institutions that ran many of the institutions received federal money as partners in the campaign to \"civilize\" Indigenous students, according to the new report.\n\nBy 1926, most Indigenous school-age children -- some 60,000 children -- were attending boarding schools that were run either by the federal government or religious organizations, according to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.\n\n\"These are stolen generations of children,\" said Deborah Parker, CEO for the Minnesota-based group. \"It's about time the federal government speak so honestly and candidly about the impact.\"\n\nHaaland said her own grandparents were \"stolen from their parents, culture and communities\" at 8 years old and forced to live in a Catholic boarding school until they were 13. Others who went to schools were as young as 4, she said.\n\nMore than 200 of the schools had a religious affiliation, federal officials said. The boarding school coalition has identified more than 100 additional schools not on the government list that were run by churches, with no evidence of federal support.\n\nU.S. Catholic bishops in June apologized for the church's role in trauma the children experienced. And in 2022, Pope Francis apologized for the Catholic Church's cooperation with boarding schools in Canada. He said the forced assimilation of Native peoples into Christian society destroyed their cultures, severed families and marginalized generations.\n\nLegislation pending before Congress would establish a \"Truth and Healing Commission\" to further document and acknowledge past injustices related to boarding schools.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast

Over the years, former students have spoken out about their experiences at the schools, detailing being punished for speaking their native language, getting locked in basements, and having their hair cut to stamp out their identities. Matthew Brown/Associated Press file\n\nBILLINGS, Mont. -- At least 973 Native American children died in the U.S. government's abusive boarding school system, according to the results of an investigation released Tuesday by Interior Department officials who called on the government to apologize for the schools.\n\nThe investigation commissioned by Interior Secretary Deb Haaland found marked and unmarked graves at 65 of the more than 400 U.S. boarding schools where Native American children were forcibly assimilated into white society. The findings don't specify how each child died, but officials said the causes of death included disease and abuse during a 150-year period that ended in 1969.\n\nAdditional children may have died after becoming sick at school and being sent home, officials said.\n\nThe findings follow a series of listening sessions held by Haaland over the past two years in which dozens of former students recounted harmful and often degrading treatment they endured at the hands of teachers and administrators while separated from their families.\n\n\"The federal government took deliberate and strategic action through boarding school policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures, and connections that are foundational to Native people,\" Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe in New Mexico and the country's first Native American Cabinet secretary, said in a Tuesday call with reporters.\n\n\"Make no mistake,\" she added, \"This was a concerted attempt to eradicate the quote, 'Indian problem' - to either assimilate or destroy native peoples altogether.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn their initial findings two yeas ago, officials had estimated more than 500 American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian children died at the schools. The federal government passed laws and policies in 1819 to support the schools, which were still operating in the 1960s.\n\nThe schools gave Native American kids English names, put them through military drills and forced them to perform manual labor, such as farming, brick-making and working on railroads, officials said.\n\nFormer students shared tearful recollections of their experience during the listening sessions in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Michigan, Arizona, Alaska and other states. They talked about being punished for speaking their native language, getting locked in basements, and having their hair cut to stamp out their identities. They were sometimes subjected to solitary confinement, beatings and the withholding of food. Many left the schools with only basic vocational skills that gave them few job prospects.\n\nDonovan Archambault, 85, the former chairman of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana, said beginning at age 11 he was sent away to boarding schools where he was mistreated, forced to cut his hair and prevented from speaking his native language. He said the experience led him to drink alcohol heavily before he turned his life around more than two decades later. He never talked about his school days with his children until he wrote a book about the experience several years ago.\n\nDonovan Archambault, from the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, speaks about abuses he suffered at government-sponsored Native American boarding schools, during a U.S. Department of Interior event at Montana State University last year. He said the experience led him to drink heavily before he turned his life around more than two decades later. On Tuesday he said an apology is needed from the U.S. government. Matthew Brown/Associated Press file\n\n\"An apology is needed. They should apologize,\" Archambault told The Associated Press by phone Tuesday. \"But there also needs to be a broader education about what happened to us. To me, it's part of a forgotten history.\"\n\nHaaland said she was personally \"sorry beyond words,\" but there should also be a formal apology from the federal government. She didn't say if she would press President Biden to issue one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterior Department officials also recommended that the government invest in programs that could help Native American communities heal from the traumas caused by boarding schools. That includes money for education, violence prevention and the revitalization of indigenous languages - on a scale commensurate with government spending on the schools, agency officials said.\n\nThe schools, similar institutions and related assimilation programs were funded by $23.3 billion in inflation-adjusted federal spending, officials determined. Religious and private institutions that ran many of the institutions received federal money as partners in the campaign to \"civilize\" Indigenous students, according to the new report.\n\nBy the 1920s, most Indigenous school-age children - some 60,000 children - were attending boarding schools that were run either by the federal government or religious organizations, according to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.\n\n\"These are stolen generations of children,\" said Deborah Parker, CEO for the Minnesota-based group. \"It's about time the federal government speak so honestly and candidly about the impact.\"\n\nHaaland said her own grandparents were \"stolen from their parents, culture and communities\" when they were 8 years old and forced to live in a Catholic boarding school until they were 13. Others who went to schools were as young as 4, she said.\n\nMore than 200 schools supported by the government had a religious affiliation, federal officials said. The boarding school coalition has identified more than 100 additional schools not on the government list that were run by churches, with no evidence of federal support.\n\nU.S. Catholic bishops in June apologized for the church's role in trauma the children experienced. And in 2022, Pope Francis apologized for the Catholic Church's cooperation with boarding schools in Canada. He said the forced assimilation of Native peoples into Christian society destroyed their cultures, severed families and marginalized generations.\n\nLegislation pending before Congress would establish a \"Truth and Healing Commission\" to further document past injustices related to boarding schools. The legislation would give the commission authority to subpoena people for evidence.\n\nBut Catholic bishops pushed back against giving that subpoena power in a letter to lawmakers last week. Members of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops wrote that the commission should \"avoid an adversarial posture\" since they are willing to cooperate.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend

The findings don't specify how each child died, but the causes of death included sickness, accidents and abuse during a 150-year period that ended in 1969, officials said.\n\nThe findings follow a series of listening sessions across the United States over the past two years in which dozens of former students recounted the harsh and often degrading treatment they endured while separated from their families.\n\n\"The federal government -- facilitated by the Department I lead -- took deliberate and strategic actions through federal Indian boarding school policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures and connections that are foundational to Native people,\" Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe in New Mexico and the country's first Native American Cabinet secretary, said in a news release Tuesday.\n\nIn an initial report released in 2022, officials estimated that more than 500 children died at the schools. The federal government passed laws and policies in 1819 to support the schools, the last of which were still operating in the 1960s.\n\nThe schools gave Native American children English names, put them through military drills and forced them to perform manual labor, such as farming, brickmaking and working on the railroad, officials said.\n\nFormer students shared tearful recollections of their experience during listening sessions in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Michigan, Arizona, Alaska and other states. They talked about being punished for speaking their native language, being locked in basements and having their hair cut to stamp out their identities. They were sometimes subjected to solitary confinement, beatings and the withholding of food. Many left the schools with only basic vocational skills that gave them few job prospects.\n\nDonovan Archambault, 85, of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana, said he was sent away to boarding schools beginning at age 11 and was mistreated, forced to cut his hair and prevented from speaking his native language. He said he drank heavily before turning his life around more than two decades later, and never discussed his school days with his children until he wrote a book about the experience several years ago.\n\n\"An apology is needed. They should apologize,\" Archambault told The Associated Press by phone Tuesday. \"But there also needs to be a broader education about what happened to us. To me, it's part of a forgotten history.\"\n\nThe new report doesn't specify who should issue the apology on behalf of the federal government, saying only that it should be issued through \"appropriate means and officials to demonstrate that it is made on behalf of the people of the United States and be accompanied by bold and actionable policies.\"\n\nInterior Department officials also recommended that the government invest in programs that could help Native American communities heal from the traumas caused by boarding schools. That includes money for education, violence prevention and the revitalization of indigenous languages. Spending on those efforts should be on a scale proportional to the money spent on the schools, agency officials said.\n\nThe schools, similar institutions and related assimilation programs were funded by more than $23 billion in inflation-adjusted federal spending, officials determined. Religious and private institutions that ran many of the institutions received federal money as partners in the campaign to \"civilize\" Indigenous students, according to the new report.\n\nBy 1926, more than 80% of Indigenous school-age children -- some 60,000 children -- were attending boarding schools that were run either by the federal government or religious organizations, according to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.\n\nLegislation pending before Congress would establish a Truth and Healing Commission to document and acknowledge past injustices related to boarding schools. The measure is sponsored in the Senate by Democrat Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and backed by Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The findings don't specify how each child died, but the causes of death included sickness, accidents and abuse during a 150-year period that ended in 1969, officials said.\n\nThe findings follow a series of listening sessions across the U.S. over the past two years in which dozens of former students recounted the harsh and often degrading treatment they endured while separated from their families.\n\n\"The federal government -- facilitated by the Department I lead -- took deliberate and strategic actions through federal Indian boarding school policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures and connections that are foundational to Native people,\" Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe in New Mexico and the country's first Native American Cabinet secretary, said in a news release Tuesday.\n\nIn an initial report released in 2022, officials estimated that more than 500 children died at the schools. The federal government passed laws and policies in 1819 to support the schools, the last of which were still operating in the 1960s.\n\nThe schools gave Native American kids English names, put them through military drills and forced them to perform manual labor, such as farming, brick-making and working on the railroad, officials said.\n\nFormer students shared tearful recollections of their experience during listening sessions in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Michigan, Arizona, Alaska and other states. They talked about being punished for speaking their native language, getting locked in basements, and having their hair cut to stamp out their identities. They were sometimes subjected to solitary confinement, beatings and the withholding of food. Many left the schools with only basic vocational skills that gave them few job prospects.\n\nDonovan Archambault, 85, of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana, said he was sent away to boarding schools beginning at age 11 and was mistreated, forced to cut his hair and prevented from speaking his native language. He said he drank heavily before turning his life around more than two decades later, and never discussed his school days with his children until he wrote a book about the experience several years ago.\n\n\"An apology is needed. They should apologize,\" Archambault told The Associated Press by phone Tuesday. \"But there also needs to be a broader education about what happened to us. To me, it's part of a forgotten history.\"\n\nThe new report doesn't specify who should issue the apology on behalf of the federal government, saying only that it should be issued through \"appropriate means and officials to demonstrate that it is made on behalf of the people of the United States and be accompanied by bold and actionable policies.\"\n\nInterior Department officials also recommended that the government invest in programs that could help Native American communities heal from the traumas caused by boarding schools. That includes money for education, violence prevention and the revitalization of indigenous languages. Spending on those efforts should be on a scale proportional to the $23 billion in inflation adjusted spending on the schools, agency officials said.\n\nThe schools, similar institutions and related assimilation programs were funded by more than $23 billion in inflation-adjusted federal spending, officials determined. Religious and private institutions that ran many of the institutions received federal money as partners in the campaign to \"civilize\" Indigenous students, according to the new report.\n\nBy 1926, more than 80% of Indigenous school-age children -- some 60,000 children -- were attending boarding schools that were run either by the federal government or religious organizations, according to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.\n\nThe Minnesota-based group has tallied more than 100 additional schools not on the government list that were run by churches and with no evidence of federal support.\n\nU.S. Catholic bishops in June apologized for the church's role in trauma the children experienced. And in 2022, Pope Francis apologized for the Catholic Church's cooperation with boarding schools in Canada. He said the forced assimilation of Native peoples into Christian society destroyed their cultures, severed families and marginalized generations.\n\nLegislation pending before Congress would establish a \"Truth and Healing Commission\" to document and acknowledge past injustices related to boarding schools. The measure is sponsored in the Senate by Democrat Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and backed by Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\n\n\"It is time the federal government takes responsibility for its harmful policies,\" Murkowski said on the Senate floor last week. \"Our Commission will provide a Native-led process for communities to share the stories, share the truth, and pursue healing.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Discretion is advised.\n\nAt least 973 Native American children died in the U.S. government's abusive boarding school system, according to the results of an investigation released Tuesday by Interior Department officials who called on the government to apologize for the schools.\n\nThe investigation commissioned by Interior Secretary Deb Haaland found marked and unmarked graves at 65 of the more than 400 U.S. boarding schools where Native American children were forcibly assimilated into white society. The findings don't specify how each child died, but officials said the causes of death included sickness and abuse during a 150-year period that ended in 1969.\n\nAdditional children may have died after becoming sick at school and being sent home, officials said.\n\nThe findings follow a series of listening sessions held by Haaland throughout the U.S. over the past two years in which dozens of former students recounted harmful and often degrading treatment they endured while separated from their families.\n\n\"The federal government took deliberate and strategic action through boarding school policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures, and connections that are foundational to Native people,\" Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe in New Mexico and the country's first Native American Cabinet secretary, said in a Tuesday call with reporters.\n\n\"Make no mistake,\" she added, \"This was a concerted attempt to eradicate the quote, 'Indian problem' -- to either assimilate or destroy native peoples altogether.\"\n\nIn their initial findings two yeas ago, officials had estimated that more than 500 children died at the schools. The federal government passed laws and policies in 1819 to support the schools, which were still operating in the 1960s.\n\nThe schools gave Native American kids English names, put them through military drills and forced them to perform manual labour, such as farming, brick-making and working on the railroad, officials said.\n\nFormer students shared tearful recollections of their experience during the listening sessions in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Michigan, Arizona, Alaska and other states. They talked about being punished for speaking their native language, getting locked in basements, and having their hair cut to stamp out their identities. They were sometimes subjected to solitary confinement, beatings and the withholding of food. Many left the schools with only basic vocational skills that gave them few job prospects.\n\nDonovan Archambault, 85, the former chairman of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana, said beginning at age 11 he was sent away to boarding schools where he was mistreated, forced to cut his hair and prevented from speaking his native language. He said the experience led him to drink alcohol heavily before he turned his life around more than two decades later. He never talked about his school days with his children until he wrote a book about the experience several years ago.\n\n\"An apology is needed. They should apologize,\" Archambault told The Associated Press by phone Tuesday. \"But there also needs to be a broader education about what happened to us. To me, it's part of a forgotten history.\"\n\nHaaland said she was personally \"sorry beyond words,\" but there should also be a formal apology from the federal government. She didn't say if she would push U.S. President Joe Biden to issue one.\n\nInterior Department officials also recommended that the government invest in programs that could help Native American communities heal from the traumas caused by boarding schools. That includes money for education, violence prevention and the revitalization of indigenous languages. Spending on those efforts should be on a scale proportional to spending on the schools, agency officials said.\n\nThe schools, similar institutions and related assimilation programs were funded by US$23.3 billion in inflation-adjusted federal spending, officials determined. Religious and private institutions that ran many of the institutions received federal money as partners in the campaign to \"civilize\" Indigenous students, according to the new report.\n\nBy the 1920s, most Indigenous school-age children -- some 60,000 children -- were attending boarding schools that were run either by the federal government or religious organizations, according to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.\n\n\"These are stolen generations of children,\" said Deborah Parker, CEO for the Minnesota-based group. \"It's about time the federal government speak so honestly and candidly about the impact.\"\n\nHaaland said her own grandparents were \"stolen from their parents, culture and communities\" at eight years old and forced to live in a Catholic boarding school until they were 13. Others who went to schools were as young as four, she said.\n\nMore than 200 of the schools had a religious affiliation, federal officials said. The boarding school coalition has identified more than 100 additional schools not on the government list that were run by churches, with no evidence of federal support.\n\nU.S. Catholic bishops in June apologized for the church's role in trauma the children experienced. And in 2022, Pope Francis apologized for the Catholic Church's cooperation with boarding schools in Canada. He said the forced assimilation of Native peoples into Christian society destroyed their cultures, severed families and marginalized generations.\n\nLegislation pending before Congress would establish a \"Truth and Healing Commission\" to further document past injustices related to boarding schools. The legislation would give the commission authority to subpoena people for evidence.\n\nBut Catholic bishops pushed back against giving that subpoena power in a letter to lawmakers last week. Members of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops wrote that the commission should \"avoid an adversarial posture\" since they are willing to cooperate.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType":

The federal government passed laws and policies in 1819 to support the schools, which were still operating in the 1960s.\n\nThe schools gave Native American kids English names, put them through military drills and forced them to perform manual labour, such as farming, brick-making and working on railroads, officials said.\n\nFormer students shared tearful recollections of their experience during the listening sessions in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Michigan, Arizona, Alaska and other states. They talked about being punished for speaking their native language, getting locked in basements, and having their hair cut to stamp out their identities.\n\nThey were sometimes subjected to solitary confinement, beatings and the withholding of food. Many left the schools with only basic vocational skills that gave them few job prospects.\n\nDonovan Archambault, 85, the former chairman of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana, said beginning at age 11 he was sent away to boarding schools where he was mistreated, forced to cut his hair and prevented from speaking his native language.\n\nHe said the experience led him to drink alcohol heavily before he turned his life around more than two decades later. He never talked about his school days with his children until he wrote a book about the experience several years ago.\n\n\"An apology is needed. They should apologise,\" Archambault told The Associated Press by phone on Tuesday. \"But there also needs to be a broader education about what happened to us. To me, it's part of a forgotten history.\"\n\nHaaland said she was personally \"sorry beyond words\", but there should also be a formal apology from the federal government. She didn't say if she would press President Joe Biden to issue one.\n\nInterior Department officials also recommended that the government invest in programs that could help Native American communities heal from the traumas caused by boarding schools. That includes money for education, violence prevention and the revitalisation of indigenous languages -- on a scale commensurate with government spending on the schools, agency officials said.\n\nThe schools, similar institutions and related assimilation programs were funded by $23.3 billion in inflation-adjusted federal spending, officials determined.\n\nReligious and private institutions that ran many of the institutions received federal money as partners in the campaign to \"civilise\" Indigenous students, according to the new report.\n\nBy the 1920s, most Indigenous school-age children, some 60,000 children, were attending boarding schools that were run either by the federal government or religious organisations, according to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.\n\n\"These are stolen generations of children,\" said Deborah Parker, CEO of the Minnesota-based group. \"It's about time the federal government spoke so honestly and candidly about the impact.\"\n\nHaaland said her own grandparents were \"stolen from their parents, culture and communities\" when they were 8 years old and forced to live in a Catholic boarding school until they were 13. Others who went to school were as young as 4, she said.\n\nMore than 200 schools supported by the government had a religious affiliation, federal officials said. The boarding school coalition has identified more than 100 additional schools not on the government list that were run by churches, with no evidence of federal support.\n\nUS Catholic bishops in June apologised for the church's role in the trauma the children experienced.\n\nAnd in 2022, Pope Francis apologised for the Catholic Church's cooperation with boarding schools in Canada. He said the forced assimilation of Native peoples into Christian society destroyed their cultures, severed families and marginalized generations.\n\nLegislation pending before Congress would establish a \"Truth and Healing Commission\" to further document past injustices related to boarding schools. The legislation would give the commission authority to subpoena people for evidence.\n\nBut Catholic bishops pushed back against giving that subpoena power in a letter to lawmakers last week.\n\nMembers of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops wrote that the commission should \"avoid an adversarial posture\" since they are willing to cooperate.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in",

(AP) -- At least 973 Native American children died in the U.S. government's abusive boarding school system, according to an investigation released Tuesday by Interior Department officials who called on the government to apologize for the schools.\n\nThe investigation commissioned by Interior Secretary Deb Haaland found marked and unmarked graves at 65 of the more than 400 U.S. boarding schools where Native American children were forcibly assimilated into white society. The findings did not specify how each child died, but officials said the causes of death included disease and abuse over a 150-year period that ended in 1969.\n\nOther children may have died after falling ill at school and being sent home, authorities said.\n\nThe findings follow a series of listening sessions held by Haaland over the past two years, in which dozens of former students recounted the harmful and often degrading treatment they suffered at the hands of teachers and administrators while separated from their families.\n\nThe federal government has taken deliberate and strategic steps, through boarding school policies, to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities and rob them of the languages, cultures and connections that are fundamental to Indigenous peoples, Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe in New Mexico and the nation's first Native American cabinet secretary, said on a call with reporters Tuesday.\n\nMake no mistake, she added, this is a concerted attempt to eradicate the Indian problem, either to assimilate or to completely destroy the native peoples.\n\nIn their initial findings two years ago, officials estimated that more than 500 American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian children died in the schools. The federal government passed laws and policies in 1819 to support the schools, which were still operating in the 1960s.\n\nThe schools gave Native American children English names, subjected them to military drills and forced them to do manual labor, such as farming, brick making and working on railroads, officials said.\n\nFormer students shared moving memories of their experiences at listening sessions in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Michigan, Arizona, Alaska and other states. They described being punished for speaking their native language, locked in basements and having their hair cut to erase their identities. They were sometimes subjected to solitary confinement, beatings and starvation. Many left the schools with only basic job skills that offered few job prospects.\n\nDonovan Archambault, 85, a former president of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana, said that starting at age 11, he was sent to boarding schools where he was abused, forced to cut his hair and prevented from speaking his native language. He said the experience led him to drink heavily before turning his life around more than two decades later. He never spoke about his school years with his children until he wrote a book about the experience several years ago.\n\n\"An apology is needed. They should apologize,\" Archambault told The Associated Press by telephone Tuesday. \"But there also needs to be broader education about what happened to us. To me, it's part of a forgotten history.\"\n\nHaaland said she was personally sorry beyond words, but that the federal government should also issue a formal apology. She did not say whether she would pressure President Joe Biden to issue one.\n\nInterior Department officials also recommended the government invest in programs that could help Native American communities recover from the trauma caused by boarding schools. That includes funding for education, violence prevention and revitalizing indigenous languages on a scale proportional to government spending on schools, agency officials said.\n\nThe schools, similar institutions and related assimilation programs were funded with $23.3 billion in inflation-adjusted federal spending, officials determined. The religious and private institutions that ran many of these institutions received federal funds as partners in the campaign to civilize Native students, the new report said.\n\nIn the 1920s, most school-age Native American children -- some 60,000 children -- attended boarding schools run either by the federal government or by religious organizations, according to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.\n\n\"These are generations of children stolen,\" said Deborah Parker, CEO of the Minnesota-based nonprofit. \"It's time for the federal government to talk as honestly and candidly about the impact of this.\"\n\nHaaland said her own grandparents were taken from their parents, culture and community when they were 8 years old and forced to live in a Catholic boarding school until they were 13. Others who attended the school were as young as 4, she said.\n\nAccording to federal authorities, more than 200 government-supported schools had religious affiliations. The boarding school coalition identified more than 100 other schools that were not on the government list and were run by churches, with no evidence of federal support.\n\nIn June, U.S. Catholic bishops apologized for the church's role in the children's trauma. And in 2022, Pope Francis apologized for the Catholic Church's cooperation with boarding schools in Canada. He said the forced assimilation of Indigenous peoples into Christian society had destroyed their cultures, separated families and marginalized generations.\n\nA bill currently before Congress would create a Truth and Healing Commission to document past injustices related to boarding schools. The law would give the commission the power to subpoena people to provide evidence.\n\nBut the Catholic bishops declined to grant that subpoena power in a letter to lawmakers last week. Members of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops wrote that the commission should avoid confrontation because they are willing to cooperate.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance

The Interior Department also called for billions in federal funding to begin a \"healing\" process.\n\nThe report concludes a three-year investigation that saw, for the first time, the federal government accepting responsibility for its role in creating the system, which included more than 400 schools across 37 states.\n\n\"The federal government - facilitated by the Department I lead - took deliberate and strategic actions through federal Indian boarding school policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures and connections that are foundational to Native people,\" Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement.\n\nThe report calculates that the federal government spent the equivalent of $23 billion in today's dollars on the boarding school system from 1871 to 1969, and calls for spending an equivalent amount toward rebuilding families and communities.\n\nAmong the proposed initiatives are a national memorial to \"acknowledge and commemorate\" the experiences of tribes, and a plan to return the land on which the boarding schools were located to government or tribal ownership.\n\nThe new report expands upon the previously acknowledged size and scope of the system, adding more schools and burial grounds to the administration's final portrait of the gruesome system, and including oral histories that detailed decades of abuse and maltreatment.\n\nFor the past two years, Haaland and staff from the Interior Department have visited tribal communities around the country, hearing from survivors and their famlies.\n\n\"As we have learned over the past three years, these institutions are not just part of our past,\" said Bryan Newland, assistant secretary of Indian affairs. \"Their legacy reaches us today, and is reflected in the wounds people continue to experience in communities across the United States.\"\n\nAt the same time, the department continued its investigation, headed by Newland, of government records to compile an accurate record of the toll from the schools' practices. The final report increased the number of boarding schools in the U.S. from 408 to 417, across 37 states or then-territories.

Overcrowded and unsanitary, the schools became breeding grounds for tuberculosis and other diseases. An estimated 40,000 children died in these boarding schools.\n\nArizona was home to 59 of these schools.\n\nA move is underway in Congress to bring accountability to the federal government for promoting these policies.\n\n\"We cannot rectify the past until we face it head-on,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, said Wednesday evening on the Senate floor as she and a handful of colleagues held forth on the topic. \"There isn't an indigenous community in this country that hasn't been affected.\"\n\nA bipartisan bill that currently has 32 Senate co-sponsors would create a \"Truth and Healing Commission\" akin to those used in post-apartheid South Africa and in other places affected by conflict.\n\nThe commission would investigate Native American boarding schools and the lasting impact they had on families and tribal communities. It would hold hearings to gather witness testimony, and would have subpoena power to dig out documentation and unshroud a history that churches and governmental entities have kept hidden for decades.\n\nThe commission would also make recommendations on whether the dark history of these schools should shape current federal policy.\n\nWarren introduced the bill with Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii. Both senators from Arizona are co-sponsors: Independent Kyrsten Sinema and Democrat Mark Kelly.\n\nOnly Oklahoma had more Native American boarding schools than Arizona, according to lists compiled by the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.\n\n\"It's cheaper to educate Indians than to kill them,\" Thomas Morgan, the federal Indian Affairs Commissioner appointed by President Benjamin Harrison, said at the establishment of the Phoenix Indian School in 1891.\n\nAs Captain Richard Henry Pratt, founder of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania - which became the model for government-run boarding schools - infamously said, \"Kill the Indian, save the man.\"\n\nThe education these schools provided was often inadequate.\n\nChildren were hit, slapped and starved if they dared to speak their native languages, practice their religion or display any behavior that indicated a resistance to assimilation.\n\nThere was also sexual assault.\n\nA recent Washington Post investigation identified 122 priests and student workers at 18 schools alone who had been accused of molesting Native American children under their care. The perpetrators rarely faced repercussions and were instead often moved to other schools. The Catholic Church sent priests to facilities such as the Servants of the Paraclete in New Mexico, set up for clergy with \"personal difficulties.\"\n\nSen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colorado, recounted incidents in his own state. Fort Lewis College used to be known as the \"Fort Lewis Boarding School,\" he recounted as he, Warren and others held the Senate floor to spotlight their commission proposal.\n\nDr. Thomas Breen, superintendent at Fort Lewis, was known for raping girls at the school, the senator said, and staff were instructed to make any student who became pregnant \"disappear.\"\n\n\"Why was our government preying on our own children?\" Hickenlooper said during his impassioned floor remarks.\n\n\"We have not simply a moral responsibility, but a legal obligation to the welfare of tribes across the country to uphold treaty rights, and to recognize the dark history of our own country,\" he said. \"This obligation cannot be met without securing truth, justice and healing for every Native person, family and tribe affected by these genocidal policies.\"\n\nNative American parents who refused to give up their children were incarcerated or had their food rations cut off by the U.S. government.\n\nWarren spoke about armed men sent onto reservations to pry children from their families, some as young as 4.\n\n\"If I was a parent, I would be absolutely catatonic,\" Schatz said.\n\nMany of these parents would never see their children again.\n\nAt least 53 mass graves containing the remains of Native American boarding school children have been found after an investigation launched by Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland - the first Native American to hold a Cabinet position.\n\nHaaland's own parents had been forced to attend these boarding schools.\n\nIt's unclear how many living survivors of the boarding schools remain. Warren and others called it urgent to let them tell their stories before it's too late.\n\n\"Most of those affected have passed away. But there are remaining survivors in their 60s, 70s and beyond,\" Warren said. \"These people have been harmed enough. Their wounds go deep, and they deserve a chance to stand before the United States government and tell their stories.\"", "source": {"uri": "tucsonsentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tucson

The Interior Department also called for billions in federal funding to begin a \"healing\" process.\n\nThe report concludes a three-year investigation that saw, for the first time, the federal government accepting responsibility for its role in creating the system, which included more than 400 schools across 37 states.\n\n\"The federal government - facilitated by the Department I lead - took deliberate and strategic actions through federal Indian boarding school policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures and connections that are foundational to Native people,\" Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement.\n\nThe report calculates that the federal government spent the equivalent of $23 billion in today's dollars on the boarding school system from 1871 to 1969, and calls for spending an equivalent amount toward rebuilding families and communities.\n\nAmong the proposed initiatives are a national memorial to \"acknowledge and commemorate\" the experiences of tribes, and a plan to return the land on which the boarding schools were located to government or tribal ownership.\n\nThe new report expands upon the previously acknowledged size and scope of the system, adding more schools and burial grounds to the administration's final portrait of the gruesome system, and including oral histories that detailed decades of abuse and maltreatment.\n\nFor the past two years, Haaland and staff from the Interior Department have visited tribal communities around the country, hearing from survivors and their famlies.\n\n\"As we have learned over the past three years, these institutions are not just part of our past,\" said Bryan Newland, assistant secretary of Indian affairs. \"Their legacy reaches us today, and is reflected in the wounds people continue to experience in communities across the United States.\"\n\nAt the same time, the department continued its investigation, headed by Newland, of government records to compile an accurate record of the toll from the schools' practices. The final report increased the number of boarding schools in the U.S. from 408 to 417, across 37 states or then-territories. The number includes 22 schools in Alaska and seven in Hawaii.\n\nAnd the report confirms that at least 973 American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children died while attending schools in the system. The Department acknowledges that the actual number of children who died while attending Indian boarding schools is likely greater.\n\n\"This report further proves what Indigenous peoples across the country have known for generations: That federal policies were set out to break us, obtain our territories, and destroy our cultures and our lifeways,\" Newland, a member of the Bay Mills Indian Community, said in a statement,\n\nThe investigation also confirms that there are at least 74 marked or unmarked burial sites at 65 of the schools. One initiative proposed in the report is to identify and repatriate the remains of children who never returned home from the schools.\n\nIn the opening letter of the report, Newland says: \"The most important thing is that our work to tell the truth about the Federal Indian boarding school system be paired with action.\"\n\nThe final report seeks to put a price on that action, arguing that the government could begin to remedy the trauma inflicted in over a century of forced assimilation by investing \"on a scale, that is, at a minimum, commensurate with the investments made in the Federal Indian boarding school system between 1871 and 1969.\"\n\nIn other words, investing $23.3 billion back to the tribes, spread out over a long period of time. The report advocates spending on programs such as family reunification, language revitalization, and Indian education - programs intended to address the ways in which the boarding school system wreaked havoc on tribal communities.\n\nA national memorial to acknowledge the harm to tribes and individuals is one part of the proposed plans. It would serve not only tribal members, the report says, but would also help educate the broader population about the dark time in the country's history.\n\nApart from these investments, the report calls on the U.S. government to issue a formal apology, and to continue the work of chronicling this period of history.\n\n\"The Road to Healing,\" Haaland said, \"does not end with this report - it is just beginning.\"", "source": {"uri": "kgou.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KGOU 106.3"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boarding_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boarding school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_boarding_schools", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Indian boarding schools"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Interior", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Interior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_Haaland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deb Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Interior", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of the Interior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Newland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Newland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oral history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Natives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Natives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Hawaiians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Native Hawaiians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Mills_Indian_Community", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bay Mills Indian Community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_revitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Language revitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_assimilation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forced assimilation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Repatriation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School_Meals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School Meals", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4c7e122/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4961x2791+0+465/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnpr.brightspotcdn.com%2Fdims3%2Fdefault%2Fstrip%2Ffalse%2Fcrop%2F4961x3721%20310%200%2Fresize%2F4961x3721%21%2F%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F47%2Fb5%2F39a89da54416a81c2365d44fa3ae%2Fgettyimages-1487091986.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776774", "eventUri": "eng-9776774", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- At least 973 Native American children died in the U.S. government's abusive boarding school system, according to the results of an investigation released Tuesday by officials who called on the government to apologize for the schools.\n\nThe investigation commissioned by Interior Sec. Deb Haaland found marked and unmarked graves at 65 of the more than 400 U.S. boarding schools that were established to forcibly assimilate Native American children into white society. The findings don't specify how each child died, but the causes of death included sickness, accidents and abuse during a 150-year period that ended in 1969, officials said.\n\nThe findings follow a series of listening sessions across the U.S. over the past two years in which dozens of former students recounted the harsh and often degrading treatment they endured while separated from their families.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The federal government passed laws and policies in 1819 to support the schools, the last of which were still operating in the 1960s.\n\nThe schools gave Native American kids English names, put them through military drills and forced them to perform manual labor, such as farming, brick-making and working on the railroad, officials said.\n\nFormer students shared tearful recollections of their experience during listening sessions in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Michigan, Arizona, Alaska and other states. They talked about being punished for speaking their native language, getting locked in basements, and having their hair cut to stamp out their identities. They were sometimes subjected to solitary confinement, beatings and the withholding of food. Many left the schools with only basic vocational skills that gave them few job prospects.\n\nDonovan Archambault, 85, of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana, said he was sent away to boarding schools beginning at age 11 and was mistreated, forced to cut his hair and prevented from speaking his native language. He said he drank heavily before turning his life around more than two decades later, and never discussed his school days with his children until he wrote a book about the experience several years ago.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"An apology is needed. They should apologize,\" Archambault told The Associated Press by phone Tuesday. \"But there also needs to be a broader education about what happened to us. To me, it's part of a forgotten history.\"\n\nThe new report doesn't specify who should issue the apology on behalf of the federal government, saying only that it should be issued through \"appropriate means and officials to demonstrate that it is made on behalf of the people of the United States and be accompanied by bold and actionable policies.\"\n\nInterior Department officials also recommended that the government invest in programs that could help Native American communities heal from the traumas caused by boarding schools. That includes money for education, violence prevention and the revitalization of indigenous languages. Spending on those efforts should be on a scale proportional to the $23 billion in inflation adjusted spending on the schools, agency officials said.\n\nThe schools, similar institutions and related assimilation programs were funded by more than $23 billion in inflation-adjusted federal spending, officials determined. Religious and private institutions that ran many of the institutions received federal money as partners in the campaign to \"civilize\" Indigenous students, according to the new report.\n\nBy 1926, more than 80% of Indigenous school-age children -- some 60,000 children -- were attending boarding schools that were run either by the federal government or religious organizations, according to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.\n\nThe Minnesota-based group has tallied more than 100 additional schools not on the government list that were run by churches and with no evidence of federal support.\n\nU.S. Catholic bishops in June apologized for the church's role in trauma the children experienced. And in 2022, Pope Francis apologized for the Catholic Church's cooperation with boarding schools in Canada. He said the forced assimilation of Native peoples into Christian society destroyed their cultures, severed families and marginalized generations.\n\nLegislation pending before Congress would establish a \"Truth and Healing Commission\" to document and acknowledge past injustices related to boarding schools. The measure is sponsored in the Senate by Democrat Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and backed by Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\n\n\"It is time the federal government takes responsibility for its harmful policies,\" Murkowski said on the Senate floor last week. \"Our Commission will provide a Native-led process for communities to share the stories, share the truth, and pursue healing.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The findings don't specify how each child died, but officials said the causes of death included disease and abuse during a 150-year period that ended in 1969.\n\nAdditional children may have died after becoming sick at school and being sent home, officials said.\n\nThe findings follow a series of listening sessions held by Haaland over the past two years in which dozens of former students recounted harmful and often degrading treatment they endured at the hands of teachers and administrators while separated from their families.\n\n\"The federal government took deliberate and strategic action through boarding school policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures, and connections that are foundational to Native people,\" Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe in New Mexico and the country's first Native American Cabinet secretary, said in a Tuesday call with reporters.\n\n\"Make no mistake,\" she added, \"This was a concerted attempt to eradicate the quote, 'Indian problem' -- to either assimilate or destroy native peoples altogether.\"\n\nIn their initial findings two yeas ago, officials had estimated more than 500 American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian children died at the schools. The federal government passed laws and policies in 1819 to support the schools, which were still operating in the 1960s.\n\nThe schools gave Native American kids English names, put them through military drills and forced them to perform manual labor, such as farming, brick-making and working on railroads, officials said.\n\nFormer students shared tearful recollections of their experience during the listening sessions in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Michigan, Arizona, Alaska and other states. They talked about being punished for speaking their native language, getting locked in basements, and having their hair cut to stamp out their identities. They were sometimes subjected to solitary confinement, beatings and the withholding of food. Many left the schools with only basic vocational skills that gave them few job prospects.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors":

Overcrowded and unsanitary, the schools became breeding grounds for tuberculosis and other diseases. An estimated 40,000 children died in these boarding schools.\n\nArizona was home to 59 of these schools.\n\nA move is underway in Congress to bring accountability to the federal government for promoting these policies.\n\n\"We cannot rectify the past until we face it head-on,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, said Wednesday evening on the Senate floor as she and a handful of colleagues held forth on the topic. \"There isn't an Indigenous community in this country that hasn't been affected.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

It would hold hearings to gather witness testimony, and would have subpoena power to dig out documentation and unshroud a history that churches and governmental entities have kept hidden for decades.\n\nThe commission would also make recommendations on whether the dark history of these schools should shape current federal policy.\n\nWarren introduced the bill with Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii. Both senators from Arizona are co-sponsors: Independent Kyrsten Sinema and Democrat Mark Kelly.\n\nOnly Oklahoma had more Native American boarding schools than Arizona, according to lists compiled by the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.\n\n\"It's cheaper to educate Indians than to kill them,\" Thomas Morgan, the federal Indian Affairs Commissioner appointed by President Benjamin Harrison, said at the establishment of the Phoenix Indian School in 1891.\n\nAs Captain Richard Henry Pratt, founder of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania - which became the model for government-run boarding schools - infamously said, \"Kill the Indian, save the man.\"\n\nThe education these schools provided was often inadequate.\n\nChildren were hit, slapped and starved if they dared to speak their native languages, practice their religion or display any behavior that indicated a resistance to assimilation.\n\nThere was also sexual assault.\n\nA recent Washington Post investigation identified 122 priests and student workers at 18 schools alone who had been accused of molesting Native American children under their care. The perpetrators rarely faced repercussions and were instead often moved to other schools. The Catholic Church sent priests to facilities such as the Servants of the Paraclete in New Mexico, set up for clergy with \"personal difficulties.\"\n\nSen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colorado, recounted incidents in his own state. Fort Lewis College used to be known as the \"Fort Lewis Boarding School,\" he recounted as he, Warren and others held the Senate floor to spotlight their commission proposal.\n\nThomas Breen, superintendent at Fort Lewis, was known for raping girls at the school, the senator said, and staff were instructed to make any student who became pregnant \"disappear.\"\n\n\"Why was our government preying on our own children?\" Hickenlooper said during his impassioned floor remarks.\n\n\"We have not simply a moral responsibility, but a legal obligation to the welfare of tribes across the country to uphold treaty rights, and to recognize the dark history of our own country,\" he said. \"This obligation cannot be met without securing truth, justice and healing for every Native person, family and tribe affected by these genocidal policies.\"\n\nNative American parents who refused to give up their children were incarcerated or had their food rations cut off by the U.S. government.\n\nWarren spoke about armed men sent onto reservations to pry children from their families, some as young as 4.\n\n\"If I was a parent, I would be absolutely catatonic,\" Schatz said.\n\nMany of these parents would never see their children again.\n\nAt least 53 mass graves containing the remains of Native American boarding school children have been found after an investigation launched by Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland - the first Native American to hold a Cabinet position.\n\nHaaland's own parents had been forced to attend these boarding schools.\n\nIt's unclear how many living survivors of the boarding schools remain. Warren and others called it urgent to let them tell their stories before it's too late.\n\n\"Most of those affected have passed away. But there are remaining survivors in their 60s, 70s and beyond,\" Warren said. \"These people have been harmed enough. Their wounds go deep, and they deserve a chance to stand before the United States government and tell their stories.\"\n\nSubscribe to stay connected to Tucson.

The second volume builds on the initial volume published in May 2022 to significantly expand on the number and details of institutions to include attendee deaths, the number of burial sites, participation of religious institutions and organizations, and federal dollars spent to operate these locations. It also includes policy recommendations for consideration by Congress and the Executive Branch to continue to chart a path to healing and redress for Indigenous communities.\n\n\"The federal government - facilitated by the Department I lead - took deliberate and strategic actions through federal Indian boarding school policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures and connections that are foundational to Native people. These policies caused enduring trauma for Indigenous communities that the Biden-Harris administration is working tirelessly to repair,\" said Secretary Haaland. \"I am immensely proud of the hundreds of Interior employees - many of them Indigenous - who gave of their time and themselves to ensure that this investigation was thoroughly completed to provide an accurate and honest picture. The Road to Healing does not end with this report - it is just beginning.\"\n\n\"For the first time in the history of the United States, the federal government is accounting for its role in operating historical Indian boarding schools that forcibly confined and attempted to assimilate Indigenous children. This report further proves what Indigenous peoples across the country have known for generations - that federal policies were set out to break us, obtain our territories, and destroy our cultures and our lifeways,\" said Assistant Secretary Newland. \"It is undeniable that those policies failed, and now, we must bring every resource to bear to strengthen what they could not destroy. It is critical that this work endures, and that federal, state and Tribal governments build on the important work accomplished as part of the Initiative.\"\n\nVolume 2 updates the official list of federal Indian boarding schools and maps to include 417 institutions across 37 states or then-territories. It provides detailed profiles of each school and confirms that at least 973 American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children died while attending federal operated or supported schools. It also identifies at least 74 marked and unmarked burial sites at 65 different school sites, and estimates that the U.S. government made appropriations available of more than $23.3 billion in Fiscal Year 2023 inflation-adjusted dollars between 1871 and 1969 for the federal Indian boarding school system as well as other similar institutions and associated assimilation policies.\n\nIn the process of publishing these two volumes, the Department's staff and contractors reviewed approximately 103 million pages of federal records. Secretary Haaland and Assistant Secretary Newland also met with government officials and Indigenous leaders from Australia, Canada and New Zealand to understand the processes they used to address the legacy of similar assimilation policies, to include boarding schools and institutions.\n\nThe report includes eight recommendations for the federal government from Assistant Secretary Newland that aim to support a path to healing the nation, including:\n\nIssuing a formal acknowledgment and apology from the U.S. government regarding its role in adopting and implementing national federal Indian boarding school policies;Investing in remedies to the present-day impacts of the federal Indian boarding school system; Establishing a national memorial to acknowledge and commemorate the experiences of Indian Tribes, individuals, and families affected by the federal Indian boarding school system;Identifying and repatriating remains of children and funerary objects who never returned from federal Indian boarding schools;Returning former federal Indian Boarding school sites to Tribes;Telling the story of federal Indian boarding schools to the American people and global community; Investing in further research regarding the present-day health and economic impacts of the federal Indian boarding school system; andAdvancing international relationships in other countries with similar but their own unique histories of boarding schools or other assimilationist policies.\n\nIn recognition of the damage that federal Indian boarding schools and associated policies had on Native languages, investing in their restoration and preservation has been an early priority of the Biden-Harris administration. In 2021, the Departments of the Interior, Education and Health and Human Services launched an interagency initiative to preserve, protect and promote the rights and freedom of Native Americans to use, practice and develop Native languages. Since then, both Secretary Haaland and Assistant Secretary Newland have traveled with First Lady Jill Biden and other Administration leaders to learn more about how Tribal Nations are leveraging federal investments to revitalize Native languages. The Administration expects to roll out a new ten-year Native Language Strategy by the end of 2024.\n\nTelling the story of the impact of these boarding schools has been a guiding purpose of the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative, including Secretary Haaland's op-ed sharing her own personal history. In late 2023, Secretary Haaland and Assistant Secretary Newland completed \"The Road to Healing,\" a historic 12-stop tour across the country that provided Indigenous survivors the opportunity to share with the federal government their experiences in federal Indian boarding schools for the first time. The Road to Healing events included opportunities to connect survivors with trauma-informed support through the Department of Health and Human Service's Indian Health Service and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The reflections of many of those individuals are included in Volume 2 and transcripts are available on the Federal Boarding School Initiative website.\n\nThe Department also launched an oral history project to document and make accessible to the public the experiences of generations of Indigenous then-children who attended the federal Indian boarding school system. Through a grant from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and with funding from the Mellon Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition is currently interviewing survivors for what will be a collection of first-person narratives. The Department and the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, part of the largest museum, research and education complex in the world, are partnering to explore how best to share with the public the history of the federal Indian boarding school system and its role in U.S. development, with a proposed focus on the never-told-before experiences of survivors.\n\nSome institutions classified as historical federal Indian boarding schools continue to operate in the United States, but without assimilationist intentions or practices, including schools operated or funded by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE). The BIE provides high-quality educational opportunities from early childhood through life, accounting for the mental, physical, religious and cultural aspects of Native learners. Similarly, Kamehameha Schools across the Hawaiian Islands provide critical educational services, to include essential language preservation curriculum, that is unique and foundational to the Native Hawaiian Community.\n\nBoth volumes of the report as well as the associated appendices can be found the Bureau of Indian Affairs website.\n\n/Public Release.

Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images/Getty Images North America hide caption\n\nThe federal government today expanded the number of children known to have died in the repressive boarding school system that, for more than a century, pulled Native American children from their homes and communities. The Interior Department also called for billions in federal funding to begin a \"healing\" process.\n\nThe report concludes a three-year investigation that saw, for the first time, the federal government accepting responsibility for its role in creating the system, which included more than 400 schools across 37 states.\n\n\"The federal government - facilitated by the Department I lead - took deliberate and strategic actions through federal Indian boarding school policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures and connections that are foundational to Native people,\" Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement.\n\nThe report calculates that the federal government spent the equivalent of $23 billion in today's dollars on the boarding school system from 1871 to 1969, and calls for spending an equivalent amount toward rebuilding families and communities.\n\nAmong the proposed initiatives are a national memorial to \"acknowledge and commemorate\" the experiences of tribes, and a plan to return the land on which the boarding schools were located to government or tribal ownership.\n\nThe new report expands upon the previously acknowledged size and scope of the system, adding more schools and burial grounds to the administration's final portrait of the gruesome system, and including oral histories that detailed decades of abuse and maltreatment.\n\nFor the past two years, Haaland and staff from the Interior Department have visited tribal communities around the country, hearing from survivors and their famlies.\n\n\"As we have learned over the past three years, these institutions are not just part of our past,\" said Bryan Newland, assistant secretary of Indian affairs. \"Their legacy reaches us today, and is reflected in the wounds people continue to experience in communities across the United States.\"\n\nAt the same time, the department continued its investigation, headed by Newland, of government records to compile an accurate record of the toll from the schools' practices. The final report increased the number of boarding schools in the U.S. from 408 to 417, across 37 states or then-territories. The number includes 22 schools in Alaska and seven in Hawaii.\n\nAnd the report confirms that at least 973 American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children died while attending schools in the system. The Department acknowledges that the actual number of children who died while attending Indian boarding schools is likely greater.\n\n\"This report further proves what Indigenous peoples across the country have known for generations: That federal policies were set out to break us, obtain our territories, and destroy our cultures and our lifeways,\" Newland, a member of the Bay Mills Indian Community, said in a statement,\n\nThe investigation also confirms that there are at least 74 marked or unmarked burial sites at 65 of the schools. One initiative proposed in the report is to identify and repatriate the remains of children who never returned home from the schools.\n\nIn the opening letter of the report, Newland says: \"The most important thing is that our work to tell the truth about the Federal Indian boarding school system be paired with action.\"\n\nThe final report seeks to put a price on that action, arguing that the government could begin to remedy the trauma inflicted in over a century of forced assimilation by investing \"on a scale, that is, at a minimum, commensurate with the investments made in the Federal Indian boarding school system between 1871 and 1969.\"\n\nIn other words, investing $23.3 billion back to the tribes, spread out over a long period of time. The report advocates spending on programs such as family reunification, language revitalization, and Indian education - programs intended to address the ways in which the boarding school system wreaked havoc on tribal communities.\n\nA national memorial to acknowledge the harm to tribes and individuals is one part of the proposed plans. It would serve not only tribal members, the report says, but would also help educate the broader population about the dark time in the country's history.\n\nApart from these investments, the report calls on the U.S. government to issue a formal apology, and to continue the work of chronicling this period of history.\n\n\"The Road to Healing,\" Haaland said, \"does not end with this report - it is just beginning.\"", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sequoia_carrillo@npr.org", "name": "Sequoia Carrillo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_Haaland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deb Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Interior", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of the Interior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boarding_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boarding school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Interior", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Interior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_boarding_schools", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Indian boarding schools"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Newland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Newland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oral history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Mills_Indian_Community", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bay Mills Indian Community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_revitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Language revitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_assimilation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forced assimilation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Repatriation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Natives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Natives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Hawaiians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Native Hawaiians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School_Meals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School Meals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2276x1280+0+216/resize/1400/quality/100/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F85%2Fbc%2F25b8358f4ebdbb3b384cbdd5cac6%2Fscreenshot-2024-07-30-at-11-24-16-am.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776774", "eventUri": "eng-9776774", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

That is just one of the sobering details found in the second and final volume of a federal investigative report into Indian boarding schools that was released Tuesday.\n\nInterior Secretary Deb Haaland launched the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative in 2021, an effort to recognize and address the impact of federal Indian boarding school policies. In 2022, the first volume of the Initiative's investigative report was released. Haaland and Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs Bryan Newland announced the second volume's release Tuesday and outlined next steps for the federal government, including promoting Native languages and a recommendation that the U.S. government formally apologize.\n\nThe initiative is the first time the federal government has made a comprehensive effort to recognize the legacy of the federal Indian boarding school policies and attempt to address the impact of those policies on Indigenous communities. The team working on the investigative report reviewed over 103 million pages of federal records.\n\n\"It has shed light on this horrific era of our nation's history, a federal agenda to assimilate and eradicate native peoples that was in part carried out by the department I lead,\" Haaland said. \"This trauma is not new to Indigenous people, but it is to many Americans.\"\n\nHaaland is a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and, like many Indigenous people, she has a personal connection to the history of Indian boarding schools.\n\n\"When my maternal grandparents were only 8 years old, they were stolen from their parents, culture and communities and forced to live in a Catholic boarding school until the age of 13,\" said Haaland.\n\n\"My great grandfather was also taken, sent by train thousands of miles away from his small village of Mesita in New Mexico. Many children like them never made it back home.\"\n\nFor more than a century, tens of thousands of Native American children were placed in boarding schools to force assimilation and eradicate Native cultures. The new report updates the list of federal Indian boarding schools. There are 46 schools identified in New Mexico. It also provides school profiles and identifies at least 74 burial sites at 65 schools.\n\nOften records only showed that a child had died, not the specific cause of death, Newland said, and the report was not able to identify all 973 children who died by name, though it was able to identify their tribal affiliation.\n\n\"We do know that there was, historically, a lot of disease outbreaks at these schools. We do know that in many instances, Indian agents would send kids back home if they were sick,\" Newland said. \"They may have died there, rather than at the school itself, and it's very likely that many of those kids died as a result of abuse or the aftereffects of abuse that was done to them at those schools.\"\n\nThe report identified that at least 136 Navajo children and 34 Pueblo children died at boarding schools.\n\nThe new report also comes with a set of eight recommendations for Congress from Newland. They include a formal acknowledgement and apology from the U.S. government for its role in implementing national federal Indian boarding school policies; identifying and repatriating the remains of children to tribes; and investing in remedies for the present-day impacts of the federal Indian boarding school system.\n\n\"Through our interagency effort, alongside the Department of Education and Health and Human Services, we are empowering the protection and promotion of Native languages nationwide with our 10-year strategy forthcoming later this year,\" Haaland said. \"Protecting Native languages was one of the most common requests we heard on the road to healing.\"\n\nAs part of the initiative, Haaland and Newland made 12 stops across Indian country over more than a year to listen to boarding school survivors and their descendants -- \"The Road to Healing\" tour. The tour included stops in the Pueblo of Isleta and the Navajo Nation. The department is also creating a permanent oral history collection of first-person stories from boarding school survivors.\n\n\"Their stories are key to keeping the horrors of this era alive within our national conscience,\" Haaland said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_boarding_schools", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Indian boarding schools"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boarding_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boarding school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_Haaland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deb Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Languages of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Indian_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Indian Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cultural assimilation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Interior", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of the Interior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Natives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Natives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Hawaiians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Native Hawaiians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laguna_Pueblo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laguna Pueblo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Laguna Pueblo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Navajo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueblo_of_Isleta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pueblo of Isleta"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oral history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueblo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pueblo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_Nation", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Navajo Nation"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Navajo Nation"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School_Meals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School Meals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776774", "eventUri": "eng-9776774", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 7}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The federal government passed laws and policies in 1819 to support the schools, the last of which were still operating in the 1960s.\n\nThe schools gave Native American kids English names, put them through military drills and forced them to perform manual labor, such as farming, brick-making and working on the railroad, officials said.\n\nFormer students shared tearful recollections of their experience during listening sessions in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Michigan, Arizona, Alaska and other states. They talked about being punished for speaking their native language, getting locked in basements, and having their hair cut to stamp out their identities. They were sometimes subjected to solitary confinement, beatings and the withholding of food. Many left the schools with only basic vocational skills that gave them few job prospects.\n\nDonovan Archambault, 85, of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana, said he was sent away to boarding schools beginning at age 11 and was mistreated, forced to cut his hair and prevented from speaking his native language. He said he drank heavily before turning his life around more than two decades later, and never discussed his school days with his children until he wrote a book about the experience several years ago.\n\n\"An apology is needed. They should apologize,\" Archambault told The Associated Press by phone Tuesday. \"But there also needs to be a broader education about what happened to us. To me, it's part of a forgotten history.\"\n\nThe new report doesn't specify who should issue the apology on behalf of the federal government, saying only that it should be issued through \"appropriate means and officials to demonstrate that it is made on behalf of the people of the United States and be accompanied by bold and actionable policies.\"\n\nInterior Department officials also recommended that the government invest in programs that could help Native American communities heal from the traumas caused by boarding schools. That includes money for education, violence prevention and the revitalization of indigenous languages. Spending on those efforts should be on a scale proportional to the $23 billion in inflation adjusted spending on the schools, agency officials said.\n\nThe schools, similar institutions and related assimilation programs were funded by $23.3 billion in inflation-adjusted federal spending, officials determined. Religious and private institutions that ran many of the institutions received federal money as partners in the campaign to \"civilize\" Indigenous students, according to the new report.\n\nBy 1926, more than 80% of Indigenous school-age children -- some 60,000 children -- were attending boarding schools that were run either by the federal government or religious organizations, according to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.\n\nThe Minnesota-based group has tallied more than 100 additional schools not on the government list that were run by churches and with no evidence of federal support.\n\nU.S. Catholic bishops in June apologized for the church's role in trauma the children experienced. And in 2022, Pope Francis apologized for the Catholic Church's cooperation with boarding schools in Canada. He said the forced assimilation of Native peoples into Christian society destroyed their cultures, severed families and marginalized generations.\n\nLegislation pending before Congress would establish a \"Truth and Healing Commission\" to document and acknowledge past injustices related to boarding schools. The measure is sponsored in the Senate by Democrat Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and backed by Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\n\n\"It is time the federal government takes responsibility for its harmful policies,\" Murkowski said on the Senate floor last week. \"Our Commission will provide a Native-led process for communities to share the stories, share the truth, and pursue healing.\"",

are foundational to Native people,\" Ms Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe in New Mexico and the country's first Native American Cabinet secretary, said in a news release on Tuesday.\n\nIn an initial report released in 2022, officials estimated that more than 500 children died at the schools.\n\nThe federal government passed laws and policies in 1819 to support the schools, the last of which were still operating in the 1960s.\n\nThe schools gave Native American children English names, put them through military drills and forced them to perform manual labour, such as farming, brick-making and working on the railroad, officials said.\n\nFormer students shared tearful recollections of their experience during listening sessions in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Michigan, Arizona, Alaska and other states.\n\nThey talked about being punished for speaking their native language, getting locked in basements, and having their hair cut to stamp out their identities.\n\nThey were sometimes subjected to solitary confinement, beatings and the withholding of food.\n\nMany left the schools with only basic vocational skills that gave them few job prospects.\n\nThe new report does not specify who should issue the apology on behalf of the federal government, saying only that it should be issued through \"appropriate means and officials to demonstrate that it is made on behalf of the people of the United States and be accompanied by bold and actionable policies\".\n\nInterior department officials also recommended that the government invest in programs that could help Native American communities heal from the traumas caused by boarding schools.\n\nThat includes money for education, violence prevention and the revitalisation of indigenous languages.", "source": {"uri":

Finds", "body": "Nearly 1,000 American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian children died while attending boarding schools that were set up by the U.S. government for the purpose of erasing their tribal ties and cultural practices, according to a report released on Tuesday by the Interior Department.\n\n\"For the first time in the history of the country, the U.S. government is accounting for its role in operating Indian boarding schools to forcibly assimilate Indian children, and working to set us on a path to heal from the wounds inflicted by those schools,\" Bryan Newland, the department's assistant secretary for Indian affairs, wrote this month in a letter to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland that was included in the report.\n\nThe report calls on the federal government to apologize and \"chart a road to healing.\" Its recommendations include creating a national memorial to commemorate the children's deaths and educate the public; investing in research and helping Native communities heal from intergenerational stress and trauma; and revitalizing Native languages.\n\nFrom the early 1800s to the late 1960s, the U.S. government removed Native children from their families and homes and sent them to boarding schools, where they were forcibly assimilated.\n\nIt spent nearly $25 billion in today's dollars on the comprehensive effort, according to the investigative report released on Tuesday, including operating 417 schools across 37 states and territories where children were physically and sexually abused. They were also forcibly converted to Christianity and punished for speaking their Native languages.\n\nThe report identified by name almost 19,000 children who attended a federal school between 1819 and 1969, though the Interior Department acknowledges there were more.\n\nThe accounting of the bodies of Native American children was one of the main goals of a federal initiative begun more than three years ago after Canada discovered the remains of 215 children at the site of a defunct boarding school and announced a similar effort. Ms. Haaland, a Laguna Pueblo citizen and the first Native American cabinet secretary, has led the effort in the United States.\n\nTuesday's report, the second and final from the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative, found that 973 children died at Indian boarding schools and were buried at 74 sites, 21 of which are unmarked. The Interior Department said it was working with tribes that want the remains repatriated.\n\nThough political support eventually faded for the forced assimilation of children, the effects of the uprooting and abuse are still felt by Native communities, according to the report. Children were left with lasting psychological trauma, and studies funded by the National Institutes of Health have linked poor physical health in Native American adults to their attendance at federally run schools as children.\n\nThe department conducted interviews with hundreds of survivors as part of its investigation. Some described widespread sexual abuse at the schools, as well as routine physical abuse. One attendee described newcomers being stripped of their parkas, which were burned in a furnace. Another recalled that many children became \"violently ill\" from highly processed foods like powdered milk and canned meats, and were then beaten for soiling their bedding or clothing.\n\n\"I remember my braids being cut off; washed like we were dirty; talked to us like we were dirty,\" one unnamed participant, from South Dakota, said in the report. \"We were dressed in uniforms.\"\n\nOthers described lasting feelings of abandonment and shame from having their family connections severed when they were taken away to attend the schools.\n\n\"I think the worst part of it was at night, listening to all the other children crying themselves to sleep, crying for their parents and just wanting to go home,\" said another unnamed participant, from Michigan.\n\nA participant from Washington described how her sister, now a grandmother, still could not sleep in the dark and would wake up screaming when the light was turned off because she had been routinely locked in a closet as a young girl.\n\nThe report said that aside from experiencing lasting physical and psychological effects, many children learned only agricultural or manual and domestic labor skills, with tribal economies destabilized by their lack of formal education.\n\nThe report said that although \"a change in our nation's understanding\" had come quickly -- with the troubling history of Indian boarding schools now discussed in books, television shows and movies -- many communities were far from healed.\n\n\"The new report provides critical information that is needed to understand the complete history and impact of the federal Indian boarding school era,\" Beth Wright, a lawyer with the Native American Rights Fund who worked on boarding school cases, said in a statement. \"The next step is for the Department of Interior to provide resources and funding directly to tribal nations who desire to research, address and tell their own stories of the impact the federal Indian boarding school era has had on their own communities and people.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The report also identified 74 burial sites, some unmarked, at 65 schools.\n\nThe report is part of an Interior Department effort to investigate the \"troubled legacy of federal boarding school policies,\" according to a news release. Leaders also hoped to shed light on the schools' intergenerational impacts on Native Americans, the release said.\n\nNo burial sites were found in North Dakota, according to the report. Minnesota had two: the St. Rose/St. Francis Xavier School, also known as the Holy Child Academy, in Avoca and the St. Paul's Industrial School in Clontarf, the report said.\n\nThe report claimed 21 children died while attending North Dakota schools. That included five at the Fort Totten Indian Industrial School and eight each at the Standing Rock Agency Boarding School in Fort Yates and Wahpeton Indian School.\n\nWahpeton's school remains open but is chartered under the Sisseton-Wahpeton Dakota Oyate, according to its website.\n\nIn Minnesota, five children died while attending the Red Lake Boarding and Day School, three died at the Pipestone Indian School and one died at both the Morris Industrial School for Indians and Vermillion Lake Indian School in Tower.\n\nThe Morris school remains open and is a state government school.\n\nNorth Dakota had 14 federal boarding schools, while Minnesota had 20, according to the Interior Department.\n\nTuesday's report is in addition to one released in May 2022, though the most recent report details student deaths, additional burial sites and religious affiliations for the schools.\n\n\"The federal government -- facilitated by the Department I lead -- took deliberate and strategic actions through federal Indian boarding school policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures and connections that are foundational to Native people,\" Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement. \"These policies caused enduring trauma for Indigenous communities that the Biden-Harris administration is working tirelessly to repair.\"\n\nThe report didn't say how many bodies were found in the burial sites or how the children died. Research has found the children who attended the schools were subject to illness and abuse.\n\nIt does include a list of tribes that lost children who attended the boarding schools.\n\nThe Interior Department called on the U.S. government to acknowledge the harm that boarding schools caused and to issue a formal apology for its role in forming the institutions. The agency also called for investments into remedies to \"present-day impacts\" of boarding schools and efforts to identify and repatriate children's remains.\n\nIn addition, the Interior Department recommended establishing a national memorial to commemorate Native Americans who were affected by the schools, return the school sites to tribes, tell the story of boarding schools to the American people and global community, and advance international relationships with countries who share similar histories regarding boarding schools.\n\n\"For the first time in the history of the United States, the federal government is accounting for its role in operating historical Indian boarding schools that forcibly confined and attempted to assimilate Indigenous children,\" Assistant Interior Secretary Bryan Newland said in a statement. \"This report further proves what Indigenous peoples across the country have known for generations -- that federal policies were set out to break us, obtain our territories, and destroy our cultures and our lifeways. It is undeniable that those policies failed, and now, we must bring every resource to bear to strengthen what they could not destroy.\"", "source": {"uri": "inforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The report estimates the federal government spent $23.3 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars over the 150 years supporting the boarding school system and similar assimilation policies.\n\nThere were at least 17 boarding schools in Washington, up and down the Interstate 5 corridor, on the coast, and dotted through the arid grasslands of the eastern parts of the state, according to the Interior Department. Many of them were on present-day tribal land.\n\nTribal nations did not gain the right to run their own schools until 1975, and parents could not prevent their children's placement in off-reservation schools until the Indian Child Welfare Act passed in 1978.\n\nThe report, commissioned by Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, found marked and unmarked graves at 65 of the more than 400 U.S. boarding schools that were established to forcibly assimilate Native American children into white society.\n\nThe actual number of burial sites associated with Indian boarding schools -- and the number of Indigenous children who died there -- is likely far greater, the Interior Department acknowledged. The report also doesn't include details on how each child died, but officials noted the causes of death included sickness, accidents and abuse.\n\nThe findings come after Haaland embarked on a two-year \"Road to Healing\" tour conducting listening sessions at tribes across the United States.\n\nThe tour included a stop at the Tulalip Tribes' gathering hall last year, about 35 miles north of Seattle, where the secretary heard survivors share stories of their brutal experience at Native American boarding schools.\n\nDeborah Parker, a citizen of the Tulalip Tribes and chief executive of the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, welcomed the release of the report, but said the federal government and her organization ultimately need more time and access to records to understand the full picture.\n\n\"The department was able to identify, by name, 18,624 Indian children - that's only a beginning,\" Parker said. \"That's a beginning.\"\n\nThere were an estimated 523 of these boarding schools in the U.S., according to research by the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition. The Interior Department report accounts for 417.\n\nThe report does not include burial sites affiliated with other institutions like day schools, orphanages or stand-alone dormitories, or boarding schools operated by churches and groups that didn't receive federal funding. More than 1,000 institutions involved in the education of Indigenous children did not meet the criteria used in the department's investigation.\n\nA number of children from Washington who died in the schools were identified, including one child from the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, one from the Muckleshoot Tribe, one from the Puyallup Tribe, two from the Quinault Indian Nation, one from the Suquamish Tribe, one from Skagit, one from Snohomish and two from Yakama. The report also accounts for the deaths of 15 Nez Perce children, and others across the West.\n\nThe tribal affiliations of more than 200 children who died at boarding schools were not identified in the report.\n\nSuquamish Tribe Chairman Leonard Forsman said his tribe is still reviewing the report and working to uncover more information about the Suquamish student identified to offer a \"proper resolution.\"\n\n\"We hope this will contribute to the healing of our people from the trauma resulting from the assimilation policies imposed on us by the U.S.,\" he said in a statement.\n\nAt these boarding schools, children were forced to follow militaristic schedules, performed agricultural and manual labor, and in some cases, experienced physical and sexual abuse.\n\nSurvivors have recounted stories of having their mouths washed out with soap and their hair cut, or of school leaders whipping them with ropes and belts. They were punished for speaking their language and practicing their traditions.\n\nBy 1969 -- when the federal support for Native American boarding schools ended -- 25% to 35% of all Native American children had been separated from their families, according to studies conducted by the Association on American Indian Affairs.\n\nGrowing up, Parker said she witnessed how the schools disrupted healthy family relationships, traditions and how people viewed the educational system.\n\nChildren ripped away from their parents were left struggling to create stable homes for their own children years later, said Tulalip Tribes Chair Teri Gobin. Studies have found that the childhood experiences at boarding schools left adults with serious physical and mental health issues, ones that could also be seen among their children.\n\n\"This historical trauma has moved from one generation to the next,\" said Gobin, whose father attended Cushman Indian Hospital, a boarding school that performed medical experiments on students. \"They destroyed their lives, their children's lives.\"\n\nThe healing coalition has been central to the Interior Department's research and is advocating for the creation of a federal commission through Congress to find and analyze the records from the government and church-run boarding schools and uncover the horrific truth publicly. Parker said the coalition hopes the bill's passage would coincide with an apology from the sitting U.S. president, and a commitment to meaningful action.\n\nThe healing coalition and tribal nations are still looking for records of children who never returned home and of unmarked, or poorly marked, burial sites. These are stories and records that have largely been withheld from Indigenous people, Parker said.\n\n\"We deserve truth, we deserve justice and ultimately, we want to heal from this long legacy of abuse,\" said Parker, whose relatives attended boarding schools.\n\nIn addition to a formal apology, the report calls for the U.S. government to invest in programs that could help tribes heal from the intergenerational trauma caused by boarding schools, such as violence prevention and language revitalization.\n\nThat funding should be \"commensurate with the investments made in the Federal Indian boarding school system between 1871 and 1969,\" according to the report's recommendations.\n\n\"We're bringing back our culture, we're bringing back our canoes, we're bringing back our longhouse way of life, and I'm incredibly proud of that,\" Parker said. \"I hope that we continue to do that, and then others learn from Native American people, because we have a lot to give.\"\n\nIf you are a

The most influential and well-known of them was Carlisle Indian Industrial School, a military-style institution launched in 1879 that inspired subsequent schools with the motto declared by its founder, Brig. Gen. Robert Henry Pratt: \"Kill the Indian in him, save the man.\"\n\nAuthors of the newly released federal report called on the U.S. government to acknowledge its role and the resulting harms, to apologize to impacted individuals, families and tribes and to adopt cultural revitalization policies supporting efforts such as language revitalization, traditional food systems and cultural and religious practices, among others.\n\nPersonal accounts stand out in latest report\n\nThe report, released Tuesday, is built on one issued in May 2022 that included the first official list of the 417 federally run Indian boarding schools across the United States. It documented the conditions experienced by children there. About half the schools were operated by religious organizations, the report said.\n\nIt was the personal accounts that stood out in Tuesday's report. One former student recalled that after the kids had all been taken from their homes, \"the village was so quiet because there was no children. No children in the village.\"\n\nAnother former student recalled the despair evident throughout the night, \"listening to all the other children crying themselves to sleep, crying for their parents and just wanting to go home.\"\n\nHaaland launched the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative in 2021 to investigate and document the \"troubled legacy\" of how the federal schools and an additional 1,025 religious and privately operated schools worked to assimilate Indian children by removing them from their homes to sometimes remote military-style schools where they were systemically deprived of language, culture and family life.\n\n\"We're here because our ancestors persisted,\" Haaland said during a call with reporters Tuesday. \"It's our duty to share those stories with the world.\"\n\nThe report noted that the tally does not account for all children, including those who attended Indian boarding schools beyond the 150-year period or who were sent to boarding schools run by religious institutions and organizations that did not receive federal government support.\n\n\"The Department acknowledges that the actual number of children who died while in Indian boarding schools is greater,\" the report said.\n\nMore than apology needed, report says\n\nStudents, their families and entire communities have endured disruption from the boarding school system for nearly 200 years, the report said. Tribes deal with domestic violence, substance abuse and adverse childhood experiences that often result in reduced cognitive abilities through adulthood, along with other social ills.\n\nNewland, the Assistant Interior Secretary, recommended multiple measures for the federal government to pursue in addition to a formal acknowledgement and apology.\n\nThose included addressing the present-day impacts of the boarding school system, establishment of a national memorial acknowledging the experiences of those affected by its harms, identification and repatriation of remains of children who never returned home from boarding schools and the return of former federal boarding school sites to tribes.\n\n\"Truth and reconciliation are not beyond our reach,\" Iron Eyes said. \"The United States must assist in providing paths to recovery.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The US National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).\n\nAt least 973 Indigenous children died while attending boarding schools run or supported by the United States government, a federal report has found, prompting calls for an apology for the pain suffered at the abuse-riddled institutions.\n\nThe report, released on Tuesday and commissioned by US Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, found dozens of marked and unmarked graves at 65 of the more than 400 US boarding schools that were established across the country.\n\nThe findings don't specify how each child died, but the causes of death included sickness, accidents and abuse during a 150-year period that ended in 1969, officials said.\n\nThe schools were set up to forcibly assimilate Indigenous children into white society, and survivors have described the intergenerational trauma their families and communities continue to experience as a result of the institutions.\n\nChildren were often prevented from speaking their own languages and separated from siblings, and many were subjected to physical, sexual and psychological abuse.\n\nOn Tuesday, Haaland - the first Indigenous person to lead the US Department of the Interior - said the investigation aimed \"to provide an accurate and honest picture\" of what happened.\n\n\"The federal government - facilitated by the Department I lead - took deliberate and strategic actions through federal Indian boarding school policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures and connections that are foundational to Native people,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"The Road to Healing does not end with this report - it is just beginning.\"\n\nIndigenous community leaders in the US and its northern neighbour Canada - which also operated similar forced-assimilation institutions for Indigenous children - have called on authorities to fund investigations into unmarked graves at the former school sites.\n\nThe discovery of hundreds of suspected grave sites in Canada's westernmost province of British Columbia in 2021 prompted a national reckoning, with several communities launching searches for the remains of children who never came home.\n\nMore than 150,000 First Nation, Inuit and Metis children in Canada were forced to attend the institutions - known as residential schools - between the late 1800s and 1990s.\n\nIn the US, hundreds of thousands of children were forcibly placed in boarding schools between 1869 and the 1960s, according to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.\n\nThe coalition says on its website that by 1926, nearly 83 percent of school-aged Indigenous children were attending the institutions.\n\nThe findings in Tuesday's report follow a series of listening sessions across the US over the past two years in which dozens of former students recounted the harsh and often degrading treatment they endured while separated from their families.\n\nIn an initial report released in 2022, officials estimated that more than 500 children died at the schools, which the federal government had supported through laws and policies.\n\nThe schools, similar institutions and related assimilation programmes were funded by more than $23bn in inflation-adjusted federal spending, US officials determined.\n\nReligious and private institutions that ran many of the institutions received federal money as partners in the campaign to \"civilize\" Indigenous students, according to Tuesday's report.\n\nThe Interior Department officials offered eight recommendations for the US government, including \"issuing a formal acknowledgment and apology ... regarding its role in adopting and implementing national federal Indian boarding school policies\".\n\nThey also urged Washington to invest in remedies for the system's continuing effects; to establish a national memorial to acknowledge and commemorate all those affected, and to identify and repatriate the remains of children who died at the schools.\n\nDonovan Archambault, 85, of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana, said he was sent away to boarding schools beginning at age 11 and was mistreated, forced to cut his hair and prevented from speaking his native language.\n\nHe said he drank heavily before turning his life around more than two decades later, and never discussed his school days with his children until he wrote a book about the experience several years ago.\n\n\"An apology is needed. They should apologise,\" Archambault told The Associated Press news agency on Tuesday. \"But there also needs to be a broader education about what happened to us. To me, it's part of a forgotten history.\"", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Entire generations paid the price for a failed federal policy.\n\nThese and other facts punctuated the second report on the troubled legacy of Indian boarding school policies and the federal government's attempt to assimilate tribes by removing children as young as age 4 to military-style schools.\n\nBut it was the personal accounts that stood out Tuesday in the second and final volume of a groundbreaking report on the toll the federal Indian boarding schools exacted on tribal communities, families and children.\n\n\"I think the worst part of it was at night, listening to all the other children crying themselves to sleep, crying for their parents, and just wanting to go home,\" one former student said.\n\n\"My aunt said after we all left, after the planes came and we all left, she said the village was so quiet because there was no children. No children in the village,\" another student from Alaska told a panel convened to hear from boarding students and their families.\n\nInterior Secretary Deb Haaland released the report Tuesday, following up on the first from 2022. This one contained more accurate information about how federal assimilation policies, including boarding schools and the wholesale removal of children handed off for adoption by non-Native families, caused havoc and disruption in Indigenous communities throughout the U.S.\n\nFederal Indian boarding schools examined\n\nHaaland launched the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative in 2021 to investigate and document the \"troubled legacy\" of how the 417 federal schools and another 1,025 religious and privately operated schools worked to assimilate Indian children by removing them from their homes to sometimes remote military-style schools where they were systemically deprived of language, culture and family life.\n\n\"We're here because our ancestors persisted,\" Haaland said during a call with reporters Tuesday. \"It's our duty to share those stories with the world.\"\n\nThe Interior Department's team identified 417 Federal schools operating on 451 sites across 37 states or then-territories, including 22 schools in Alaska and 7 schools in Hawaii, between 1819 and 1969. The report found that religious organizations operated nearly half of the 417 federal schools, while another 59 schools run by religious groups received federal dollars.\n\nBryan Newland, assistant secretary for Indian Affairs, said investigators also identified 1,025 other institutions that were not run by the federal government but by religious organizations.\n\nThe report also provided detailed profiles on the federal institutions, Newland said.\n\nInvestigators pored through 103 million pages of records to locate at least 18,624 Indian, Alaska Native and Hawaiian children who were taken into the federal Indian boarding school system between 1819 and 1969, but they admitted the numbers are not complete.\n\nFor one thing, the report noted, children in the system outside of the study period would not be counted. Also, records from non-federal religious or private schools were not available. Other schools like day schools, sanitariums, asylums, orphanages, stand-alone dormitories and schools operated without government support also were not counted.\n\nThe report also estimated that more than $23.3 billion in fiscal year 2023 inflation-adjusted dollars were appropriated from 1871 to 1969 to run the schools and similar institutions and associated policies.\n\nDeaths at boarding schools are likely underreported\n\nThe report identified 973 children who died while attending one of the federal boarding schools. That number included 249 students from Arizona tribes. The three largest tribes in Arizona suffered the greatest losses. The Navajo Nation lost 135 children plus one from the Ramah Navajo Reservation in New Mexico; the four Apache tribes in Arizona suffered 49 deaths; and the O'odham tribes lost 41 students.\n\nThose figures are also likely far less than the number of children who perished. Some burial sites contain human remains of multiple people or burials of people relocated from other sites. This prevents tribes from the ability to identify those individuals.\n\nThe report also identified schools with onsite and offsite burial sites. The Phoenix Indian School, which operated from 1891 to 1990, did not have an onsite cemetery to inter the estimated 23 children who perished there.\n\nStudents, their families and entire communities have endured disruption from the boarding school system for nearly 200 years, the report said. Tribes are dealing with domestic violence, substance abuse and adverse childhood experiences often resulting in reduced cognitive abilities through adulthood, along with other social ills.\n\nThose effects include the government's next failed tribal assimilation policy: the wholesale removal of Indian children to be adopted into non-Native families. That policy persisted until 1978 with the enactment of the Indian Child Welfare Act, although Native kids are still removed from homes at greater rates than other groups.\n\nA price paid: Native families welcome children home, but 'long road' not over for others\n\nWhat's next in 'The Road to Healing'\n\nThe boarding school initiative included hearing the experiences of boarding school survivors and their families about the school experience and how it affected their lives and those of their descendants during \"The Road to Healing,\" a series of listening sessions across the U.S.\n\n\"We listened, we wept and we began to heal,\" Haaland said.\n\nThe Interior Department held one of those sessions in the Gila River Indian Community in 2023.\n\nThe report includes eight recommendations for the federal government from Assistant Secretary Newland that aim to support a path to healing the nation, including:\n\nAn oral history project launched in 2023 will continue to collect and make public boarding school students' experiences. The National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, which has been recording boarding school survivors' accounts and advocating for support services, will receive $3.7 million in grant funding to help facilitate this project.\n\nNewland and Haaland also said that language revitalization was one of the most-asked-for points during the 12-stop \"Road to Healing\" tour. Haaland said the departments of Education, Health and Human Services and Interior were developing a 10-year strategy to promote language revivals in tribal communities.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has supported the generation of the report, Haaland said, and she expects him to read it. She believes Biden and First Lady Jill Biden support language revitalization efforts.\n\n\"President Biden has made many promises and kept many promises to Indian County,\" Haaland said.\n\nNewland said families and students have also been calling for community-based, trauma-informed healing care, family-strengthening programs and reductions in Native kids being pulled into foster care, and programs to address domestic violence to deal with the intergenerational effects of the schools and other federal policies.\n\n\"There's a lot of work to be done to turn these broad recommendations into specific strategies,\" Newland said.\n\nHistorians, scholars say it's too little, too late\n\nDakota historian and Indian education history expert Jeanne Eder Rhodes believes the effort could be too little, too late. Rhodes, a retired history professor and co-author of one of the first definitive books on the history of Indian education, said the damage boarding schools inflicted on tribes is \"so complicated that they really can't fix it.\"\n\nFor one thing, Rhodes said, the schools did such a good job of suppressing Indigenous languages that many tribes no longer have any living speakers, making revitalization difficult if not impossible. And, she said, larger tribes would most likely receive the lion's share of any funding, leaving smaller tribes out.\n\nRhodes also said she believes the report is \"reinventing the wheel,\" pointing to earlier such reports like the Meriam Report, which among other findings showcased the poor conditions in the schools, inadequate diet, including foods like milk to which Indigenous kids were allergic, and the difficulties Native students returning from boarding school faced as they were not prepared to reassume their lives in tribal communities.\n\nBecause her stepfather worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, she got a waiver to attend public schools. Still, she and other Native students suffered similar abuses to what boarding school students endured.\n\n\"There was a perception that Indian kids weren't capable of learning,\" Rhodes said.\n\nShe went on to earn a Ph.D in history from Washington State University.\n\nDavid Martinez, an Indian studies professor at Arizona State University, said the federal government \"should be held accountable for all people who suffered from the egregious boarding school policies whether or not they are in recognized tribes.\"\n\nMartinez is enrolled in the Gila River Indian Community but is also a member of the Hia-Ced O'odham Tribe, the only unrecognized tribe in Arizona.\n\nHe said there were no recognized tribes until 1934 when the Indian Reorganization Act was enacted, and that many students from currently non-recognized tribes were pulled into the schools.\n\n\"The worst abuses in Indian boarding schools occurred before 1934,\" Martinez said. \"Justice for non-federally recognized tribes is not based on when the abuses happened but on the fact that they happened at all.\"\n\nNewland said abuses occurred in the schools well into the 1960s and 1970s but the department is aware that many Native people living with the harmful effects of the schools don't live in their communities or are not members of recognized tribes. He also said the boarding schools may have had effects on federal recognition, particularly in Northern California.\n\n\"We've got to repair our relationship with all Indian people,\" Newland said.\n\nDebra Krol reports on Indigenous communities at the confluence of climate, culture and commerce in Arizona and the Intermountain West.

The initial report detailed for the first time an official list of Federal Indian boarding schools across to the United States, explained the policy justification the government used to establish those institutions, and detailed institutional conditions and the intergenerational impacts schools had on Indigenous People.\n\nNever miss Indian Country's biggest stories and breaking news. Click here to sign up to get our reporting sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning.\n\nToday's second volume of the investigation adds to previously-reported figures to paint an increasingly clearer picture of the Indian boarding school system: Between 1871 and 1969, the federal government paid more than $23.3 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars to fund the federal Indian boarding school system as well as other similar institutions. Of the 417 boarding schools across 37 states identified in the investigation, about half were run by a religious institution, and most \"used the manual labor of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children to compensate for the poor conditions of school facilities and lack of financial support from the U.S. Government.\"\n\nAt those schools, the investigation identified at least 18,624 students entered the system, and at least 973 students died while at school. The investigation also found that at least 74 school burial sites were associated with these institutions, though DOI expects that the number of students, student deaths, burial sites, and funds spent on the schools to be \"far greater.\"\n\nThe DOI also identified more than 1,000 federal and non-federal institutions that didn't fall under its definition of \"federal Indian boarding school\" but advanced the policy of assimilation. Those institutions -- including Indian day schools, sanitariums, asylums, orphanages, and stand-alone dormitories -- worked similarly to assimilate Native youth into white society.\n\n\"Make no mistake, this was a concerted attempt to eradicate 'the Indian problem,' -- to either assimilate or destroy Native peoples altogether,\" Interior Secretary Deb Haaland (Laguna Pueblo) said in a press briefing on Tuesday. \"Thankfully, the federal government failed. It failed to annihilate our languages, our traditions, our life ways. It failed to destroy us, because we are still here.\"\n\nThe Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative was launched by Interior Secretary Deb Haaland (Laguna Pueblo) in June 2021, with the goals of identifying boarding school locations, burial sites, and the names and tribal affiliations of children interred at each location.\n\nThe same month, Haaland announced the Road to Healing tour, a yearlong commitment to travel across Indian Country to collect oral histories from boarding school survivors and their descendants -- a task that concluded in November 2023, and took her and her staff to 12 communities.

The initial report detailed for the first time an official list of Federal Indian boarding schools across to the United States, explained the policy justification the government used to establish those institutions, and detailed institutional conditions and the intergenerational impacts schools had on Indigenous People.\n\nNever miss Indian Country's biggest stories and breaking news.

Native News Online E-Newsletters Native News Today Native News Health Desk\n\nToday's second volume of the investigation adds to previously-reported figures to paint an increasingly clearer picture of the Indian boarding school system: Between 1871 and 1969, the federal government paid more than $23.3 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars to fund the federal Indian boarding school system as well as other similar institutions. Of the 417 boarding schools across 37 states identified in the investigation, about half were run by a religious institution, and most \"used the manual labor of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children to compensate for the poor conditions of school facilities and lack of financial support from the U.S. Government.\"\n\nAt those schools, the investigation identified at least 18,624 students entered the system, and at least 973 students died while at school. The investigation also found that at least 74 school burial sites were associated with these institutions, though DOI expects that the number of students, student deaths, burial sites, and funds spent on the schools to be \"far greater.\"\n\nThe DOI also identified more than 1,000 federal and non-federal institutions that didn't fall under its definition of \"federal Indian boarding school\" but advanced the policy of assimilation. Those institutions -- including Indian day schools, sanitariums, asylums, orphanages, and stand-alone dormitories -- worked similarly to assimilate Native youth into white society.\n\n\"Make no mistake, this was a concerted attempt to eradicate 'the Indian problem,' -- to either assimilate or destroy Native peoples altogether,\" Interior Secretary Deb Haaland (Laguna Pueblo) said in a press briefing on Tuesday. \"Thankfully, the federal government failed. It failed to annihilate our languages, our traditions, our life ways. It failed to destroy us, because we are still here.\"\n\nThe Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative was launched by Interior Secretary Deb Haaland (Laguna Pueblo) in June 2021, with the goals of identifying boarding school locations, burial sites, and the names and tribal affiliations of children interred at each location.\n\nThe same month, Haaland announced the Road to Healing tour, a yearlong commitment to travel across Indian Country to collect oral histories from boarding school survivors and their descendants -- a task that concluded in November 2023, and took her and her staff to 12 communities. Much of that testimony was incorporated into Newland's most recent report, where he drew themes from survivors' testimonies, including the weaponization of food, the generational impacts across families, and the loss of language and culture leading to a spiritual wounding.\n\n\"One of the most prominent shared experiences of survivors across the country was the grief and trauma that resulted from Native languages loss from the Federal Indian boarding school system,\" the report reads. \"The punishments for speaking Native languages instead of English, even when children could not understand or speak English, commonly involved their mouths being washed with lye soap or varying types of corporal punishment that ranged in severity.\"\n\nAccording to the DOI, the federal Indian boarding school investigations \"lay the groundwork for the continued work of the Interior Department to address the intergenerational trauma created by historical federal Indian boarding school policies.\" To complete the full investigation, DOI staff and contractors reviewed approximately 103 million pages of U.S. Government records.\n\nIn his final report, Newland made eight recommendations for steps forward, including: for the U.S. government to formally apologize for the legacy of Indian boarding schools;\n\nfederal investment in the present-day harms caused by boarding schools; the erection of a national monument to commemorate boarding school survivors, and those who lost their lives; to identify and repatriate children who never came home from boarding school; and for the government to strengthen international relationships with nations who have similar histories with their Indigenous Peoples.\n\nIn his opening letter to Haaland, Newland acknowledges that Indian Country has seen a change in America's understanding of Indian Boarding schools in the last three years.\n\n\"Survivors and leaders have begun efforts to explain the legacy and impacts of Indian boarding schools on local communities across Indian country,\" he wrote. \"Universities and other institutions have begun their own actions to redress for [sic] their role in the Federal Indian boarding school system. Popular books, television shows, and films have discussed these institutions, and humanized this history for wide audiences. Courts and members of Congress have engaged in a dialogue on the policies and laws advanced by this system.\"\n\nNewland wrote that he hopes the report does not mark the end of the U.S. Government's work to acknowledge, understand, and heal from the impacts of these boarding schools.\n\n\"Instead, our shared work should mark the beginning of a long effort to heal our nation - after all, these schools were used to pursue a policy of forced assimilation over a century and a half,\" he wrote. \"Our work has occurred over just three years.\"\n\nMore Stories Like ThisInterior Secretary Deb Haaland Tests Positive for COVID-19\n\nTribal Chief Ben Elected to MDAH Board of Trustees\n\nNative News Weekly (July 28, 2024): D.C.

Nearly 900 known deaths occurred in the 417 federal-run institutions, along with uncounted cases of trauma, abuse, neglect, poor nutrition and despair. Entire generations paid the price for a failed federal policy.\n\nThese and other facts punctuated the second report on the troubled legacy of Indian boarding school policies and the federal government's attempt to assimilate tribes by removing children as young as age 4 to military-style schools.\n\nBut it was the personal accounts that stood out Tuesday in the second and final volume of a groundbreaking report on the toll the federal Indian boarding schools exacted on tribal communities, families and children.\n\n\"I think the worst part of it was at night, listening to all the other children crying themselves to sleep, crying for their parents, and just wanting to go home,\" one former student said.\n\n\"My aunt said after we all left, after the planes came and we all left, she said the village was so quiet because there was no children. No children in the village,\" another student from Alaska told a panel convened to hear from boarding students and their families.\n\nInterior Secretary Deb Haaland released the report Tuesday, following up on the first from 2022. This one contained more accurate information about how federal assimilation policies, including boarding schools and the wholesale removal of children handed off for adoption by non-Native families, caused havoc and disruption in Indigenous communities throughout the U.S.\n\nHaaland launched the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative in 2021 to investigate and document the \"troubled legacy\" of how the 417 federal schools and another 1,025 religious and privately operated schools worked to assimilate Indian children by removing them from their homes to sometimes remote military-style schools where they were systemically deprived of language, culture and family life.\n\n\"We're here because our ancestors persisted,\" Haaland said during a call with reporters Tuesday. \"It's our duty to share those stories with the world.\"\n\nThe Interior Department's team identified 417 Federal schools operating on 451 sites across 37 states or then-territories, including 22 schools in Alaska and 7 schools in Hawaii, between 1819 and 1969. The report found that religious organizations operated nearly half of the 417 federal schools, while another 59 schools run by religious groups received federal dollars.\n\nBryan Newland, assistant secretary for Indian Affairs, said investigators also identified 1,025 other institutions that were not run by the federal government but by religious organizations.\n\nThe report also provided detailed profiles on the federal institutions, Newland said.\n\nInvestigators pored through 103 million pages of records to locate at least 18,624 Indian, Alaska Native and Hawaiian children who were taken into the federal Indian boarding school system between 1819 and 1969, but they admitted the numbers are not complete.\n\nFor one thing, the report noted, children in the system outside of the study period would not be counted. Also, records from non-federal religious or private schools were not available. Other schools like day schools, sanitariums, asylums, orphanages, stand-alone dormitories and schools operated without government support also were not counted.\n\nThe report also estimated that more than $23.3 billion in fiscal year 2023 inflation-adjusted dollars were appropriated from 1871 to 1969 to run the schools and similar institutions and associated policies.\n\nThe report identified 973 children who died while attending one of the federal boarding schools. That number included 249 students from Arizona tribes. The three largest tribes in Arizona suffered the greatest losses. The Navajo Nation lost 135 children plus one from the Ramah Navajo Reservation in New Mexico; the four Apache tribes in Arizona suffered 49 deaths; and the O'odham tribes lost 41 students.\n\nThose figures are also likely far less than the number of children who perished. Some burial sites contain human remains of multiple people or burials of people relocated from other sites. This prevents tribes from the ability to identify those individuals.\n\nThe report also identified schools with onsite and offsite burial sites. The Phoenix Indian School, which operated from 1891 to 1990, did not have an onsite cemetery to inter the estimated 23 children who perished there.\n\nStudents, their families and entire communities have endured disruption from the boarding school system for nearly 200 years, the report said. Tribes are dealing with domestic violence, substance abuse and adverse childhood experiences often resulting in reduced cognitive abilities through adulthood, along with other social ills.\n\nThose effects include the government's next failed tribal assimilation policy: the wholesale removal of Indian children to be adopted into non-Native families. That policy persisted until 1978 with the enactment of the Indian Child Welfare Act, although Native kids are still removed from homes at greater rates than other groups.\n\nA price paid: Native families welcome children home, but 'long road' not over for others\n\nThe boarding school initiative included hearing the experiences of boarding school survivors and their families about the school experience and how it affected their lives and those of their descendants during \"The Road to Healing,\" a series of listening sessions across the U.S.\n\n\"We listened, we wept and we began to heal,\" Haaland said.\n\nThe Interior Department held one of those sessions in the Gila River Indian Community in 2023.\n\nThe report includes eight recommendations for the federal government from Assistant Secretary Newland that aim to support a path to healing the nation, including:\n\nAn oral history project launched in 2023 will continue to collect and make public boarding school students' experiences. The National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, which has been recording boarding school survivors' accounts and advocating for support services, will receive $3.7 million in grant funding to help facilitate this project.\n\nNewland and Haaland also said that language revitalization was one of the most-asked-for points during the 12-stop \"Road to Healing\" tour. Haaland said the departments of Education, Health and Human Services and Interior were developing a 10-year strategy to promote language revivals in tribal communities.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has supported the generation of the report, Haaland said, and she expects him to read it. She believes Biden and First Lady Jill Biden support language revitalization efforts.\n\n\"President Biden has made many promises and kept many promises to Indian County,\" Haaland said.\n\nNewland said families and students have also been calling for community-based, trauma-informed healing care, family-strengthening programs and reductions in Native kids being pulled into foster care, and programs to address domestic violence to deal with the intergenerational effects of the schools and other federal policies.\n\n\"There's a lot of work to be done to turn these broad recommendations into specific strategies,\" Newland said.\n\nDakota historian and Indian education history expert Jeanne Eder Rhodes believes the effort could be too little, too late. Rhodes, a retired history professor and co-author of one of the first definitive books on the history of Indian education, said the damage boarding schools inflicted on tribes is \"so complicated that they really can't fix it.\"\n\nFor one thing, Rhodes said, the schools did such a good job of suppressing Indigenous languages that many tribes no longer have any living speakers, making revitalization difficult if not impossible. And, she said, larger tribes would most likely receive the lion's share of any funding, leaving smaller tribes out.\n\nRhodes also said she believes the report is \"reinventing the wheel,\" pointing to earlier such reports like the Meriam Report, which among other findings showcased the poor conditions in the schools, inadequate diet, including foods like milk to which Indigenous kids were allergic, and the difficulties Native students returning from boarding school faced as they were not prepared to reassume their lives in tribal communities.\n\nBecause her stepfather worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, she got a waiver to attend public schools. Still, she and other Native students suffered similar abuses to what boarding school students endured.\n\n\"There was a perception that Indian kids weren't capable of learning,\" Rhodes said.\n\nShe went on to earn a Ph.D in history from Washington State University.\n\nDavid Martinez, an Indian studies professor at Arizona State University, said the federal government \"should be held accountable for all people who suffered from the egregious boarding school policies whether or not they are in recognized tribes.\"\n\nMartinez is enrolled in the Gila River Indian Community but is also a member of the Hia-Ced O'odham Tribe, the only unrecognized tribe in Arizona.\n\nHe said there were no recognized tribes until 1934 when the Indian Reorganization Act was enacted, and that many students from currently non-recognized tribes were pulled into the schools.\n\n\"The worst abuses in Indian boarding schools occurred before 1934,\" Martinez said. \"Justice for non-federally recognized tribes is not based on when the abuses happened but on the fact that they happened at all.\"\n\nNewland said abuses occurred in the schools well into the 1960s and 1970s but the department is aware that many Native people living with the harmful effects of the schools don't live in their communities or are not members of recognized tribes. He also said the boarding schools may have had effects on federal recognition, particularly in Northern California.\n\n\"We've got to repair our relationship with all Indian people,\" Newland said.\n\nDebra Krol reports on Indigenous communities at the confluence of climate, culture and commerce in Arizona and the Intermountain West.

The Interior Department also called for billions in federal funding to begin a \"healing\" process.\n\nThe report concludes a three-year investigation that saw, for the first time, the federal government accepting responsibility for its role in creating the system, which included more than 400 schools across 37 states.\n\n\"The federal government - facilitated by the Department I lead - took deliberate and strategic actions through federal Indian boarding school policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures and connections that are foundational to Native people,\" Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement.\n\nThe report calculates that the federal government spent the equivalent of $23 billion in today's dollars on the boarding school system from 1871 to 1969, and calls for spending an equivalent amount toward rebuilding families and communities.\n\nAmong the proposed initiatives are a national memorial to \"acknowledge and commemorate\" the experiences of tribes, and a plan to return the land on which the boarding schools were located to government or tribal ownership.\n\nThe new report expands upon the previously acknowledged size and scope of the system, adding more schools and burial grounds to the administration's final portrait of the gruesome system, and including oral histories that detailed decades of abuse and maltreatment.\n\nFor the past two years, Haaland and staff from the Interior Department have visited tribal communities around the country, hearing from survivors and their families.\n\n\"As we have learned over the past three years, these institutions are not just part of our past,\" said Bryan Newland, assistant secretary of Indian affairs. \"Their legacy reaches us today, and is reflected in the wounds people continue to experience in communities across the United States.\"\n\nAt the same time, the department continued its investigation, headed by Newland, of government records to compile an accurate record of the toll from the schools' practices. The final report increased the number of boarding schools in the U.S. from 408 to 417, across 37 states or then-territories. The number includes 22 schools in Alaska and seven in Hawaii.\n\nAnd the report confirms that at least 973 American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children died while attending schools in the system. The Department acknowledges that the actual number of children who died while attending Indian boarding schools is likely greater.\n\n\"This report further proves what Indigenous peoples across the country have known for generations: That federal policies were set out to break us, obtain our territories, and destroy our cultures and our lifeways,\" Newland, a member of the Bay Mills Indian Community, said in a statement,\n\nThe investigation also confirms that there are at least 74 marked or unmarked burial sites at 65 of the schools. One initiative proposed in the report is to identify and repatriate the remains of children who never returned home from the schools.\n\nIn the opening letter of the report, Newland says: \"The most important thing is that our work to tell the truth about the Federal Indian boarding school system be paired with action.\"\n\nThe final report seeks to put a price on that action, arguing that the government could begin to remedy the trauma inflicted in over a century of forced assimilation by investing \"on a scale, that is, at a minimum, commensurate with the investments made in the Federal Indian boarding school system between 1871 and 1969.\"\n\nIn other words, investing $23.3 billion back to the tribes, spread out over a long period of time. The report advocates spending on programs such as family reunification, language revitalization, and Indian education - programs intended to address the ways in which the boarding school system wreaked havoc on tribal communities.\n\nA national memorial to acknowledge the harm to tribes and individuals is one part of the proposed plans. It would serve not only tribal members, the report says, but would also help educate the broader population about the dark time in the country's history.\n\nCarlisle Indian Industrial School\n\nCarlisle was home to the Carlisle Indian Industrial School which was founded in 1879 and operated until 1918.\n\nDuring that time, over 10,000 indigenous children attended the school, including Olympian Jim Thorpe.\n\nAccording to records, the Carlisle Barracks Post Cemetery has 229 burial plots, 180 of which are identified as Native American burials. Of 180 Native Americans buried in the cemetery -most of whom are students who died while at the school - 157 have a name and tribal affiliation, and 23 are unknown. The Carlisle Indian Industrial School was founded by General Richard Henry Pratt, whose primary objective was to \"kill the Indian\" to \"save the Man.\"\n\nThe Carlisle Indian Cemetery was established in 1880 in an existing army burial ground in the school's campus, according to the Carlisle Indian School Digital Resource Center. Due to new construction and expansion of the campus at the time, the entire cemetery was moved to its present location in 1927.\n\nIn recent years, the United States Army has been collaborating with Indian\n\nTribes, Alaska Native Villages, and descendants regarding the 180 human child remains\n\nburied at the Carlisle Barracks Main Post Cemetery consistent with specific Tribal\n\npractices for disinterment, continued safeguarding of child remains at the cemetery, or\n\nheadstone modification.", "source": {"uri": "witf.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WITF"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

It calls on the federal government to formally acknowledge and apologize for its national policy of forced assimilation of Indigenous children and invest in programs to address the still-present effects of the boarding school era.\n\n\"Native American history is American history, and everyone must know this history,\" Haaland said. \"It is history that has shaped our nation and that, for too long, has been swept under the rug, all while Indigenous communities grapple with the undeniable fallout of intergenerational trauma.\"\n\nThe second volume of the report introduces a new version of New Mexico's map, dotted with blue circles.\n\nEach dot represents what was once an Indian boarding school site. There are 46 of them, concentrated in the northwest corner of the state but stretching as far south as Mescalero.\n\nA cluster of dots marks Santa Fe on the map, representing Ramona Indian School, St. Catherine Indian School and previous iterations of Santa Fe Indian School and the Institute of American Indian Arts, which are now tribally controlled and congressionally chartered, respectively.\n\nHaaland said telling the story of the federal Indian boarding school system has remained a \"top priority\" for her since taking office in 2021.\n\nThe first volume of the report described the conditions children experienced -- including physical, sexual and emotional abuse -- after the U.S. government established Indian boarding schools across the country with the purpose of assimilation and the suppression of Indigenous languages and beliefs.\n\nHaaland also embarked on \"The Road to Healing,\" a years-long tour across the U.S. during which Indigenous people could share their experiences with the boarding school system and which included stop at Isleta Pueblo in October 2023.\n\nThe second volume expands on that work, said Newland, a citizen of the Bay Mills Indian Community in Michigan.\n\nIt updates the official list of Indian boarding schools, which now totals 417 institutions across 37 states or then-territories, and provides detailed profiles of each.\n\nIt confirms at least 973 Indigenous children died while attending the schools and documents 74 marked and unmarked burial sites across the campuses.\n\nIt estimates the U.S. government spent more than $23.3 billion in fiscal year 2023 dollars between 1871 and 1969 to operate the federal Indian boarding school system and similar institutions.\n\n\"Make no mistake, this was a concerted attempt to eradicate [the] 'Indian Problem,' to either assimilate or destroy Native peoples altogether,\" Haaland said of the system of federal Indian boarding schools.\n\n\"Thankfully, the federal government failed,\" she added. \"It failed to annihilate our languages, our traditions, our lifeways. It failed to destroy us because we are still here.\"\n\nIn the latest volume of the report, Newland recommended a series of policy changes to redress the lasting harms of forced assimilation for modern-day Indigenous communities.\n\nFirst on the list of recommendations: An apology from the federal government for the harm it caused to individuals, families and tribes through the boarding school system.\n\n\"All three branches of our federal government were involved in carrying out this policy, and it's really important that an apology reflect the will of the entire country and the United States government,\" Newland said during Tuesday's news conference.\n\nHaaland added that the initiative has the \"full support\" of President Joe Biden, and she anticipates possible conversations about the report's second volume with the White House.\n\nNewland also recommended the federal government invest in programs -- including community- and culturally-based healing, family reunification, violence prevention, education and Indigenous language revitalization -- to correct some of the harms caused assimilationist policies.\n\n\"We must bring every resource to bear to restore what they set out to destroy,\" Newland said.\n\nThe second recommends ongoing efforts at memorialization and research. It encourages the construction of a national memorial; the return of former Indian boarding school sites to tribes and children's remains to families; and the sharing of stories.\n\nIt also implores the federal government to expand research into the long-term physical, emotional, parenting and population effects of the federal Indian boarding school system while strengthening international relationships with other countries confronting similar histories, such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\"It is my sincere hope that this report does not mark the end of our work to acknowledge, understand and heal from the effects of these boarding schools,\" Newland said. \"Instead, our shared work should mark the beginning of a long effort to heal our nation.\"", "source":

Department of Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a member of the Pueblo and Laguna tribes in New Mexico, launched the initiative in 2021. The department published the first volume in 2022.\n\n\"I am immensely proud of the hundreds of Interior employees -- many of them Indigenous -- who gave of their time and themselves to ensure that this investigation was thoroughly completed to provide an accurate and honest picture,\" Haaland said Tuesday in a news release.\n\nFrom the 1800s through the 1960s, federal assimilation policies resulted in the removal of thousands of Native American children from their homes to be educated in boarding schools.

This one contained more accurate information about how federal assimilation policies, including boarding schools and the wholesale removal of children handed off for adoption by non-Native families, caused havoc and disruption in Indigenous communities throughout the U.S.\n\nReport updates profiles of Chemawa Indian Training School, other schools\n\nTen schools in Oregon that fit the definition of federal Indian boarding schools used for the report were identified.\n\nAmong them is Chemawa Indian Training School in Salem. It is the oldest continuously operated and federally run Indian boarding school in the United States. The report does not detail practices or information about Chemawa but an updated profile of each school said the DOI identified 53 students who died while enrolled at the school between 1819 and 1969.\n\nThe report identified 15 \"other institutions\" that operated in the state: Burns Day School, Celilo School, Hot Creek Day School, Indian Manual Labor Training School (aka Willamette University), Klamath Agency Day School Nos. 1-4, Mission Bottom Manual Labor Training School. Modoc Point Day School, St. Ann Mission School, St. Joseph's Academy, Tutuilla Day School, Umpqua Day School, and Upper Farm Day School.\n\nThe list notes an onsite marked burial site at the Chemawa Cemetery and the former Forest Grove Indian Industrial Training School. The report noted that the number of deceased students does not necessarily represent those buried at a school. The Chemawa Cemetery was established a year after the school was moved from Forest Grove to its current location in 1886.\n\nSuAnn Reddick, a former volunteer Chemawa historian, published a website in 2022 with Eva Guggemos, associate professor at Pacific University, representing 25 years of research to compile a list of names of those buried at the site.\n\nAccording to their research, 270 students died in the custody of the Forest Grove Indian Industrial Training School and Chemawa Indian Training School between 1880 and 1945. Some 50 student remains are unaccounted for, according to their research.\n\nThe names and burial locations of students that Reddick and Guggemos identified as students who died in the custody of the schools and a map of both cemeteries are listed on the website.\n\n\"Our goal is that this study may honor the children, reveal the truth, reunite families and help the healing,\" Reddick wrote in a statement on the site.\n\nFederal Indian boarding schools examined\n\nHaaland launched the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative in 2021 to investigate and document the \"troubled legacy\" of how the 417 federal schools and another 1,025 religious and privately operated schools worked to assimilate Indian children by removing them from their homes to sometimes remote military-style schools where they were systemically deprived of language, culture and family life.\n\n\"We're here because our ancestors persisted,\" Haaland said during a call with reporters Tuesday. \"It's our duty to share those stories with the world.\"\n\nThe Interior Department's team identified 417 Federal schools operating on 451 sites across 37 states or then-territories, including 22 schools in Alaska and 7 schools in Hawaii, between 1819 and 1969. The report found that religious organizations operated nearly half of the 417 federal schools, while another 59 schools run by religious groups received federal dollars.\n\nBryan Newland, assistant secretary for Indian Affairs, said investigators also identified 1,025 other institutions that were not run by the federal government but by religious organizations.\n\nThe report also provided detailed profiles on the federal institutions, Newland said.\n\nInvestigators pored through 103 million pages of records to locate at least 18,624 Indian, Alaska Native and Hawaiian children who were taken into the federal Indian boarding school system between 1819 and 1969, but they admitted the numbers are not complete.\n\nFor one thing, the report noted, children in the system outside of the study period would not be counted. Also, records from non-federal religious or private schools were not available. Other schools like day schools, sanitariums, asylums, orphanages, stand-alone dormitories and schools operated without government support also were not counted.\n\nThe report also estimated that more than $23.3 billion in fiscal year 2023 inflation-adjusted dollars were appropriated from 1871 to 1969 to run the schools and similar institutions and associated policies.\n\nDeaths at boarding schools are likely underreported\n\nThe report identified 973 children who died while attending one of the federal boarding schools.\n\nThose figures are also likely far less than the number of children who perished. Some burial sites contain human remains of multiple people or burials of people relocated from other sites. This prevents tribes from the ability to identify those individuals.\n\nThe report also identified schools with onsite and offsite burial sites.\n\nStudents, their families and entire communities have endured disruption from the boarding school system for nearly 200 years, the report said. Tribes are dealing with domestic violence, substance abuse and adverse childhood experiences often resulting in reduced cognitive abilities through adulthood, along with other social ills.\n\nThose effects include the government's next failed tribal assimilation policy: the wholesale removal of Indian children to be adopted into non-Native families. That policy persisted until 1978 with the enactment of the Indian Child Welfare Act, although Native kids are still removed from homes at greater rates than other groups.\n\nWhat's next in 'The Road to Healing'\n\nThe boarding school initiative included hearing the experiences of boarding school survivors and their families about the school experience and how it affected their lives and those of their descendants during \"The Road to Healing,\" a series of listening sessions across the U.S.\n\n\"We listened, we wept and we began to heal,\" Haaland said.\n\nThe report includes eight recommendations for the federal government from Assistant Secretary Newland that aim to support a path to healing the nation, including:\n\nAn oral history project launched in 2023 will continue to collect and make public boarding school students' experiences. The National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, which has been recording boarding school survivors' accounts and advocating for support services, will receive $3.7 million in grant funding to help facilitate this project.\n\nNewland and Haaland also said that language revitalization was one of the most-asked-for points during the 12-stop \"Road to Healing\" tour. Haaland said the departments of Education, Health and Human Services and Interior were developing a 10-year strategy to promote language revivals in tribal communities.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has supported the generation of the report, Haaland said, and she expects him to read it. She believes Biden and First Lady Jill Biden support language revitalization efforts.\n\n\"President Biden has made many promises and kept many promises to Indian County,\" Haaland said.\n\nNewland said families and students have also been calling for community-based, trauma-informed healing care, family-strengthening programs and reductions in Native kids being pulled into foster care, and programs to address domestic violence to deal with the intergenerational effects of the schools and other federal policies.\n\n\"There's a lot of work to be done to turn these broad recommendations into specific strategies,\" Newland said.\n\nHistorians, scholars say it's too little, too late\n\nDakota historian and Indian education history expert Jeanne Eder Rhodes believes the effort could be too little, too late. Rhodes, a retired history professor and co-author of one of the first definitive books on the history of Indian education, said the damage boarding schools inflicted on tribes is \"so complicated that they really can't fix it.\"\n\nFor one thing, Rhodes said, the schools did such a good job of suppressing Indigenous languages that many tribes no longer have any living speakers, making revitalization difficult if not impossible. And, she said, larger tribes would most likely receive the lion's share of any funding, leaving smaller tribes out.\n\nRhodes also said she believes the report is \"reinventing the wheel,\" pointing to earlier such reports like the Meriam Report, which among other findings showcased the poor conditions in the schools, inadequate diet, including foods like milk to which Indigenous kids were allergic, and the difficulties Native students returning from boarding school faced as they were not prepared to reassume their lives in tribal communities.\n\nBecause her stepfather worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, she got a waiver to attend public schools. Still, she and other Native students suffered similar abuses to what boarding school students endured.\n\n\"There was a perception that Indian kids weren't capable of learning,\" Rhodes said.\n\nShe went on to earn a Ph.D in history from Washington State University.\n\nDavid Martinez, an Indian studies professor at Arizona State University, said the federal government \"should be held accountable for all people who suffered from the egregious boarding school policies whether or not they are in recognized tribes.\"\n\nMartinez is enrolled in the Gila River Indian Community but is also a member of the Hia-Ced O'odham Tribe, the only unrecognized tribe in Arizona.\n\nHe said there were no recognized tribes until 1934 when the Indian Reorganization Act was enacted, and that many students from currently non-recognized tribes were pulled into the schools.\n\n\"The worst abuses in Indian boarding schools occurred before 1934,\" Martinez said. \"Justice for non-federally recognized tribes is not based on when the abuses happened but on the fact that they happened at all.\"\n\nNewland said abuses occurred in the schools well into the 1960s and 1970s but the department is aware that many Native people living with the harmful effects of the schools don't live in their communities or are not members of recognized tribes. He also said the boarding schools may have had effects on federal recognition, particularly in Northern California.\n\n\"We've got to repair our relationship with all Indian people,\" Newland said.\n\nDianne Lugo covers the Oregon Legislature and equity issues.

The report calls for the U.S. government to apologize for the 150-year-long forced assimilation policy designed to separate children from their families and obliterate tribal identity.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of the Interior study, many of the deceased children were buried at 65 former schools across the nation, in at least 74 marked and unmarked burial sites.

The report also details the extent of physical and sexual abuse endured by the children, who were stripped of their names and forbidden from speaking their native languages. Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs, Bryan Newland, emphasized that federal policies aimed to dismantle tribal cultures and seize territories.\n\nThe department identified 18,624 Indian children who attended the Federal Indian Boarding School system, although many more are believed to have been enrolled.

Text accompanying the photo identifies the students as \"orphans.\" (Federal Boarding School Initiative Investigative Report Vol. II / Princeton University Library)\n\nThe U.S. legacy of genocide against Native people through public education may never be completely told.\n\nToday, there is a little more truth to share.\n\nThe second half of an investigative report was released Tuesday as part of the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative led by the Department of the Interior. It's another step in acknowledging, learning and potentially healing from harms the U.S. government caused people from every Indigenous nation in the country through federal school programs between 1819 and 1969.\n\nIn the update to the report commissioned in 2021, the Interior Department estimates that more than $23.3 billion was appropriated by Congress to run an education system that forced at least 18,624 children from tribes across the country to schools where they were assaulted, forced to labor and assimilated until their entire culture was destroyed.\n\nThe report, which acknowledges that all of this new data remains incomplete, states that 973 children died in that period.\n\nResearchers do not go into detail on students at boarding schools past 1969 or before 1819.\n\nAn additional 11 federal Indian boarding schools were identified. This brings the total number of schools to 417.\n\nThe review also updates how many religious institutions were involved with the federal government in carrying out the education assimilation plan. The Catholic Church (80) and Protestant religion (134) were the most active in operating the schools. Four additional schools run by non-sectarian Missionary, Unitarian Church, the United Brethren in Christ and an \"independent\" denomination are also listed.\n\nBetween 1819 and 1969, the federal Indian Boarding School system operated in 37 states and territories.\n\nBased on information found in the investigation, the federal government said it can identify the name and tribal affiliation for the 18,624 children, some of whom are at 74 marked and unmarked graves across 64 school sites.\n\nThe Interior Department does not give specific locations and said it is working with tribal nations on how they want to return any person from these boarding school gravesites.\n\nIn New Mexico, 46 schools operated in the central and Four Corners regions of the state from 1819 to 1969. Only 32 of the many students at the Albuquerque Indian School during that time were identified.\n\nTen of the students who died in Albuquerque were identified. The report lists an unmarked grave and a marked grave for the school. In 2021, federal boarding school officials conducted a ground radar review of remains under a city park that was once part of the school.\n\nThe city of Albuquerque committed a section of the park for a memorial. That has yet to happen.\n\nThe Interior Department investigation identified 725 students who attended Santa Fe Indian School between 1819 and 1969, including 34 students that died.\n\nProfiles for each school are listed for the public to view. Leading its disclaimer on the information, authors write, \"The content of this document may be disturbing or distressing. The information in it is subject to change or revision.\"\n\nNo such schools operated in Maine from 1819 to 1969, according to the report. However, the report identifies four students from the Wabanaki Confederacy -- one each from the Passamaquoddy Tribe and Penobscot Nation, three identified as Wabanaki -- who attended schools during that time.\n\nEight recommendations for moving forward are listed, including community support for mental health treatment, a national memorial, returning land to tribes where boarding school sites are located, and establishing investments that could be modeled after repatriation work for First Nations harmed by Canada's boarding school policies.\n\nLauren McCauley contributed to this report.",

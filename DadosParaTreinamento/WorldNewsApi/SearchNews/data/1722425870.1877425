The sportscaster said at the time that the treatment had \"taken its toll on my voice\" and would focus on \"healing.\" \"I had such expectations when I learned that the 35 radiation treatments wiped out the cancer on my vocal cords. However due to the cancer & intense radiation it created other problems on my vocal cords,\" he explained in a November 2023 post on X.

Doom: The Dark Ages is a medieval spin on the Doom franchise, taking the Doom Slayer back to the beginning. It\u2019s coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one, sometime in 2025. Microsoft\u2019s first trailer for Doom: The Dark Ages shows the frenetic, precision gameplay we\u2019ve come to expect from the franchise \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of blasting and shooting and a chainsaw. Oh, and the Doom Slayer can ride a dragon? Sunday\u2019s announcement is the first official news of Doom: The Dark Ages, following an Insider Gaming report from May. Bethesda Softworks and id Software released Doom Eternal in 2020. Launching alongside Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Doom Eternal was a major hit. The game sold three million digital copies in its release month, according to sales numbers from Superdata. That\u2019s three times the number of copies 2016\u2019s Doom sold in its first month, per GamesIndustry.biz. id Software released two pieces of DLC for Doom Eternal: The Ancient Gods: Part One and The Ancient Gods: Part Two. In 2021, ahead of The Ancient Gods: Part Two, Doom Eternal game director Hugo Martin spoke to Polygon about the future of the series \u2014 perhaps hinting at the medieval setting: \u201cCould we tell a story about when [the Doom Slayer] first came to that place with the Sentinels, almost like a more medieval setting, a fantasy setting?\u201d Martin said. \u201cI think as you play the DLC, too, you\u2019ll see lots of hints of what we could do moving forward. Maybe even in the future. Again, our hero is somewhat timeless \u2014 I mean, literally, he\u2019s immortal. So we could tell all kinds of stories.\u201d", "url": "https://www.polygon.com/24171213/doom-dark-ages-microsoft-xbox-games-showcase-sequel", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2shuS1hsWV1VOU5adMZXkWmdDVU=/0x38:1920x1043/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25484043/vlcsnap_2024_06_09_13h07m29s191.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:13:18", "author": "Nicole Carpenter", "authors": ["Nicole Carpenter"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.212}

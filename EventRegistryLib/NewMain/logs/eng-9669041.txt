He stated that Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 had developed \"certain attitudes and gestures which he must respond to\" and that he will have the opportunity to defend himself.\n\nReporting from the same event, the Italian news agency ANSA quoted the cardinal as saying that it is \"normal that the (Dicastery for the) Doctrine of the Faith has taken the situation into its own hands and is carrying out the necessary investigations to examine this situation in depth.\"\n\n\"I always appreciated him as a hard worker who was very loyal to the Holy See, in a sense also an example; he worked extremely well when he was an apostolic nuncio.

has continued to be vocal about his opposition to Pope Francis and Vatican II.\n\nFor example, in a 2020 letter written by Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 and published on Inside the Vatican, the archbishop said \"it is undeniable that from Vatican II onwards a parallel church was built, superimposed over and diametrically opposed to the true Church of Christ.\"\n\nArchbishop Vigan\u00f2 also wrote in a post on X in November 2023 that Pope Francis' \"incompatibility\" with the function of the papacy \"confirms his defect of consent in the assumption of the Papacy,\" but he specified that his comments should not be taken to mean he shares the opinion of sedevacantists.\n\nReacting to the letter he received from the dicastery about the trial, the archbishop wrote, \"I regard the accusations against me as an honor.\" The accusation against him issued for questioning both the legitimacy of Pope Francis and the Second Vatican Council confirms that the \"synodal church\" promoted by the pope is the metastasis of the \"ideological, theological, moral, and liturgical cancer\" of Vatican II, he wrote in a blog post published June 20.\n\nHe went on to write that he does not want \"any ecclesial communion\" with the pope or his collaborators but claimed that he remains \"in full communion with the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church\" and the magisterium of the popes.\n\nThe Code of Canon Law defines schism as \"the refusal of submission to the Supreme Pontiff or of communion with the members of the Church subject to him.\"", "source": {"uri": "catholicregister.org", "dataType": "news",

He has become a popular figure among some U.S. conservatives due to his support for former President Donald Trump and opposition to the acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community in the church, as Pope Francis has sought to make the church more inclusive.\n\nPope Francis has been viewed as more liberal on some social issues than his predecessors and faced criticism from more conservative Catholics over his public comments supporting priests blessing same-sex couples, support for immigrants and efforts to combat climate change.\n\nOn Thursday, Vigan\u00f2 wrote that he is being tried for schism. He was summoned to the Palace of the Holy Office either in person or represented by a lawyer, according to a letter he uploaded online that appeared to notify him of the summons. The letter included a signature from John Joseph Kennedy, a secretary of the disciplinary section.\n\nSchism is defined as a formal division in or separation from a church or religious body. According to that letter, he has been charged with denying the legitimacy of Pope Francis, having broken communion with him and rejecting the Second Vatican Council.\n\nIn an open letter that Vigan\u00f2 penned about the trial, he described it as an \"extrajudicial process.\"\n\nThe Vatican has not confirmed that Vigan\u00f2 is being tried or commented on his accusations. Newsweek reached out to the Vatican and Vigan\u00f2 for comment via email.\n\nHe said he views the accusations against him as an \"honor\" in the letter posted to his website, in which he struck a defiant tone against Pope Francis' leadership. He said the charges confirm \"the theses that I have repeatedly defended in my various addresses.\"\n\n\"No Catholic worthy of the name can be in communion with this 'Bergoglian church,' because it acts in clear discontinuity and rupture with all the Popes of history and with the Church of Christ,\" he wrote.\n\nHe wrote that he believes Catholics must question whether \"it is consistent with the profession of the Catholic Faith to passively witness the systematic destruction of the Church by its leaders, just as other subversives are destroying civil society.\"\n\nPope Francis \"goes beyond his role in matters that strictly pertain to science, he wrote.\n\n\"But always and only in one direction: a direction that is diametrically opposed to what the Church has always taught,\" he wrote.\n\nIn January, Vigan\u00f2 said Pope Francis should be arrested over a controversy surrounding a book written by a cardinal about sexuality in 1998. In 2020, he called for a \"mass exorcism\" over the COVID-19 pandemic. He opposed shutting down church services to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nThe archbishop previously served as a Vatican ambassador to the U.S. for five years; he was appointed as Apostolic Nuncio in 2011 and remained in post until his retirement in 2016.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_stanton@newsweek.com", "name": "Andrew Stanton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Schism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Maria_Vigan\u00f2", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditionalist_Catholicism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Traditionalist Catholicism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_the_Holy_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palace of the Holy Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Vatican_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second Vatican Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Now, after receiving years of withering verbal attacks, Francis appears to have struck back against Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2, the former Vatican ambassador to the United States and the pope's most ardent internal critic.\n\nThe Vatican's disciplinary body, the Dicastery of the Doctrine of the Faith, issued a formal decree, made public by Vigan\u00f2 on Thursday, assigning the senior cleric to a penal canon trial. The charges: the \"crime of schism\" and \"denial of the legitimacy of Pope Francis.\"\n\nSuch trials are exceedingly rare, and the move underscores a recent effort by the Vatican to take more formal action against a gaggle of archconservatives who have sought to undermine Francis's papacy from the inside. Conviction could lead to Vigan\u00f2's defrocking and excommunication. It would end the long career of the 83-year-old Italian cleric who has emerged as the leading symbol of a traditionalist resistance to a papacy perceived by him as wildly liberal.\n\nOn Thursday, Vigan\u00f2 said in a statement that he saw the \"accusations against me as an honor.\" He referred to Francis as he always does, eschewing his official title and using his name before he was pope: Jorge Mario Bergoglio.\n\n\"It is no coincidence that the accusation against me concerns the questioning of the legitimacy of Jorge Mario Bergoglio and ... the ideological, theological, moral, and liturgical cancer of which the Bergoglian 'synodal church' is the necessary metastasis,\" Vigan\u00f2 wrote.\n\nVigan\u00f2 hasn't made many public appearances since calling for Francis's resignation in 2018. But he has continued to deliver stinging missives on X and the conservative U.S. outlet LifeSiteNews. He has also talked about creating a seminary free of Vatican interference.\n\nFrancis has for years tolerated open dissent, including vitriolic attacks from within clerical ranks. But as criticism has grown louder in recent months, the Vatican has taken more decisive action. Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Tex. was stripped of his diocese, while American Cardinal Raymond Burke, who frequently spoke at conservative conferences that excoriated Francis, lost his pension and Rome apartment.\n\nIt's possible that the most severe punishment has been reserved for Vigan\u00f2.\n\nHe was ordered to appear at the Vatican's disciplinary office on Thursday and told that he would be tried in absentia if he didn't, according to document advising him of the charges. It was not clear if he had presented himself after publicly signaling his defiance.\n\nOn Thursday, that Vatican's secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin told journalist in Rome that \"Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 has taken some attitudes and some actions for which he must answer.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry because I always appreciated him as a great worker, very faithful to the Holy See, someone who was, in a certain sense, also an example. When he was apostolic nuncio he did good work.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Schism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Maria_Vigan\u00f2", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicastery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dicastery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canon law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pontiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditionalist_Catholicism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Traditionalist Catholicism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defrocking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defrocking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synod", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Synod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excommunication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Excommunication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liturgy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liturgy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LifeSiteNews", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LifeSiteNews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_in_absentia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trial in absentia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Papal diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Leo_Burke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raymond Leo Burke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Parolin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pietro Parolin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diocese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archbishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seminary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Opposing Views", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://thumb.spokesman.com/Am_a8cCmwrj0AHKywVIhpSX_gt4=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2024/06/20/66749754c5f8d.hires.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669041", "eventUri": "eng-9669041", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

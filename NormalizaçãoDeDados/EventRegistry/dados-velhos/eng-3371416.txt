Alvarado had to survive several rocky moments early on as Siqueira came out guns-a-blazing in the first three rounds.\n\nAlvarado went down in the third but it was correctly ruled a slip. Alvarado started to come on in the fourth with his uppercut finding a home. An uppercut had Siqueira hurt midway through the round and then a huge right hand put Siqueira down with his head bouncing off the canvas.\n\nThe TKO will be in the running for Knockout of the Year. The former super lightweight titlist has now won 4 fights in a row. The time of the stoppage was 1:20.\n\nLocal favorite Steve Nelson (9-0) kept his perfect record intact with a hard fought unanimous decision victory over a game Cesar Ruiz (5-6) in their light heavyweight bout. Ruiz was signifcantly smaller than Nelson but kept charging forward throughout the fight. Nelson pitched a shutout 60-54 on all three scorecards but had to work hard in only his second bout that has gone the distance in his 9 fight career.\n\nFormer heavyweight title challenger Bryant Jennings (20-2) returned to the ring with a TKO victory over Daniel Martz (15-4-1). The fight was Jennings' Top Rank debut after a two and a half year layoff. Jennings started off fast while Martz was already fading in the first round. Martz went down three times in the second with the referee waiving the bout off after the third knockdown. A combination of punches sent Martz to the canvas for the final time at the 2:18 mark of the second round.\n\nIn the first bout of the evening, heavyweight contender Dillian Whyte (21-1) entered the ring for the first time since his December victory over Dereck Chisora that was a 2016 Fight of the Year candidate. The Matchroom promoted fighter won his first fight on US soil, stopping Malcolm Tann (24-6) in 3 rounds. A right left two-punch combination to the body sent Tann down for a fourth and final time. The official time of the stoppage was 2:36.\n\nTags: Mike Alvarado", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T00:54:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8941176533699036, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374997", "time": "00:54:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3371416", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "215468", "label": {"eng": "Lincoln"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lincoln"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "315824", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "score": 3}, {"id": "327224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "score": 3}, {"id": "332133", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Light heavyweight"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_heavyweight", "score": 3}, {"id": "347124", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Light welterweight"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_welterweight", "score": 3}, {"id": "348069", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Unanimous decision"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimous_decision", "score": 3}, {"id": "350926", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Top Rank"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Rank", "score": 2}, {"id": "506139", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Technical knockout"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout#Technical_knockout", "score": 3}, {"id": "520655", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Uppercut"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppercut", "score": 4}, {"id": "696736", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mike Alvarado"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Alvarado", "score": 4}, {"id": "710726", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Dereck Chisora"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dereck_Chisora", "score": 1}, {"id": "743881", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bryant Jennings"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryant_Jennings", "score": 2}, {"id": "1284138", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Dillian Whyte"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dillian_Whyte", "score": 2}, {"id": "1334956", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Ring magazine Knockout of the Year"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ring_magazine_Knockout_of_the_Year", "score": 3}], "image": "http://photo.boxingscene.com/uploads/mike-alvarado%20(2)_5.jpg", "timeCrawl": "00:54:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Mike Alvarado With a Wicked Knockout of Sidney Siqueira", "originalArticle": null}

Whoever emerges victorious will become just the third member of the highly exclusive club, and the first since Taylor in 2005.\n\nIndongo is a revved up Ferrari who has produced wins against top fighters.

Here, we break down the fight and what you can expect.\n\nThis Saturday night, ESPN presents their latest Top Rank card as Terence Crawford (31-0; 22 KO) faces Julius Indongo (22-0; 11 KO). The fight is for Crawford's WBO, WBC, and Ring titles, and Indongo's IBF and WBA titles - meaning the winner here will unify the division and be the undisputed king at 140 pounds. Ring Magazine puts Indongo as the division's #2 contender, with divisional champion Crawford also sitting at #4 on their pound for pound list. The fight will air live on ESPN this Saturday, August 19 with a fight time of 10:00 p.m. ET, with prelims airing online at ESPN3 starting at 6:30.\n\nHow do these two stack up?\n\nCrawford: 29 years old | 5'8\" | 70\" reach | switches stance\n\nIndongo: 34 years old | 5'10\" | 71\" reach | southpaw stance\n\nWhat have these two done recently?\n\nCrawford: W - Felix Diaz (RTD) | W - John Molina, Jr. (TKO) | W - Viktor Postol (UD)\n\nIndongo: W - Ricky Burns (UD) | W - Eduard Toyanovsky (KO) | W - Fabian Lyimo (TKO)\n\nHow did these two get here?\n\nTerence Crawford really burst onto the scene in 2014, winning Fighter of the Year and Fight of the Year accolades on many cards. He became the lineal king at 135 pounds, then stepped up to 140 where he's become the top dog and now looks to cement that position by unifying all the titles - an insanely rare feat in modern boxing. Crawford is an excellent technical boxer, but he's also a bit of a brawler, which makes him a thrilling fighter to watch at times. He has often brought his fights to his highly vocal hometown fans in Nebraska - this fight takes place in Lincoln.\n\nJulius Indongo was virtually unknown a year ago. Indongo represented Namibia at the 2008 Olympics, turning pro the next year. He went 20-0 fighting exclusively in Namibia against African boxers. Then, last December, Eduard Troyanovsky brought him to Russia to be an opponent for a routine title defense. Indongo knocked him out in 40 seconds. In April, Ricky Burns thought he could take the title Indongo claimed from Troyanovsky and unify it with his own - Indongo dominated him in a clear decision win. It's been an amazing year for him, and it culminates here.\n\nWhat can fans expect?\n\nWhat makes Terence Crawford so very good is that high level technique combined with a genuine desire to rough his opponent up in there. He tends to start a bit slow, but is ready to pick up the pace when needed. And when he does, he's vicious, beating opponents down into submission. Indongo has showed that he is capable of ending the night quickly, and just as capable of controlling over 12 rounds. But there's no way he rolls over Crawford here like he did his last two opponents. To win this, he'll have to show that he can survive a war, because the man that finally beats Crawford is going to take a heck of a beating himself in the process. It's so hard to get a read on Indongo to know if he has that in him. Gut instinct is no - but I fully recognize that Indongo has made a year out of defying expectations. It would be an incredible story if he pulled this off, but I don't see it.\n\nPrediction: Terence Crawford, KO9\n\nWhy should you watch?\n\nIt's one of the best in the world taking on a solid challenge and making history in the process. Indongo is enough of a wild card that there should be some intrigue to this one - I'm incredibly excited to see how it plays out.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T17:30:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 673, "textStart": 664, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-19", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.8470588326454163, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3371416", "time": "17:30:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3371416", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "160", "label": {"eng": "Namibia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Namibia"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "191", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "303320", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "score": 3}, {"id": "305867", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "score": 5}, {"id": "310322", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Organization", "score": 3}, {"id": "310327", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "score": 5}, {"id": "321554", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Federation"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Federation", "score": 3}, {"id": "331116", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Terence Crawford"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Crawford", "score": 5}, {"id": "344754", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Ring (magazine)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ring_(magazine)", "score": 3}, {"id": "348143", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Association"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Association", "score": 3}, {"id": "350921", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Council"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Council", "score": 3}, {"id": "350926", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Top Rank"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Rank", "score": 4}, {"id": "358406", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Lineal championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineal_championship", "score": 3}, {"id": "388958", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "ESPN3"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN3", "score": 3}, {"id": "467775", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Southpaw stance"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southpaw_stance", "score": 3}, {"id": "538089", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Undisputed champion"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_Champion", "score": 4}, {"id": "606760", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ricky Burns"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Burns", "score": 3}, {"id": "1303381", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Eduard Troyanovsky"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Troyanovsky", "score": 2}, {"id": "1303387", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Julius Indongo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Indongo", "score": 5}, {"id": "1310238", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Viktor Postol"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Postol", "score": 3}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AVuEx5_OhuQYtDk5ApRNvqkmEqg=/0x0:3505x1972/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56268437/686144322.0.jpg", "timeCrawl": "18:35:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Breakdown: Terence Crawford vs. Julius Indongo fight preview and prediction", "originalArticle": null}

Not only did he knock out Troyanovsky in 40 seconds of round one, but he scored a candidate for 'Knockout of the Year.'\n\nOver four months later, Indongo pulled off another victory, defeating Ricky Burns to capture the WBA title in Glasgow, Burns' hometown.\n\nCan he pull off a trifecta by defeating the best junior welterweight in the world tonight in Terence Crawford? With what he has accomplished and overcoming a difficult upbringing, do not count him out.\n\nIndongo will put up his WBA and IBF world title belts tonight when he faces Crawford in a 12 round unification bout at the Pinnacle Bank Arena in Lincoln, Nebraska. The fight will headline a three-bout 'Top Rank on ESPN' broadcast, beginning at 10 p.m. ET/ 7 p.m. PT.\n\nCrawford's WBC and WBO world titles will be on the line.\n\nIndongo (22-0, with 11 KOs) may be 34 years of age, but he is at the apex of his career. The 2008 Olympian from Namibia, a country located in southwestern portion of Africa, did not have the luxuries some amateurs have early on.\n\n\"I began boxing when I was 11 years of age after listening to fights on the radio,\" Indongo told Boxingscene.com recently. \"We didn't have hand wraps when I first started. It was only when I had my first amateur fight years later did I have wraps.\"\n\nIndongo would make his pro debut almost a year after the conclusion of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. He would mostly fight at a country club resort in the capital of Windhoek, but there were occurrences he would fight in small halls throughout the country.\n\nHis purses were small considering the high six-figure purse he is receiving Saturday night.\n\nIndongo, who met Crawford for the first time on Aug. 4, never imagined the path his career would take over the last year or so.\n\n\"It never crossed my mind. Being from Africa, I did not have the access to some of the top promoters in the world. It was not easy to get to this point. It was a very fortunate situation for me to get these opportunities.\"\n\nThat is not to say Indongo had thoughts he would one day face Crawford.\n\n\"I've followed Crawford's style. It is an interesting style that he has and that's why I've followed and studied him over the last couple of years. He's a very good fighter. He does his best when he is on the inside. That's where he's the most dangerous.\"\n\nWhile Indongo remains the underdog against Crawford, a win over the fighter from Omaha would mean everything for Indongo.\n\n\"A victory would be very historic in my country. I don't know if I would receive any special treatment, but defeating Crawford would be a significant accomplishment.\"\n\nFrancisco A.

A win for Terence Crawford would help raise his profile for bigger fights down the line. Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images/AFP\n\nLOS ANGELES, USA - Namibia's Julius Indongo has no qualms about taking his quest for super lightweight supremacy into hostile territory - against American Terence Crawford in Lincoln, Nebraska, on Saturday, August 19 (Sunday Manila time).\n\nAfter all, he seized Ricky Burns's World Boxing Association title with a convincing unanimous decision in Glasgow in April, adding it to the International Boxing Federation belt he grabbed with a first-round knockout of Eduard Troyanovsky on December 3 in Moscow.\n\nIndongo, 22-0 with 11 knockouts, knows he's still unfamiliar to most in America - something he can change quickly with a victory over 31-0 Crawford - who puts his own World Boxing Council and World Boxing Organization titles on the line.\n\n\"I believe this is the time for me to show the world that a boxer from Africa, from Namibia, can beat a guy fighting in his home in front of his people,\" Indongo said. \"This is the best way to do it.\n\n\"I am confident in my styles and techniques that I have learned from years ago ... I am not sure if there is going to be a knockout - but I know I can do that if I have to.\"\n\nBut Indongo is a decided underdog against Crawford, whose hand speed and power are enhanced by an ability to switch smoothly from southpaw to orthodox.\n\nThe 29-year-old American is coming off back-to-back victories inside the distance, over John Molina Jr. and Felix Diaz, and has won five of his last 6 bouts inside the distance.\n\n\"If he defeats me, everyone expects it,\" Indongo said. \"But the guy in Moscow was dangerous, too.\n\n\"I'm just thankful for the opportunity. Terence is a very clean fighter. The ring will tell. I know he can switch (stance). I (hit) to the body. I look with my eyes and see. I know how to deal with things. I will handle it.\"\n\nCrawford admitted it wasn't Indongo he expected to be facing with all 4 major world titles on the line.\n\n\"We never heard of Indongo and we never saw him fight other than the fight he had in Russia,\" Crawford said.\n\n\"We wanted the Troyanovsky fight but he decided to go with Indongo so when we heard that he got knocked out, we looked at the replay and looked at the fight - that's when we first took notice of who Indongo really was.\"\n\nEven then, Crawford's camp was eyeing a Burns fight - before Indongo beat him, too.\n\n\"That's when we took notice and said well, he's the guy with the other two titles, so let's see if we can make a fight with him and unify.\"\n\nWhile Crawford recognizes that Indongo is \"a good boxer\" with a dangerous punch, he was looking toward the bout with confidence.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T02:14:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 362, "textStart": 353, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-19", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 638, "textStart": 628, "date": "-12-03", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.8196078538894653, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3371416", "time": "02:14:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3371416", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "160", "label": {"eng": "Namibia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Namibia"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "191", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "12949", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "62003", "label": {"eng": "City of Manila"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "City of Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "88694", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "215468", "label": {"eng": "Lincoln"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lincoln"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "303320", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "score": 3}, {"id": "303539", "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 3}, {"id": "305090", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "score": 4}, {"id": "310322", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Organization", "score": 3}, {"id": "310327", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "score": 5}, {"id": "321554", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Federation"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Federation", "score": 3}, {"id": "331116", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Terence Crawford"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Crawford", "score": 5}, {"id": "347124", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Light welterweight"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_welterweight", "score": 3}, {"id": "348143", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Association"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Association", "score": 3}, {"id": "350921", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Council"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Council", "score": 3}, {"id": "606760", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ricky Burns"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Burns", "score": 3}, {"id": "615073", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John John Molina"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_John_Molina", "score": 2}, {"id": "732850", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Danish straits"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_straits", "score": 4}, {"id": "1303381", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Eduard Troyanovsky"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Troyanovsky", "score": 3}, {"id": "1303387", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Julius Indongo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Indongo", "score": 3}], "image": "https://assets.rappler.com/612F469A6EA84F6BAE882D2B94A4B421/img/751730A0273043128820A1DD88D118F1/063_512782976.jpg", "timeCrawl": "02:14:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Crawford, Indongo duel for junior welterweight supremacy", "originalArticle": null}

He added the WBO strap to his WBC/WBA/IBF trifecta. He kept all four belts for one fight, losing to Jermain Taylor in 2005.\n\nTaylor couldn't keep all the belts together long enough for the Hopkins rematch.\n\nThe winner on Saturday (ESPN, 10 PM EST/7 PM PST) will be the first male fighter since Taylor to hold all four belts simultaneously and they may not do it long. In another era, the possibility of four mandatories in a calendar year might be feasible.\n\nThis isn't another era.\n\nIt won't matter. Entering the fight, Terence Crawford is already perceived in many circles as the rightful champion at Jr. welterweight. Whoever exits the ring with their hand raised will have eliminated any doubt.\n\nIn this division, there will truly be only one champion.\n\nLet's go to the report card.\n\nThe Ledgers\n\nTerence Crawford\n\nAge: 29\n\nTitle: Lineal/TBRB/Ring/WBC World Jr. Welterweight (2016-Present, 2 Defenses); WBO light welterweight (2015-Present, 5 Defenses)\n\nPrevious Titles: WBO lightweight (2014-15, 2 Defenses); Lineal/TBRB/Ring lightweight (2014-15)\n\nHeight: 5'8\n\nWeight: 140 lbs.\n\nHails from: Omaha, Nebraska\n\nRecord: 31-0, 22 KO\n\nRecord in Major Title Fights: 9-0, 6 KO\n\nCurrent/Former World Champions/Titlists Faced: Ricky Burns UD12; Yuriorkis Gamboa TKO9; Viktor Postol UD12\n\nVs.\n\nJulius Indongo\n\nAge: 34\n\nTitle: IBF light welterweight (2016-Present, 1 Defense); WBA super lightweight (2017-Present, 1st Attempted Defense); IBO super lightweight (2016-2017, 1 Defense).\n\nPrevious Titles: None\n\nHeight: 5'10 \u00bd\n\nWeight: 139 lbs.\n\nHails from: Windhoek, Namibia\n\nRecord: 22-0, 11 KO?\n\nRecord in Major Title Fights: 2-0, 1 KO\n\nCurrent/Former World Champions/Titlists Faced: Eduard Troyanovsky KO1; Ricky Burns UD12\n\nGrades\n\nPre-Fight: Speed - Crawford A; Indongo B+\n\nPre-Fight: Power - Crawford B+; Indongo B\n\nPre-Fight: Defense - Crawford A-; Indongo B+\n\nPre-Fight: Intangibles - Crawford A; Indongo A\n\nIndongo's path to this fight is a testament to striking when the iron is hot and having the character to embrace a moment. Saturday he goes on the road to the other man's home turf for the third straight fight. Each of the last two times, he left with a belt. If he wins this weekend, the only belts left will have to come in another division.\n\nHow can Indongo pull off his third big road win in a row? For the Namibian, it will start with using his physical strengths. He has rare height and length for his class and uses them well. His jab is snappy, he works it smartly to the head and body, and it says here his grade may be too low for speed. Crawford appears just a hair quicker, and more fluid in motion, but if Indongo finds his rhythm it might not matter.\n\nIndongo's jab could wreak havoc on the shorter man if Crawford struggles to get past it early. The sometimes over extended, and sometimes arching, left hand of Indongo could give Crawford countering opportunities. Another avenue to will come by way of body attack. Crawford is an excellent body puncher. It's one element of a fighter who isn't just crafty.\n\nCrawford comes across as downright mean sometimes.\n\nThere is a chip on his shoulder. Inside the ring, it's an endearing trait.\n\nHe fought Felix Diaz in his last fight almost exclusively southpaw just because he could.\n\nAnd he whupped Diaz good.\n\nIn Indongo he faces a southpaw again and Crawford's ability to fight from any stance could help to keep Indongo off balance. While Indongo is a feel good story heading in, Crawford is a sizable step up from the last two champions he's faced in Troyanovsky and Burns.\n\nSo far, both men have shown solid beards and neither has been shy when the lights got brighter. Crawford performs as well at home as he does anywhere else and Indongo's two biggest wins came on the road. In terms of intangibles, what we know about both men so far is strongly positive.\n\nThe Pick\n\nAlso, so far, the man we know more about is Crawford. It's hard not to have some small voice in the back of the head almost pulling for Indongo. This guy has gone from Russia, to Glasgow, and now to Nebraska in three straight fights. If he wins this one, it's one of the best stories in boxing in the last few years.\n\nIt's just hard to see how he writes that last chapter. Indongo does a lot of things well. He doesn't appear to do as many things well as Crawford. Crawford can fight going in any direction and appears the more dangerous puncher on a consistent basis. One can envision a scenario where Indongo finds the right range, keeps Crawford pinned down, and fights tall for enough rounds to win the fight.\n\nThe more likely outcome is Crawford solves the height and reach and begins to time a more predictable attack from his opponent. The pick is Crawford.\n\nReport Card Picks 2017: 26-12\n\nCliff Rold is the Managing Editor of BoxingScene, a founding member of the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board, and a member of the Boxing Writers Association of America.

In the 1930s, the middleweight and flyweight titles had a slew of claimants to the world title. Everyone was making enough money that holding off on ultimate 'unification' took about a decade to complete.\n\nMoney is the root of it after all.\n\nMost of the fighters who hold belts aren't worried about losing a boxing match. They're worried about losing a check. If you're a Strawweight champion making five figures for a title fight, that's a hell of a lot better place to be than the strawweights without a belt. Risking a title against another champion makes it harder to make a living. It only makes sense if it pays well more than defending often in front of a paying home court until a dangerous mandatory comes along.\n\nIt's not very sporting but, for most of the beltholders in boxing, it's rational.\n\nThey made the risk worth the reward for the fighter with more to lose this weekend.\n\nTo be sure, both Julius Indongo and Terence Crawford have a lot on the line. Each holds two of the four most recognized sanctioning body titles. They stand to have the largest audience of their respective careers on ESPN (10 PM EST/7 PM PST) with solid fight week coverage to get the word out.\n\nUnlike Crawford (31-0, 22 KO), an American fighter with an established base of fans in Nebraska and lots of US TV exposure, Indongo (22-0, 11 KO) likely has less chance to rebound if he loses this weekend. Indongo is already 34 and, for most American fans, unknown even with his WBA and IBF belts.\n\nIndongo might have been able to milk those belts for a while and spread out the paydays. Instead, he's trying to finish a gutsy road trip trifecta.\n\nNamibia's Indongo went to Russia and knocked out Russia's Eduard Troyanovsky (26-1, 23 KO) last year for the IBF strap. He went to Glasgow to beat Scotland's Ricky Burns for the WBA strap.\n\nNow he's in Lincoln Nebraska trying to go from invisible man to undisputed champion in three fights.\n\nLose memorably and there could be other days for Indongo. Lose wide and he may be forgotten as quickly as he emerged. Indongo is gambling big on himself and deserves credit for it.\n\nCrawford merits plenty of credit too. The WBC, WBO, and lineal champ is a talented fighter on the cusp of the real high dollar promised land. Indongo is the sort of guy a man in his position might not normally want to mess with. Indongo is longer, taller, and has shown the pressure of being the away team does not stifle him.\n\nThe risk for Crawford isn't that a loss could make him anonymous. For Crawford, the risk is that a loss could provide a long-term rationale for fighters to avoid him and cut off his avenues to the biggest fights that could be made.\n\nHe is, in some sense, where the late Vernon Forrest found himself in 2003. After two wins over \"Sugar\" Shane Mosley, Forrest was the lineal welterweight champion and the consensus 2002 Fighter of the Year. He could begin to realistically dream about chasing the golden goose of his era: Oscar De La Hoya. All he had to do was keep winning and hope public pressure and consistent victory opened a door down the road.\n\nForrest opted for a unification clash with wild swinging, big talking Ricardo Mayorga. The odds were heavily in Forrest's favor.\n\nMayorga stopped him in three and then won a decision in the immediate rematch.\n\nForrest was far from done. HBO and Showtime still had room for him and he added two reigns at Jr. middleweight. It was a hell of a career.\n\nIt just never quite landed on the jackpot fight.\n\nCrawford has won recognition from both Ring and TBRB as the rightful champion at lightweight and Jr. welterweight. He's already had a hell of a career but the true riches lay just a little farther away. This might be the absolute worst time to lose he could find.\n\nIt's what makes this a fight to be excited about. While both men are getting a reported seven figures, that's not the sort of sum after taxes that puts one in a safe zone for life. They're getting good money in the hopes of great money somewhere down the line.\n\nThey're also fighting to do something only one other fighter has done.\n\nSince the WBO came into existence in the late 1980s, only two fighters have held all four major belts simultaneously: Bernard Hopkins who unified the middleweight crown and Jermain Taylor who took it from him. The winner Saturday will be the third.\n\nUnification was never easy. In the four-belt era, it's so difficult almost no one even bothers to try.\n\nCrawford and Indongo are both bothering. Who will find their risk rewarded?\n\nCliff Rold is the Managing Editor of BoxingScene, a founding member of the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board, and a member of the Boxing Writers Association of America.

Whyte knocked Tann down 4 times in the fight in putting him down 2 times in round and another 2 times in round 3. The fight was quickly halted by referee Tom Anderson. The official time of the stoppage was at 2:36 of round 3.\n\nThe Whyte-Tann fight was streamed on the ESPN app. for the boxing fans that downloaded it.\n\nWhyte came into the bout at a career high of 260 lbs. AAs bad as Tann looked, Whyte probably could have come in even heavier if he had wanted to. Tann was no match at all for the big shots from Whyte.\n\nWhyte's promoter Eddie Hearn wants to get him an immediate title shot against WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder if possible. Hearn has already made Wilder an offer. We'll see if Hearn can get that fight put together. Whyte said this week that he'd like to fight WBO heavyweight champion Joseph Parker if he defeats #1 challenger Hughie Fury in their fight on September 23. That would be a big fight between Whyte and Parker if a deal can be made.\n\nThe ultimate end goal for the 29-year-old Whyte is a rematch against IBF/WBA heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua, who stopped him in the 7th round in 2015. Whyte vs. Joshua brought in big numbers on Sky Box Office at the time. If Whyte can win a heavyweight world title before he faces Joshua, their fight would be even bigger. Whyte gave Johua all he could handle in hurting him in the 2nd round before suffering a shoulder injury that limited his effectiveness for the remainder of the fight. Whyte staggered Joshua in the 2nd round. It was surprising. The injury for Whyte was a lucky break for Joshua because he might have lost the fight if Whyte had continued to punch the way he was.\n\nBryant Jennings vs. Daniel Martz results\n\nMaking his first appearance in 20 months, former heavyweight title challenger Bryant Jennings (20-2, 11 KOs) obliterated Daniel Martz (15-5-1, 12 KOs) in scoring a 2nd round TKO. Jennings, 32, knocked the 26-year-old Maltz down 3 times in round 2 before the fight was stopped by the referee Paul Perry. The official time of the stoppage was at 2:18 of round 2.\n\nJennings picked up his first win since 2014. He had lost his last 2 fights to Luis Ortiz and former heavyweight world champion Wladimir Klitschko in 2015. Jennings' last win was a controversial 12 round split decision victory over Mike Perez on July 26, 2014. There are many boxing fans that thought Perez should have won that fight.\n\nThe 32-yer-old Jennings could be getting a heavyweight title shot soon against WBO champion Joseph Parker. Jennings' new promoters at Top Rank want to get him a title shot after one more fight if possible. It would be a great comeback story for Jennings.\n\nMike Alvarado vs. Sidney Siqueira results\n\nFormer WBO light welterweight champion Mike \"Mile High\" Alvarado (38-4, 25 KOs) scored a brutal one-punch knockout in round 4 to defeat 40-year-old Brazilian journeyman Sidney Siqueira (26-13-1, 17 KOs) in a scheduled 10 round fight. Alvarado caught Siqueira with a perfect right hand to the head in the 4th round that flattened him on the canvas. Siqueira was badly hurt and it was clear that he was not going to get up from that knockdown in time to beat the count.\n\nThe fight was a back and forth war with neither guy showing much in the way of defense. The 37-year-old Alvarado started coming on in the 3rd round in nailing Siqueira with tremendous shots. Siqueira was catching Alvarado with haymaker punches. There were a number of times in the fight where it looked like Alvarado might get stopped He was getting hit way too much for his own good, and he looked very sloppy. It was not the performance you'd like to see from a former world champion fighting a 40-year-old journeyman. Alvarado made Siqueira look good.\n\nIt's kind of troubling how hard of a time Alvarado had in beating Siqueira. He made this fight a lot tougher than it should have been by failing to block the wide shots the Brazilian Siqueira was throwing at him.\n\nAlvarado didn't look as good as he was 4 years ago when he was in his prime, beating the likes of Brandon Rios, Mauricio Herrera and Briedis Prescott. Alvarado is now fighting at welterweight, and his power isn't quite as devastating at this weight. He still has very excellent power nonetheless.\n\nThe win for Alvarado was his fourth consecutive victory since his 3rd round stoppage loss to Rios on January 24, 2015. Alvarado looks a lot better now than he was in that fight and in his losses to Juan Manuel Marquez and Ruslan Provodnikov. Alvarado went through a rough period during that part of his life in losing 4 out of 5 fights from 2012 to 2015. It looks like Alvarado has turned things around. The only way we can really know for sure is if Alvarado can beat one of the top fighters in the welterweight division. The way that Alvarado looked against Siqueira tonight, I have my doubts whether he can beat the top fighters at 147. He had a lot of problems with Siqueira. This should have been an easy fight for Alvarado, but it wasn't.\n\nIt's unclear where Alvarado goes from here. Is Top Rank trying to get Alvarado ranked high enough to get him a world title shot? I can't imagine Alvarado fighting for a world title with the way he looked tonight. I think he would get knocked out by any of the champions at 147 in a round or 2. He looked so bad tonight. The power is still there for Alvarado, but his defense is nonexistent. He can't get hit the way he was tonight if he wants to be able to be competitive against the champions at welterweight.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T01:26:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1316,

I am not sure if there is going to be a knockout - but I know I can do that if I have to.\"\n\nBut Indongo is a decided underdog against Crawford, whose hand speed and power are enhanced by an ability to switch smoothly from southpaw to orthodox.\n\nThe 29-year-old American is coming off back-to-back victories inside the distance, over John Molina Jr. and Felix Diaz, and has won five of his last six bouts inside the distance.\n\n\"If he defeats me, everyone expects it,\" Indongo said. \"But the guy in Moscow was dangerous, too.\n\n\"I'm just thankful for the opportunity. Terence is a very clean fighter. The ring will tell. I know he can switch (stance). I (hit) to the body. I look with my eyes and see. I know how to deal with things. I will handle it.\"\n\nCrawford admitted it wasn't Indongo he expected to be facing with all four major world titles on the line.\n\n\"We never heard of Indongo and we never saw him fight other than the fight he had in Russia,\" Crawford said.\n\n\"We wanted the Troyanovsky fight but he decided to go with Indongo so when we heard that he got knocked out, we looked at the replay and looked at the fight - that's when we first took notice of who Indongo really was.\"\n\nEven then, Crawford's camp was eyeing a Burns fight - before Indongo beat him, too.\n\n\"That's when we took notice and said well, he's the guy with the other two titles, so let's see if we can make a fight with him and unify.\"\n\nWhile Crawford recognizes that Indongo is \"a good boxer\" with a dangerous punch, he was looking toward the bout with confidence.\n\n\"I think I have been doing a lot in the sport of boxing and I have had my name mentioned in the top three,\" he said. \"I will be looking forward to being the top one, or maybe two, after this fight.\" -

Crawford's quick victory sent a capacity crowd of 12,121 into a frenzy at Pinnacle Bank Arena, about a 45-minute drive from Crawford's hometown of Omaha.\n\nThe previously unbeaten Indongo was writhing in pain, flat on his back, as referee Jack Reiss counted him out at 1:38 of the third round.\n\nCrawford defended his WBC and WBO super lightweight titles and added Indongo's IBF and WBA crowns to his collection in their rare full title unification fight. His easy victory Saturday night made Crawford the first fully unified boxing champion in any division since Jermain Taylor owned the IBF, WBA, WBC and WBO middleweight titles after defeating Bernard Hopkins by split decision in July 2005.\n\nCrawford joined Taylor and Hopkins as the only boxers to own four recognized titles simultaneiously since the WBO became a recognized sanctioning organization in the 1990s. The two-division champion also continued to make a strong case for recognition as the best boxer, pound-for-pound, in the sport.\n\nBefore finishing him, Crawford floored Indongo after landing a left hand to the side of Indongo's head with less than a minute to go in the second round. A stunned Indogo got up as Reiss' count reached eight and was able to survive until the bell sounded to signal the end of the second round.\n\nCrawford knocked Indongo off-balance with a short, counter right hook in the first round.\n\nTwo rounds later, Crawford ruined Indongo's incredible run over the past eight months from anonymous African contender to a world champion who made seven figures for their Saturday night.\n\nBefore falling to Crawford near his hometown, Indongo burst upon the international boxing scene by beating two world champions on their home turf in back-to-back bouts.\n\nIndongo needed just one punch and 40 seconds to knock off Russia's Eduard Troyanovsky (26-1, 23 KOs), then the IBF 140-pound champion, on December 3 in Moscow. He followed up that spectacular performance by soundly out-boxing Scotland's Ricky Burns (41-6-1, 14 KOs), who Indongo defeated by unanimous decision in their 12-rounder to win the WBA super lightweight championship April 15 in Glasgow.\n\nKeith Idec is a senior writer/columnist for BoxingScene.com.

(on ESPN).\n\n\"It means a lot to me being it will be the first time that all four belts will be on the line at one time in the division's history, and it has only been done twice in boxing,\" said Crawford, of Omaha, Neb. \"I'm just ready for the moment and fight time this weekend.\"\n\nEach fighter holds two belts, so both have plenty to win and plenty to lose. The difference is Indongo, of Namibia, Africa, will be fighting Crawford in what is essentially his backyard.\n\n\"I try and not say too much before the fight, which is something that I am used to,\" said Indongo, 34. \"I prefer to do it in the ring when my opponent is standing in front of me so I can do my work.\n\n\"I have been in boxing for a long time and not many people know me. I believe this is the time for me to show the world that a boxer from Africa, from Namibia, can beat a guy fighting in his home in front of his people. This is the best way to do it.\"\n\nThis is the kind of attitude we should love from a boxer trying to accomplish a terrific feat in the ring. Even Crawford seems to respect that.\n\n\"It shows a lot about his character and his confidence and his ability in the ring,\" said Crawford, 29. \"Him being a two-time world champion in that short amount of time shows that he has a lot of confidence. But at the same time, he is a little older so he's at the end of his career coming along, so he doesn't have a lot of choices for what he wants to do. He can't wait around.\"\n\nIndongo has only been a pro since 2009. He didn't win his first belt until he knocked out Eduard Troyanovsky this past December. Indongo won his second title when he took a unanimous decision from Ricky Burns in Burns' native Scotland this past April.\n\nCrawford (31-0, 22 KOs) admits he has seen little of Indongo (22-0, 11 KOs), but he speaks as if he knows this might not be a walk in the park.\n\n\"Indongo is a good fighter,\" Crawford said. \"He is a good boxer - he's got good legs and he seems like he can punch. He doesn't let his opponent get on the inside and do a lot of damage to him.\"\n\nHere's the thing - Indongo may be \"good,\" but Crawford has proven to be one of the top pound-for-pound fighters in the world, and the chances are he is going to walk away with all four belts.\n\nHowever, Indongo is pondering what it's going to be like when he takes them home.\n\n\"It's going to mean a lot to me - it will mean all of the hard work and determination got that achievement and it will create more opportunity for me,\" he said. \"I will travel the world with the four titles. I will take them back to Africa - to my country. I am going to be very, very happy.\"\n\nWe doubt that, but this could be a competitive fight.\n\nETC\n\nWe are one week out from the Aug. 26 junior middleweight fight between Floyd Mayweather Jr. (49-0, 26 KOs) and UFC star Conor McGregor of Ireland at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas (on Showtime pay-per-view).

All four light welterweight titles are on the line in Lincoln, Nebraska, as Terence Crawford and Julius Indongo strive to become the true number one in their weight division.\n\n31-0 across a nine-year professional career, Crawford has long been regarded as one of the greatest fighters on the planet. While many boxers typically have one, or if they're very lucky, two significant X-factors in their athletic arsenal, Crawford is simply excellent at everything.\n\nThe 29-year-old is fast with both hand and foot, has a consistent defence, plenty of power, the ability to seamlessly change tactics within a fight, and a disarming ability to beat an opponent at their own game. In short, he's special - and in victories over the likes of Viktor Postol, Thomas Dulorme and Ricky Burns, he has showed an exceptional ability to stay composed amidst great pressure.\n\nRead more Everything you need to know about Mayweather v McGregor\n\nCrawford was named the 2014 fighter of the year after a phenomenal 12 months where he became the best lightweight of his generation, and tonight he puts his WBC and WBO titles on the line against IBF and WBA champion Indongo, who at 34-years-old is experiencing an unexpectedly brilliant year.\n\nFew expected much of the unknown Indongo when he travelled to Russia last December to face Eduard Troyanovsky, but everyone knew who he was forty seconds into the bout when he knocked out the Russian favourite to win the IBF title. That was the first time Indongo had fought outside of Namibia, and the second time was in April when he travelled to Scotland to face Ricky Burns.\n\nOnce again facing a hostile crowd and a home world champion, Indongo simply got on with the job, and convincingly outpointed Burns en route to becoming a double world champion. Although the Namibian will once again be fighting in a rival's backyard tonight in Nebraska, it's hard to imagine that Indongo will feel anything other than supreme confidence. After all, he's done it twice before, and the third time's a charm right?\n\nJulius Indongo in action against Ricky Burn (Getty)\n\nIndongo's southpaw stance gave Burns plenty of problems in Glasgow, but Crawford is more than capable of dealing with awkward styles. The issue for the American is one of focus. Yes, the concept of becoming a unified champion is one few boxers can ever dream of, let alone achieve, but the rewards of victory could change his life forever.\n\nPotential fights against Errol Spence Jr and Manny Pacquiao have been mooted, but they will only occur if he defeats Indongo, which is something no man has ever achieved before. The bookmakers believe it's a done deal, however, with Crawford a huge 1/11 favourite. You can get rich betting on Indongo, with the African star 7/1 to win the fight via any method, and he has shown in the past that he has the power to upset the odds in the blink of an eye.\n\nThere is British interest on the undercard as Dillian Whyte fights Malcolm Tann on the undercard, while potential future opponent Bryant Jennings also competes against Daniel Martz.\n\nMore about: Terence

It will be televised Saturday on ESPN (10 p.m. ET) but the lead-up to the fight has been overshadowed by Mayweather-McGregor.\n\nThe undisputed part of this showdown is important to the sweet science because the winner - provided it does not end in a draw or no contest -- will become just the third man in boxing's four-belt era to be crowned undisputed champ. Bernard Hopkins became the undisputed middleweight champion when he defeated Oscar De La Hoya, now his business partner, in 2004. Ten months later, after defending the belts against Howard Eastman, Hopkins lost his titles in a split decision to Jermain Taylor, who remains the last fighter to hold all four major belts. He never defended all four in any fight, even in his rematch against Hopkins, which was again won by Taylor.\n\nIndongo was virtually unknown before he stunned undefeated Russian knockout artist Eduard Troyanovsky in Moscow with a first-round, first-minute knockout in December to win the IBF 140-pound title. It was the first time Indongo had fought outside of Namibia.\n\nHe then went to Glasgow, Scotland, in April to put his belt on the line against WBA champion Ricky Burns and came away with a fairly easy unanimous decision, setting up the unification bout with Crawford, whose team had wanted bouts with both Troyanofsky and Burns -- he won his lightweight title against Burns in 2014 -- before they chose Indongo instead.\n\n\"I have been in boxing for a long time and not many people know me,\" said the 34-year-old Indongo, who is promoted by Matchroom Boxing. \"I believe this is the time for me to show the world that a boxer from Africa, from Namibia, can beat a guy fighting in his home in front of his people. This is the best way to do it.\"\n\nSaturday's bout at sold-out Pinnacle Bank Arena and the victor's spoils loom large for Crawford, Top Rank's star, in his climb to the pinnacle of the 140-pound division and rise up the pound-for-pound ladder.\n\n\"It means a lot to me being it will be the first time that all four belts will be on the line at one time in the division's history and it has only been done twice in boxing,\" Crawford said. \"I'm just ready for the moment.\"\n\nCrawford knows little about Indongo, and in fact said he never heard of him before his fight against Troyanovsky. But he respects the road warrior for traveling to the champions' home country to face whoever will fight him.\n\n\"It shows a lot about his character and his confidence and his ability in the ring,\" Crawford said. \"Him being a two-time world champion in that short amount of time shows that he has a lot of confidence but at the same time he is a little older so he's at the end of his career coming along so he doesn't have a lot of choices. He can't wait around.\n\n\"He is a good boxer - he's got good legs and he seems like he can punch. He doesn't let his opponent get on the inside and do a lot of damage to him.\"\n\nCrawford, 29, who is ranked No. 4 pound-for-pound by Ring Magazine, believes winning the undisputed championship should vault him to No. 1 or No. 2.\n\n\"I think I have been doing a lot in the sport of boxing and I have had my name mentioned in the top three,\" he said. \"I will be looking forward to being the top one, or maybe two after this fight. It just depends on how people look at it. In my eyes I think I am top two already.\"\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T19:05:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 167, "textStart": 160, "imp": true, "date":

Crawford has two of the four major titles. He unified them 13 months ago in a one-sided decision, including two knockdowns, against then-undefeated Viktor Postol, who many thought would give him a competitive fight.\n\nBut Julius Indongo, who was unknown in December, also has two belts and harbors similar goals as Crawford. The 2008 Olympian from Namibia was perceived as a layup opponent when he traveled to Moscow to challenge titleholder Eduard Troyanovsky in December but scored a spectacular first-round upset knockout. Titleholder Ricky Burns' team made the same mistake by immediately offering Indongo a unification fight, so Indongo packed his bags again and traveled to Burns' home turf in Glasgow, Scotland. All he did was toy with Burns en route to a shutout decision to secure a second belt on April 15.\n\nWith Crawford, 29, still seeking to win the other titles, and Indongo, 34, looking for his biggest payday as well as the glory, and with no other major fight legitimately available to either, their camps made a deal and here we are -- a fight for the undisputed junior welterweight title on Saturday night at Pinnacle Bank Arena in Lincoln, Nebraska, a short drive from Crawford's hometown of Omaha.\n\n\"We are in boxing to fight the best there is and he has two title belts,\" Crawford said. \"For me it doesn't get any bigger than this.\"\n\nThe main card will air live on ESPN and ESPN Deportes beginning at 10 p.m. ET with the entire card streaming live on the ESPN app beginning at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n\nCrawford-Indongo will be only the fourth fight of the four-belt era in which all four major titles will be on the line in the same bout, and the winner will walk away as the undefeated, undisputed champion and the No. 1 fighter at 140 pounds.\n\n\"It means a lot to me being it's the first time all four belts have been on the line at one time in a long time,\" Crawford said. \"Only been done (three times) ever before. I am just ready for the moment and excited for the fight. This is what we do it for, to be called one of the best in the world, in the division. Why not shoot for greatness?\"\n\nThis is indeed a rare kind of fight. The last time -- the only other time -- there was a four-belt unification fight was in 2004, when then-middleweight champion Bernard Hopkins put his three belts up against Oscar De La Hoya's one and knocked him out to unify the 160-pound division.\n\nThere has only been two other fights in which all four titles were on the line, both in 2005 when Hopkins retained them by outpointing Howard Eastman and then lost them by decision in his first fight with Jermain Taylor. By the time Hopkins and Taylor met in an immediate rematch, politics intervened and Taylor had been stripped of a belt for electing to fight Hopkins again instead of making a far-less significant and lucrative mandatory defense.\n\n\"I want him to unify and make history and the 140-pound division,\" Crawford's trainer and co-manager Brian McIntyre said. \"We can also silence all of the critics that have been saying that his resume is not as good as some fighters. Not only me, but also the whole entire team is excited. I know he is excited too, to get out there and show ESPN what everybody has been hearing -- that he is a great boxer and a damn good puncher.\"\n\nSaid Crawford: \"It means a lot being that you're the only champion that can be called champion in the division. I look at this fight as one of the biggest of my career because of everything that's at stake -- all the belts, history, the type of fighter he is, everything.\"\n\nIndongo said he is focusing more on winning the fight. Then he said he'll enjoy the hardware.\n\n\"My view of this is that I have not focused much on that since I have been busy in the gym,\" he said. \"I have not focused on anything but making sure of my performance on Saturday night. My focus has been in the gym to make sure my game will be the best ever. No one will ever forget about this fight. The organizations were involved in making this fight happen and I appreciate that but I won't think much about having four titles until the fight is over.\n\n\"(But having all four belts is) going to mean a lot to me. It will mean all of the hard work and determination got that achievement and it will create more opportunity for me. I will travel the world with the four titles. I will take them back to Africa (and) to my country. I am going to be very, very happy.\"\n\nOne of the reasons why four-belt unification fights are so rare -- and three-belt bouts are not common either -- is because the sanctioning organizations often work against them. Each has their own way of doing things and own mandatory title fights.\n\nBut Top Rank and Indongo co-promoter Eddie Hearn of Matchroom Boxing worked hard to get each organization on the same page to make the fight possible.\n\n\"It was very difficult,\" Top Rank president Todd duBoef said. \"We had to work hand-in-hand with Matchroom because obviously Matchroom and Indongo had two belts and Top Rank and Crawford had two belts, and there were mandatories and everything that was coming into play. There were people that we had to appeal to and we said, 'Hey, this is a rare opportunity that we are able to do this. Let's try and work together and have a positive solution for the sport of boxing,' and I think we delicately managed it.\"\n\nThat said, it is unlikely that the winner will be able to keep all four belts for any length of time because of mandatory fights. DuBoef said that's a discussion for another day.\n\n\"We don't know who is going to win,\" duBoef said. \"Then (after the fight) we will have to see what the order is, who has the mandatory, what order of fights and if all of the organizations can get together. If they can, great, and if they can't it will be up to the fighter to make the decisions and up to the promoters.\"\n\nIndongo will be fighting his third consecutive fight in his opponent's home region. He has gloves and will travel.\n\n\"I believe this is the time for me to show the world that a boxer from Africa, from Namibia, can beat a guy fighting in his home in front of his people. This is the best way to do it,\" Indongo said. \"I am confident in my styles and techniques that I have learned from years ago.\"\n\nAdded Frank Smith of Matchroom Boxing, \"Julius has traveled all around the world. Julius is very calm and very relaxed and really looking forward to the challenge. It's great to be involved in a fight like this with all the belts on the line, which doesn't happen very often. I know Julius is very confident to go back home with all of the belts in hand.\n\n\"Terence Crawford is a great fighter and has shown it on many occasions and Julius is very calm and relaxed and looking forward to showing what he does and he has no concerns with the traveling. He'll go anywhere to take on a challenge.\"\n\nCrawford, who won a lightweight world title in 2014 by outpointing Burns in Scotland, gave Indongo credit for his willingness to travel yet again.\n\n\"It shows a lot about his character and his confidence and his ability in the ring,\" Crawford said. \"Him being a two-time world champion in that short amount of time shows that he has a lot of confidence, but at the same time he is a little older so he's at the end of his career coming along so he doesn't have a lot of choices for what he wants to do. He can't wait around. Indongo is a good fighter. He is a good boxer. He's got good legs and he seems like he can punch. He doesn't let his opponent get on the inside and do a lot of damage to him.\"\n\nIn the televised co-feature, light heavyweight contender Oleksandr Gvozdyk (13-0, 11 KOs), 30, a 2012 Ukrainian Olympic bronze medalist, will face Craig Baker (17-1, 13 KOs), 33, of Baytown, Texas, in a scheduled 10-round bout. The telecast is slated to open with 2016 U.S. Olympic silver medalist Shakur Stevenson (2-0, 1 KO), 20, of Newark, New Jersey, facing David Paz (4-3-1, 0 KOs), 23, of Argentina, in a six-round featherweight bout.\n\nIn addition, the rest of the undercard includes a number of name fighters, albeit not necessarily in competitive fights, on paper at least. Nonetheless, appearing will be newly-signed Top Rank heavyweight Bryant Jennings (19-2, 10 KOs), 32, of Philadelphia, a former title challenger returning from a 20-month layoff; British heavyweight contender Dillian Whyte, (20-1, 15 KOs), 29, who is coming off a split decision win against Dereck Chisora in a wild 2016 fight of the year contender in December; and former junior welterweight world titleholder Mike Alvarado (37-4, 25 KOs), 37, of Denver, who is now fighting as a welterweight and seeking his fourth win in a row.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T17:15:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd":

Troyanovsky identified the 34 year-old Namibian, who had left Windhoek only once and never fought outside Africa, as perfect title-defence fodder.\n\nHe did not bring him over to be humiliated in a round, that's for sure, but that is exactly what happened. The bout was over in 40 seconds.\n\nLeft hook, bang on the button. Game over.\n\nCrawford will be 30 in September and is looking to secure his legacy.\n\nAll the excitement for him is up in the welterweight division -- in particular, a crack at Keith Thurman or Errol Spence . But he has to get past this fella first.\n\nAnd Indongo will give him problems.\n\nHe was a late starter as an amateur but represented Namibia at the 2008 Olympics and is unbeaten in 22 as a pro. He's a southpaw, a stiff hitter, if not heavy handed. He's durable, awkward and rangy.\n\nIt is difficult to assess the quality of African fighters because the coverage of boxing there is so patchy, but Indongo obviously has something about him.\n\nCrawford is like Pernell Whitaker -- only better. He fights at a great tempo, is a great puncher with more accuracy, power and flexibility than Whitaker.\n\nEverything about him is great to watch and he packs out arenas in Nebraska.\n\nIt is fascinating to see how this pans out.\n\nAs I write this, Josh is pounding the pads with my son Shane, his trainer.\n\nWould we be willing to fight Indongo? It has to be a consideration as we work out how to take him forward.\n\nI see Crawford taking his time at the start, having a look, before slowly breaking Indongo down and seeking the knockout in the last third of the fight.\n\nIf it pans out as I expect, things could be about to get very interesting for Josh Taylor.\n\nFollow Barry on Twitter at @ClonesCyclone", "dateTime":

Crawford vs. Indongo will be fighting tonight on ESPN and ESPN Deportes at the Pinnacle Bank Arena in\n\nCrawford already holds the WBC, WBO light welterweight titles, and Indongo (22-0, 11 KOs) has the IBF, WBA 140 lb. titles.\n\nCrawford (31-0, 22 KOs) for him to have a chance of surpassing #1 Andre Ward for the top spot in the pound-for-pound ratings. It might not be possible for Crawford to take that position, because the fighters in front of him arguably more exciting to watch in #2 Gennady Golovkin and #3 Roman Gonzalez. Those are all-action fighters, who score a lot of knockouts and come straight at their opponents from round 1. Crawford is much different type of fighter. He tends to move a lot, clinch frequently, and look to counter his opponents. When Crawford does KO his opponents, they knockouts often come in the later rounds after he finally stops moving and lets his hands go.\n\nIndongo is quite capable of beating Crawford if he stays composed and doesn't lose his cool at the constant switch hitting that he does. When Crawford comes forward, Indongo will need to use his jab to make sure he doesn't throw one of his single shot punches. Crawford likes to throw power shots one at a time. When his opponents throw their own punch, he'll look to counter with his own punches. That's usually when Crawford will throw combinations. He'll mix it up after he lands a counter.\n\nIt makes him vulnerable though, because he gets hit in return and doesn't look good taking shots. Indongo can give Crawford problems if he takes the fight to him and unloads. The guys that have given Crawford the most problems were Yuriorkis Gamboa, Briedis Prescott and Viktor Postol. Gamboa was getting the better of Crawford until he slipped on the canvas on round 5, and he was hit while falling down from the slip. It was a petty knockdown. It should have been ruled a slip, but the referee seemed to be sleeping at the wheel. Postol threw hard combinations that caught Crawford in round 12, and that sent him scurrying for the remainder of the round in their fight last year in July.\n\nPostol showed that when you go after Crawford and throw hard combinations, he doesn't take the shots well. They seem to unnerve him and he gets on his bike and runs. Crawford won't stand and fight. That's another reason why I feel that Crawford doesn't deserve to be ranked as the No.1 pound-for-pound fighter in boxing. He's too quick to dash off and flee from the battlefield when his opponents bring it to him. Yeah, Crawford is good at coming forward and landing pot shots when he's facing an opponent that is fighting scared. But when his opposition is brave and going after him, he'll retreat all over the ring. It's hard to watch. It's not pound-for-pound No.1 type stuff. You expect better than that from a guy that thinks he should be given the No1 pound for pound spot if he beats Indongo.\n\nCrawford will need to really wipeout the 34-year-old Indongo to go from No.4 to No.1 in Ring Magazine's pound-for-pound list. I don't think Crawford has it in him to beat a fighter like Indongo with ease. He might even lose to Indongo. The last 2 guys that fought Indongo, Ricky Burns and Eduard Troyanovsky, were supposed to beat him too, and they got dominated. Crawford didn't do as good as job defeating Burns as Indongo did. That's the only common opponent the two fighters share, and Indongo was far better than Crawford in defeating Burns. Crawford did a lot of punching and immediately grabbing Burns to keep him from getting his shots off. Indongo simply boxed Burns from the outside, nailing him with hard shots for the full 12 rounds. Indongo didn't resort to clinching excessively the way that Crawford did. If you compare the 2 fights, Indongo was far better in beating Burns. Crawford used clinching, and it was an ugly fight to watch. Crawford won, but it was a real snoozer. That's the whole problem with Crawford. He wins boring fights sometimes, and I mean really boring.\n\nSome people compare Crawford to Floyd Mayweather Jr. with the way he wins his fights. I don't see the comparison. Mayweather is more exciting due to his hand speed, reflexes and overall boxing skills. Mayweather doesn't resort to clinching or running from his opponents to win decisions. He stands in the pocket and boxes them. I only wish Crawford would do the same thing. He'd be a lot more interesting to watch.\n\n\"I have had my name mentioned in the top three,\" said Crawford in discussing the pound-for-pound ratings. \"I will be looking forward to being the top one, or maybe two after this fight. It just depends on how people look at it. In my eyes, I think I am top two already,\" said Crawford.\n\nIt's awfully hard to give Crawford the No.1 pound for pound spot when you look at the guys he's been fighting, and how he's looked winning those fights. These are the last 10 opponents Crawford has beaten:\n\nThe quality hasn't been good enough for Crawford to claim the No.1 spot in the pound-for-pound ratings in this writer's view. Andre Ward just beat Sergey Kovalev twice, and he also has wins over Sullivan Barrera, Carl Froch, Edwin Rodriguez, Mikkel Kessler and Arthur Abraham. I don't think Crawford's opposition during his career is anywhere close to being as good as Ward's. It doesn't matter if Crawford wins all 4 belts at 140.\n\nThe light welterweight division is VERY weak right. You can't blame Crawford for that. He just had the bad luck of fighting during a bad era. If a prime Kostya Tszyu was fighting in this era, Crawford would have the type of opponent to prove himself against. If Crawford's promoters at Top Rank were open to putting him in with a fighter like that, he could prove himself. But just going by Crawford's weak resume filled mediocre opposition, I don't see him worthy of a No.1 ranking. I don't think Crawford deserves to be ranked above the likes of Vasyl Lomachenko and Guillermo Rigondeaux. I don't agree with the Ring's pound-for-pound ratings at all, period. Crawford has dominated like Rigondeaux or Lomachenko.\n\nThat rankings needs to be adjusted big time Crawford should be further down towards the bottom, below Lomachenko, Rigondeaux and Mikey Garcia. To be ranked high, you need to be both exciting and your opposition needs to talented. I don't see Crawford as having beaten anyone good yet. Burns is the only good fighter Crawford beat, and he clinched him all night long. Indongo is a good fighter, but he's not good enough for Crawford to be moved past Gonzalez, Golovkin and Ward into the No.1 pound-for-pound spot. The way I see it, Crawford needs to be demoted rather than promoted in the rankings, because he's not been looking good and he's still not fighting the talented guys. Why hasn't Crawford fought Adrien Broner or Danny Garcia? If Crawford would start beating talented and well respected opposition, I could see him being moved upwards. I don't know if Crawford will ever be an exciting enough fighter to be rated No.1 in the pound-for-pound rankings, but I could see him maybe breaking the top 5. Right now, I don't think Crawford has fought good enough opposition and he's not looked exciting enough to be the top guy.\n\n\"Knockout win for Terence, by round nine,\" said Crawford's trainer Brian McIntyre to RingTV.com. \"Holding on inside,\" said McIntyre in saying what Crawford needs to watch for in the Indongo fight tonight.\n\nIndongo doesn't do a lot of holding. It's Crawford that holds Crawford was holding like mad in his fights with Burn and Raymundo Beltran. Those fights were hard to watch due to all the clinching Crawford was doing. Lately, Crawford has gotten away from his holding, but he's don't a lot of moving and that's equally boring to watch. 'Crawford hasn't fought anyone with a knockout punch since his clinch-filled win over Beltran in 2015. Crawford has fought 6 non-punchers in a row since his win over Beltran.\n\nCrawford isn't saying whether he'll move up to welterweight if he beats Indongo tonight. Crawford does say he wants to fight 147 lb. champion Keith Thurman when he does eventually move up in weight, but he's not saying when that will happen.\n\n\"That is my main focus Julius Indongo,\" said Crawford. \"We'll see how the fight goes and after that double back around and see what the next move will be,\" said Crawford.\n\nCrawford's promoter Bob Arum plans on having him travel to Australia in November for the Manny Pacquiao vs. Jeff Horn rematch. Arum is hoping he can get the winner of that fight to face Crawford. I'd be very surprised if Arum succeeds at doing that. He's been eager to make a fight between Pacquiao and Crawford for a long time, and it's still not happened. I don't think it's going to happen now. Arum also mentioned IBF welterweight champion Errol Spence Jr. as someone he wants to match Crawford up against in a PPV fight if Spence gets promoted right.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T19:14:00Z",

He's all over the country's media in the days before his super lightweight unification fight with Terence Crawford.\n\nIndongo (22-0, 11 KOs), who raised eyebrows when he went from his Southern African nation to Moscow in December and pulverized Eduard Troyanovsky with a first-round knockout and won the IBF belt, faces Crawford (31-0, 22 KOs) on Saturday in Lincoln, Nebraska for all the light-welterweight belts. The 34-year-old, who ventured to Scotland in April and beat Ricky Burns for the WBA belt, carries the hopes of his nation, and the encouragement of the nation's president.\n\nThe 2008 Olympian moves through life with his leader's words in his mind: \"Whatever your travels, be a man and know that you represent the whole of Namibia.\"\n\nWhile Indongo dominates the Namibian sports media these days, the 34-year-old knows Crawford's a heavy favorite and a formidable talent, not that this is a concern to the man from a small country that is some way from being among the world's richest.\n\n\"I am a humble guy, but I don't fear anybody,\" he said a few days before the ESPN-televised fight. \"My focus, my game-plan, everything is in position.\"\n\nIndongo's opportunities and accomplishments reflect boxing at its best, said Todd duBoef, president of Top Rank, which promotes Crawford and this card, which is set for Lincoln rather than Crawford's home of Omaha because Lady Gaga got the Omaha venue first.\n\n\"This is a global sport,\" duBoef said. \"(In the USA) we're relatively isolated to a small pool of fighters. What Indongo did was, the door of opportunity opened and he stepped through it.\"\n\nFighters emerging from relatively unknown environments is a facet of the sport's appeal, duBoef said.\n\n\"This goes back to what makes boxing so special: People take advantage of those opportunities and a diamond in the rough is discovered.\"\n\nCrawford, a heavy favorite who holds the WBC and WBO belts, discovered an intriguing opponent after the fight in Moscow.\n\n\"We never heard of Indongo or saw him fight before the fight he had in Russia,\" Crawford said recently on a conference call. \"We wanted Troyanovsky, but he turned us down and decided to go with Indongo. So, when we heard he got knocked out, we looked at the replay and that's when we took notice.\"\n\nIndongo adding another belt by dominating Burns set up the rare prospect of a four-belt unification fight, which was no small challenge to sort out, DuBoef said.\n\n\"We had to work hand in hand with (Indongo's promoter) Matchroom because obviously Matchroom and Indongo have two belts and Top Rank and Crawford has two belts and there were mandatories and everything that was coming into play,\" he said on the call. \"There were people that we had to appeal to and we said, 'Hey, this is a rare opportunity that we are able to do this. Let's try and work together and have a positive solution for the sport of boxing' and I think we delicately managed it.\"\n\nThey've managed to get the fight done when both men said they're in a fresh, active groove; the fight will be Indongo's fourth in the last 12 months, Crawford's fourth in 13 months.\n\nKeeping busy's valuable, Crawford said.\n\n\"It's always hard but at the same time, I just had a fight and getting back into the gym and back in the groove of everything, it's tougher when you have a long period of time off because this time I was somewhat in shape.\"\n\nIt's serious work - most of the time, he added\n\n\"We like to have some fun in training camp. Training camp is always hard work but have fun, hard work, have fun, hard work - if you don't love what you are doing then you need to get a difference job. We are dancing every single training camp that we had and play around - those are the different types of things that we do.\"\n\nStaying busy is good business, the 29-year-old pointed out. \"I am trying to get my name out there and trying to get the recognition that I deserve,\" he said. \"I'm still young and in my prime.\"\n\nIndongo has a slightly different perspective.\n\n\"I know that I am holding my country and Africa, on my shoulders.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T09:01:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri":

For the third consecutive fight, Namibia's Indongo will be competing in enemy territory, this time in Crawford's home state of Nebraska. While Crawford is a native of Omaha, this fight is happening at the Pinnacle Bank Arena in Lincoln.\n\nIt's the first time in the four-belt era that we're seeing a fully \"undisputed\" championship match in this weight class. \"Bud\" Crawford has been phenomenal to watch and is poised to break out as a real star in the sport. If he unifies all the major belts, one can only assume he'll look for bigger names and big money fights, even if that means moving up to welterweight. Indongo is a big underdog here, but that didn't stop him from knocking out Eduard Troyanovsky in a huge upset late last year. Once an obscure fighter who fought hardly anyone of note in Namibia, a win for Indongo over Crawford would skyrocket him into the list of top pound-for-pound fighters in the sport.\n\nBloody Elbow is here to provide you full coverage of tonight's battle for 140-pound supremacy. Here are the basic details on who's fighting tonight, how you can watch the card, where you can catch a live stream, and more.\n\nFor more boxing coverage, check out Bad Left Hook.\n\nFight time: The main broadcast starts at 10 PM ET/7 PM PT, although it could be delayed depending on whether or not the Little League World Series runs past its timeslot. Crawford vs. Indongo should start at approximately 11 PM ET/8 PM PT.\n\nTV Network: ESPN and ESPN Deportes will air the live broadcast for US viewers. Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Arena will broadcast the card in the United Kingdom.\n\nFight Card: Terence Crawford vs. Julius Indongo (junior welterweights, 12 rounds); Oleksandr Gvozdyk vs.

But Julius Indongo (22-0, 11 KOs) possesses a style so difficult it would give anyone nightmares, Crawford included.\n\nIf anyone has the best chance of pulling off an upset against the Nebraskan in Omaha, it would be the little known and enigmatic African.\n\nAn awkward, lanky southpaw, Indongo, 34, came out of obscurity (you couldn't get more obscure than Namibia) over the last eight months to capture two of the four junior welterweight belts. (Crawford owns the other two). He bounces around at a frenetic pace on springy legs while firing long, whippersnapper and deceivingly accurate punches from crazy angles.\n\nIn his two title fights, both in his opponents' backyards, Indongo has proven the ability to end a fight with a single punch 40 seconds into the fight (against Eduard Troyanovsky) and dominate for 12 rounds (against Ricky Burns).\n\nBut Crawford, 29, is the master of awkward. Sitting smack on the fence that separates awkwardness from versatility, he can fight effectively from both the southpaw and orthodox stances and shift from aggressive to defensive as and when he pleases. When things get too uncomfortable, he will strategically smother his opponent's rhythm in a clinch. He is infuriatingly hard to hit but when he does get caught, his chin has proven sturdy.\n\nThus far Crawford has not only overcome but dominated every adversary from slick speedsters to in-your-face brawlers and every style in between with ridiculous ease. Gifted with some sort of clairvoyance, Crawford stays a step or two ahead of his opponents, seemingly aware what they're going to do before they do.\n\nBut he has never faced an opponent as unpredictable as Indongo, who is more loose cannon than wild card. Will Crawford eventually figure out Indongo's style as he has everyone else and systematically break him down? Or will Indongo prove to be the ultimate gatecrashing road warrior and poop on his opponent's homecoming parade for his third consecutive title fight? Either way (short of a draw), there will be a unified and undisputed junior welterweight champion for the first time since Kostya Tszyu consolidated all the major belts in 2001.\n\nSee prediction for Crawford vs. Indongo at: http://peterliminator.blogspot.com/2017/08/terence-crawford-vs-julius-indongo.html\n\nTags: Terence Crawford Julius Indongo Crawford vs. Indongo", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T10:21:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7411764860153198, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3371416", "time": "10:21:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3371416", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "160", "label": {"eng": "Namibia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Namibia"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "303320", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "score": 4}, {"id": "303569", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Handedness"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness", "score": 4}, {"id": "310327", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "score": 5}, {"id": "313369", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Parade"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade", "score": 1}, {"id": "331116", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Terence Crawford"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Crawford", "score": 4}, {"id": "346500", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Homecoming"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homecoming", "score": 1}, {"id": "347124", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Light welterweight"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_welterweight", "score": 3}, {"id": "349135", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Clairvoyance"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clairvoyance", "score": 2}, {"id": "427871", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kostya Tszyu"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostya_Tszyu", "score": 1}, {"id": "429559", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Peter Lim"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lim", "score": 4}, {"id": "606760", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ricky Burns"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Burns", "score": 3}, {"id": "1303381", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Eduard Troyanovsky"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Troyanovsky", "score": 3}, {"id": "1303387", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Julius Indongo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Indongo", "score": 4}], "image": "http://photo.boxingscene.com/uploads/crawford-indongo%20(4).jpg", "timeCrawl": "10:21:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Crawford-Indongo Offers a Rare and Intriguing Unification Treat", "originalArticle": null}

The difference in hand speed was evident early on and the shop worn Frankel had little success mounting any type of attack.\n\nReed consistently beat him to the punch and really poured it on Frankel in the 6th round. Frankel was hurt on several occasions but was able to survive till the final bell.\n\nThe final scores were 100-90 on all three cards. After the fight Reed said, \"This is my second 10 round fight. I will fight anyone at 140 and I mean anyone.\"\n\nOmaha resident Kevin Ventura (8-0) delighted the local fans with a third round knockout of the tough Baltazar Ramirez (3-4) in their super featherweight fight. A big body shot sent Ramirez to a knee and he stayed on a knee as the referee reached a count of 10. Ventura, along with Steve Nelson, are trained by Terence Crawford's trainer Brian McIntyre.\n\nMike Alvarado (38-4) continued his way on the comeback trail with a wicked knockout of Sidney Siqueira (21-13-1) in their welterweight contest. Alvarado had to survive several rocky moments early on as Siqueira came out guns-a-blazing in the first three rounds.\n\nAlvarado went down in the third but it was correctly ruled a slip. Alvarado started to come on in the fourth with his uppercut finding a home. An uppercut had Siqueira hurt midway through the round and then a huge right hand put Siqueira down with his head bouncing off the canvas.\n\nThe TKO will be in the running for Knockout of the Year. The former super lightweight titlist has now won 4 fights in a row. The time of the stoppage was 1:20.\n\nLocal favorite Steve Nelson (9-0) kept his perfect record intact with a hard fought unanimous decision victory over a game Cesar Ruiz (5-6) in their light heavyweight bout. Ruiz was significantly smaller than Nelson but kept charging forward throughout the fight. Nelson pitched a shutout 60-54 on all three scorecards but had to work hard in only his second bout that has gone the distance in his 9 fight career.\n\nTags: Mike Reed", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T02:48:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374997", "time": "02:48:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3371416", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "215468", "label": {"eng": "Lincoln"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lincoln"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "215604", "label": {"eng": "Omaha"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "315151", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Punch (combat)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(combat)", "score": 3}, {"id": "323970", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Super featherweight"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_featherweight", "score": 3}, {"id": "327224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "score": 2}, {"id": "331116", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Terence Crawford"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Crawford", "score": 2}, {"id": "332133", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Light heavyweight"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_heavyweight", "score": 1}, {"id": "347124", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Light welterweight"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_welterweight", "score": 3}, {"id": "520655", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Uppercut"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppercut", "score": 2}, {"id": "696736", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mike Alvarado"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Alvarado", "score": 2}], "image": "http://photo.boxingscene.com/uploads/mike-reed.jpg", "timeCrawl": "02:48:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Mike Reed Dominates Rob Frankel For Decision Win", "originalArticle": null}

Here's how you can stream it online.\n\nTerence Crawford and Julius Indongo will fight to unify all the major titles in the super lightweight division live on ESPN on Saturday, and it should be a great matchup. Crawford is defending the WBC, WBO, Ring Magazine and lineal super lightweight titles, while Indongo is putting up his WBA and IBG super lightweight belts.\n\nESPN's broadcast begins at 10 p.m. ET, with a live stream online available via WatchESPN and the ESPN App on connected smartphones and other devices. A live streaming undercard has been going on since 6:30 p.m.\n\nThe television broadcast will include the Crawford vs. Indongo fight as well as a showdown between undefeated light heavyweight Oleksandr Gvozdyk and Craig Baker.\n\nCrawford (31-0, 22 KO) is already considered the best in the division by most experts and is favored in Saturday's matchup. He doesn't need the WBA and IBF titles to solidify his spot atop the division, but a true unification of major titles is a rare thing in boxing, so it's something he has his eye on.\n\nIn his last three fights, Crawford stopped Felix Diaz and John Molina Jr. and won a unanimous decision over Viktor Postol. He wants to be fighting the best fighters in his division and may be exploring contests outside the division once he gets through Saturday's match, if he gets through intact, that is.\n\nIndongo (22-0, 11 KO) is coming off a thrilling unanimous decision win over Ricky Burns in April and this is not a gimmie fight by any means. Crawford is favored by a healthy margin, but Indongo is an excellent boxer who can frustrate just about anybody if he is on his game.\n\nA December 2016 fight against Eduard Troyanovsky ended with a first-round knockout in favor of Indongo, and it was the fight that won him the IBF and IBO titles.\n\nGvozdyk (13-0, 11 KO) was a bronze medalist at the 2012 Olympics and has been a force to be reckoned with in the light heavyweight division. He is favored against Baker, an American who has fought just once over the past two years.\n\nBelow is all you need to know to stream the ESPN broadcast live online, and below that is a full list of fights from the main card and undercard.\n\nSuper lightweight: Terence Crawford vs. Julius Indongo\n\nLight heavyweight: Oleksandr Gvozdyk vs. Craig Baker\n\nWatchESPN/ESP3 Undercard (6:30 p.m.)*\n\nWelterweight: Mike Reed vs. Robert Frankel\n\nSuper featherweight: Nicholas Walters vs. Arturo Santos Reyes\n\nWelterweight: Mike Alvarado vs. Sidney Siqueira\n\nHeavyweight: Dillian Whyte vs. Malcolm Tann\n\nHeavyweight: Bryant Jennings vs. Daniel Martz\n\nSuper featherweight: Kevin Ceja Ventura vs. Baltazar Ramierz\n\nLight heavyweight: Steven Nelson vs. Cesar Ruiz\n\nFeatherweight: Shakur Stevenson vs. David Michel Paz", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T01:00:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1753, "textStart": 1740, "date": "2016-12-", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.729411780834198, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3371416", "time": "01:00:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3371416", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "303320", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "score": 3}, {"id": "303565", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Eastern Time Zone"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone", "score": 3}, {"id": "305834", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "score": 4}, {"id": "305867", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "score": 5}, {"id": "310320", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Featherweight"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featherweight", "score": 1}, {"id": "310322", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Organization", "score": 3}, {"id": "310327", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "score": 4}, {"id": "315824", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "score": 3}, {"id": "321554", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Federation"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Federation", "score": 3}, {"id": "323970", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Super featherweight"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_featherweight", "score": 1}, {"id": "323978", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Organization", "score": 2}, {"id": "327224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "score": 2}, {"id": "331116", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Terence Crawford"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Crawford", "score": 5}, {"id": "332133", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Light heavyweight"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_heavyweight", "score": 3}, {"id": "332492", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "score": 3}, {"id": "344754", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Ring (magazine)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ring_(magazine)", "score": 3}, {"id": "347124", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Light welterweight"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_welterweight", "score": 5}, {"id": "348069", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Unanimous decision"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimous_decision", "score": 3}, {"id": "348143", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Association"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Association", "score": 4}, {"id": "350921", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Council"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Council", "score": 3}, {"id": "358406", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Lineal championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineal_championship", "score": 3}, {"id": "396819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WatchESPN"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WatchESPN", "score": 3}, {"id": "398489", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Robert J.

The wars and his willingness to absorb a lot of damage have indeed caught up with him, but he is trying to revive his career and become a contender at welterweight.\n\nOn the live-streamed undercard of Terence Crawford vs. Julius Indongo in Lincoln, Nebraska, Alvarado took on Brazilian Sidney Siqueira (26-12-1, 17 KOs), who'd lost his last four but is otherwise not an easy opponent to put away. In the early stages, Siqueira was hitting Alvarado with just about any uppercut he pleased, and looked to have taken the opening two rounds. Alvarado got himself back into the fight in round 3, continued to land good shots, and finished Siqueira with this vicious right hand that that Siqueira down for a good while.\n\nWatch the video below, courtesy of Top Rank Boxing:\n\nAs an aside, Nebraskans seems to love fighting, because crowds aren't usually that loud for boxing prelims, but they've provided a good atmosphere as they wait for Omaha's own Terence Crawford's undisputed junior welterweight championship unification bout vs. Julius Indongo.\n\nFollow our live round-by-round coverage right here.

The guy in yellow headgear is Paulie Malignaggi, thirty-six, who was an accomplished (though not transcendent) professional boxer for sixteen years, until his retirement, in March. And the guy in the black headgear is Conor McGregor, the mixed-martial-arts champion, who is scheduled to compete in his first professional boxing match next week, on August 26th, against Floyd Mayweather, Jr., arguably the greatest boxer of the modern era.\n\nThis fight is a grand spectacle, and an obvious mismatch, which means that na\u00efve fans and not so na\u00efve promoters are hungry for any evidence that McGregor, in his d\u00e9but performance, has a chance against Mayweather, a virtuoso who has been in training since he was a babyand who has not lost since the 1996 Olympics, in Atlanta -- where he was, by the way, robbed. The video seemed to provide some evidence, in the form of McGregor knocking down Malignaggi. Or maybe, as Malignaggi has been claiming(quite persuasively) on Twitter, what it shows is McGregor pushing him down, using tactics that are allowed in mixed martial arts but against the rules in boxing. Even so, the video did its job, which was to give viewers reason to hope, and perhaps to buy: the fight will cost a hundred dollars, on pay-per-view.\n\nIn some markets, consumers get what they pay for; in boxing, it is more precise to say that consumers get what they are willing to pay for, which explains why the most consequential or entertaining fights are not always the most lucrative, or the most expensive. Some casual viewers may be surprised to find out that Mayweather-McGregor is not, in any meaningful sense, a championship fight: Mayweather gave up his various championships when he retired(temporarily, it turned out), in 2015; McGregor, being a novice, has no resum\u00e9, and therefore no standing to challenge for a championship. This is, in a way, refreshing: in boxing, championships are doled out by a number of rather unco\u00f6perative and unaccountable organizations, which is why many fans have learned to ignore them altogether. It's better, usually, to focus on the biggest or best matchups, and not worry about who's wearing what belt.\n\nAs it happens, though, there is a true and meaningful boxing championship looming, and at a much lower price: this Saturday night, August 19th, on ESPN, Terence Crawford, the dominant figure at junior welterweight (a hundred and forty pounds), will be fighting an obscure but worthy opponent, Julius Indongo, in a unification match between two undefeated champions. From one perspective, the details sound like boxing bureaucracy gone crazy: Crawford is recognized as champion by the World Boxing Council and the World Boxing Organization; Indongo is recognized as champion by the World Boxing Association and the International Boxing Federation. The winner gets to claim all four belts and all twelve initials: W.B.C., W.B.O., W.B.A., and I.B.F.\n\nIn every sense, a championship is much less valuable to a boxer than the kind of notoriety that Mayweather and McGregor have: in boxing, popularity translates into an athletic advantage, because big-name boxers can pick their opponents. (In McGregor's case, he gets to make his d\u00e9but against the best boxer in the world; in Mayweather's case, he gets to pick and choose, finding opponents who present the most reward and the least risk.) But winning championships is also one way to build the kind of reputation that allows boxers to ignore championships. Crawford is beloved by savvy boxing fans -- his style is slick but savage, and he has knocked out five of his last six opponents. The fight is in Lincoln, Nebraska, near Crawford's home town, Omaha, where he is building a following that includes Omaha's biggest celebrity: Warren Buffett, who has saidthat Crawford \"embodies the techniques of a sound investor.\"\n\nIndongo comes from Namibia, and he might have remained there if he hadn't figured out a way to use the complicated championship to his advantage. He had never fought anywhere else until last year, when he went to Moscow to face Eduard Troyanovsky, the I.B.F. champion. Indongo was expected to lose, but, after a shocking first-round knockout, he left Moscow with Troyanovsky's belt. This prize made Indongo an appealing opponent for Ricky Burns, a popular Scottish fighter; Burns, the W.B.A. champion, summoned Indongo to Glasgow, where he was once again an underdog. Indongo took a unanimous decision, which gave him two belts -- and which made him a plausible opponent for Crawford.\n\nOddsmakers don't seem impressed: as of Friday afternoon, one bookmaker priced Crawford at -1600, meaning that one would have to risk sixteenhundred dollars on Crawford in order to win a hundred. But Indongo is tricky: aggressive and long-limbed, with a tendency to throw lots of punches, some of them quite strange. (He knocked out Troyanovsky with a glorious, arcing left, which traced a semicircle from the far side of Indongo around and into Troyanovsky's face.) Manyexpertsnow consider Indongo the second-best junior welterweight in the world, behind Crawford. If Crawford nevertheless beats him easily, as the oddsmakers seem to think he will, that will be good evidence that Crawford deserves to be considered one of the best boxers in the world, at any weight.\n\nOne of the things that makes boxing so tantalizing is that we have so few opportunities to make judgments like these. Even Mayweather, with his decades-long undefeated streak, has competed in only forty-nine boxing matches, some of which were skills-building exercises that functioned more as exhibitions. For instance, Mayweather fought at welterweight (a hundred and forty-seven pounds) only a dozen times, which meant that figuring out how good he really was required a great deal of extrapolation. With McGregor, of course, even more extrapolation is required, and his nonexistent record adds a bit of suspense to next weekend's fight: we don't know exactly what he will look like in a boxing ring. The Malignaggi footage suggests, at the very least, that McGregor is more or less capable of throwing punches, at least for a few seconds at a time.\n\nBy contrast, Crawford vs. Indongo should provide a more violent version of the kind of sophisticated pleasure that Mayweather's fights supplied for so long. We will get a chance to watch a great fighter test himself against one who seems to be very good; by precisely measuring the distance between them, we might get a better idea of what, exactly, we mean by \"great.\" One day, if he's lucky and smart and skilled enough, Crawford may get a chance to do what Mayweather is doing: making a huge amount of money to fight a lightly regarded celebrity. For now, though, Crawford is on basic cable, with a no-name opponent who may well prove tougher than many expect. This fight is neither a spectacle nor a mismatch -- bad news, perhaps, for Crawford, but not for the rest of us.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T23:19:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 532, "textStart":

During the heated moments, a scuffle broke out between teammates of Terence and Julius that lasted another 30 seconds.\n\n\"It was a very long and tense face off. We are highly excited because you can see both fighters want this very much and I believe this will be a great fight. I was just trying to control the situation after Crawford pushed Julius and one of the guys from Crawford's camp started to push me and I told him 'take it easy, the fight is only tomorrow'. Anyway, I believe the tension between the camps was just good for the promotion of the event,\" said Nestor Tobias, manager of Indongo to BoxingScene.com.\n\nThe teams met shortly after the incident at the rules meeting and settled their differences in an intelligent way.\n\n\"After the weigh-in we went to the rules meeting and we were cool with each other and we shook hands and wished each other good luck for tonight. We are professionals and we know where to stop as we have to protect the sport of boxing.\"\n\nAccording to Tobias, Indongo is a hundred percent ready and focused on tonight's bout where all four major world title belts are at stake for the winner.\n\n\"Julius is very confident. He is a humble, soft-spoken man, who is physically and mentally ready for tonight's big fight. He was 139.8 pounds on the official scale yesterday and has gained about 8 pounds by this morning. At fight night he will be around 150 pounds.\"\n\nYou can reach Tamas Pradarics at [email protected] and follow him on Twitter @TomiPradarics.\n\nTags: Terence Crawford Crawford vs. Indongo Julius Indongo", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T21:00:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6980392336845398, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3371416", "time": "21:00:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3371416", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "215468", "label": {"eng": "Lincoln"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lincoln"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "303320", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "score": 2}, {"id": "303565", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Eastern Time Zone"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone", "score": 3}, {"id": "305867", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "score": 3}, {"id": "331116", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Terence Crawford"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Crawford", "score": 4}, {"id": "350926", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Top Rank"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Rank", "score": 3}, {"id": "644402", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pinnacle Bank Arena"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinnacle_Bank_Arena", "score": 3}, {"id": "1303387", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Julius Indongo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Indongo", "score": 4}], "image": "http://photo.boxingscene.com/uploads/crawford-indongo-weights%20(3).jpg", "timeCrawl": "21:00:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Indongo's Manager Explains Weigh-In Scuffle With Team Crawford", "originalArticle": null}

Indongo got on the Nebraska State Athletic Commission's scale at 140 pounds.\n\nOnce they got off the scale, Crawford and Indongo engaged in an unusually long staredown on the stage and had to be separated after their foreheads touched for several seconds.\n\nESPN will televise the bout between Crawford (31-0, 22 KOs), of nearby Omaha, and Indongo (22-0, 11 KOs) as the main event of a tripleheader from Pinnacle Bank Arena.\n\nThe winner will become boxing's first fully unified champion in any division since Jermain Taylor held the IBF, WBA, WBC and WBO middleweight titles after beating Bernard Hopkins in July 2005.\n\nCrawford owns the WBC and WBO 140-pound titles. Indongo holds the IBF and WBA championships, thanks to back-to-back victories over Russia's Eduard Troyanovsky (26-1, 23 KOs) - a one-punch, 40-second knockout December 3 in Moscow - and Scotland's Ricky Burns (41-6-1, 14 KOs), a 12-round, unanimous-decision win April 15 in Glasgow.\n\nLight heavyweights Oleksandr Gvozdyk and Craig Baker, who'll square off in the co-featured fight Saturday night, also made weight Friday.\n\nGvozdyk (13-0, 11 KOs), a former Ukrainian Olympian who resides in Oxnard, California, weighed 174.4 pounds, just under the light heavyweight limit of 175. Baker (17-1, 13 KOs), of Baytown, Texas, weighed 174.6 pounds.\n\nOlympic silver medalist Shakur Stevenson (2-0, 1 KO) also made weight Friday for his third professional fight, which ESPN also will televise.\n\nThe 20-year-old Newark, New Jersey, native weighed in at 126.2 pounds for his six-round featherweight fight against David Michael Paz. Argentina's Paz (4-3-1) officially weighed 125.6 pounds.\n\nKeith Idec is a senior writer/columnist for BoxingScene.com.

All four major sanctioning bodies' belts will be on the line for the ESPN televised fight.\n\nLincoln is about a 60 mile drive from Omaha and over 10,000 fans are expected to be in attendance for the fight. This will be Crawford's fifth bout in Nebraska since becoming a world champion and all of those bouts have broken the 10,000 mark in attendance.\n\nWhile that makes Crawford one do the top American draws in the sport, he has his eyes set on a much bigger goal. That goal is Memorial Stadium where the Cornhusker football team plays.\n\n\"Lincoln is a football city. If you watch Nebraska football play and you see how our state turn out each and every home game you will see how big it is. That is what I want for me and my fights. I want it to be as big as that. 80,000 people coming to each and every home game sold out. Who knows, maybe one day I can be able to fight in a football stadium,\" said Crawford.\n\nA win over Indongo will bring him one step closer to his goal.\n\nPromoted by Top Rank\u00ae, in association with Matchroom Boxing, remaining tickets to the Crawford vs. Indongo world championship event are priced at $128, $78, $53, and $28.

This will be our third event going live on ESPN and what a way to start with Pacquiao, Lomachenko and now the title unification of Terence Crawford and Julius Indongo. We are going to be in Lincoln, Nebraska this time as Lady Gaga is in Omaha. We are looking forward to Lincoln, as that's where the Cornhuskers are. This is an incredible thing to be able to do. A lot of time people talk about seeing good fights - guys fight guys that are accomplished - then there's other guys that want the challenges. Julius Indongo and his promoter, Matchroom Boxing, have come up in a meteoric rise in the past 18 months and Julius has performed great. Terence Crawford has exploded onto the boxing scene - going to Glasgow, Scotland and winning the lightweight title and coming back to Omaha in his first defense against Gamboa and winning in sensational fashion. This will be Terence's ninth consecutive world title fight over two weight divisions. It is unique in that is a highly-anticipated unification. Only the second time in the four-belt era that two world champions have fought each other to unify the titles with the winner emerging as the division's undisputed world champion.\n\nFRANK SMITH: It is great to be here in Omaha with Top Rank and we are really looking forward to this fight - it is great when fighters want to take challenges. Julius has traveled all around the world - going to Russia where he won by first round knockout and then taking on Ricky Burns in Scotland in front of a huge crowd. Julius has been spending the last few days in Omaha - I know he is very calm and very relaxed and really looking forward to the challenge. It's great to be involved in a fight like this with all the belts on the line, which doesn't happen very often. I know Julius is very confident to go back home with all of the belts in hand. Terence Crawford is a great fighter and has shown it on many occasions and Julius is very calm and relaxed and looking forward to showing what he does and he has no concerns with the traveling. He'll go anywhere to take on a challenge.\n\nNESTOR TOBIAS: We are really excited. Julius has trained very hard for this fight. He is very focused and very comfortable in Omaha. We spent some time before we came to Omaha training at Freddie Roach's Wild Card Boxing Club.\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: Thank you very much for this opportunity. I know Crawford is a very good and tough fighter and this is a big event. On Saturday night I will give everything I have and my focus and my game plan and everything is in position. Just waiting for the weigh-in. I try and not say too much before the fight, which is something that I am used to. I prefer to do it in the ring when my opponent is standing in front of me so I can do my work. I have been in boxing for a long time and not many people know me. I believe this is the time for me to show the world that a boxer from Africa from Namibia can beat a guy fighting in his home in front of his people. This is the best way to do it. I am confident in my styles and techniques that I have learned from years ago. On Saturday night it is going to be boxing - I am not sure if there is going to be a knockout but I know I can do that if I have to. I can say now that I have trained hard and my trainer is always there.\n\nTODD duBOEF: I also want to thank the organizations for accommodating this match because there was everyone trying that had fighters that had mandatories working behind the scenes to help put this unification together. We are all appreciative of everybody working together to help bring this match with the participants with all four titles of the organizations. We are very appreciative of them assisting Matchroom and Top Rank.\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: Yes I would like to also thank the organizations and Top Rank and Matchroom for pushing this fight and helping the negotiations to make this fight happen - for making it all possible.\n\nYou have two titles now, but what is your view of the possibility of having all four titles?\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: My view of this is that I have not focused much on that since I have been busy in the gym. I have not focused on anything but making sure of my performance on Saturday night. My focus has been in the gym to make sure my game will be the best ever. No one will ever forget about this fight. The organizations were involved in making this fight happen and I appreciate that but I won't think much about having four titles until the fight is over.\n\nHow will it feel walking out of the ring with four belts?\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: It's going to mean a lot to me - it will mean all of the hard work and determination got that achievement and it will create more opportunity for me. I will travel the world with the four titles. I will take them back to Africa - to my country. I am going to be very, very happy.\n\nHow hard was it to get the organizations to go along with this?\n\nTODD duBOEF: It was very difficult. We had to work hand in hand with Matchroom because obviously Matchroom and Indongo had two belts and Top Rank and Crawford had two belts and there were mandatories and everything that was coming into play. There were people that we had to appeal to and we said, \"Hey, this is a rare opportunity that we are able to do this. Let's try and work together and have a positive solution for the sport of boxing and I think we delicately managed it.\n\nHow long do you think the winner will be able to hold onto those titles?\n\nTODD duBOEF: I think we should ask that question to the winner, not before we have a winner. (A), we don't know who is going to win - Indongo thinks he is going to win and Crawford thinks he is going to win. Then at that point we will have to see what the order is, who has the mandatory, what order of fights and if all of the organizations can get together and if they can great and if they can't it will be up to the fighter to make the decisions. And up to the promoters. I think it is premature to discuss that right now.\n\nHow has your life changed since you won the two titles?\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: The thing that has really changed is - I do still live in my town in Namibia - and I try to stay focused and try do the right thing in the public. When someone becomes known to the whole country, most importantly I try not to roll with the wrong friends. I try and stay home and go to church after work and I do my training program twice a day. That's the only way that I could say it can be done.\n\nDo you live in the same place?\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: Yes, that is where I am staying and where I train. All of the people are very friendly. We don't have too much of a division within the people of everyone in the country, especially in the city. There is nothing that can distract me wherever I stay or whatever I do - everyone will know in Namibia.\n\nHow much better is Crawford than Ricky Burns or Troyanovsky?\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: I cannot really say much on that because when I fought Troyanovsky and Ricky Burns they were both easier fights than I fought in the last fight, that I fought from home. The two world title fights that I challenged in were the best training that I have trained. I had never been as focused with the best game plan so it made it the easiest fights for me. They were both easier than we ever thought they would be because of the focus on them and the game plan.\n\nWhy were you able to focus more for those two fights?\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: The other fights were happening at home and we used to be too much like let a lot of people in the camp - we used to share invitations - for the two last fights anyway. The fight was for the championship so there was something that we needed to achieve and change and to improve our image (if we want) to be known in the world. We had to have focus only on me and the potential and that's the only way the world was going to get to see me. The promotion had known what was happening with me and letting everyone else know. So now everyone was going to see something new again, I know. I have no doubt. I know. All I can say is just only if maybe knockout come it may be late. But waking up, the day of fight, be skillful and focused - everything is in position. The crowd or the fans, or Terence's home crowd won't intimidate me - that is nothing, I cannot afford it, so I travel the same way - it is always the same.\n\nSince you won in the hometowns of the last two titles fights how much confidence does that give you?\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: Actually they are different conditions I don't particularly mind because it is already past. My focus is that it is a blessing from God to keep me and not to let me wander in a sense, and to ask for a provision for myself, my president and my commander in the office that wherever I travel I will be representing all of Namibia. It's like I have the whole country of Namibia on my shoulders issued by my president so I have to rely on the game plan and that is the confidence that I rely. So if I am stepping there I know that my country and Africa is on my shoulders and when the team travels from Namibia to the fight I can only focus on the fight so it motivated me a lot. So I have to focus only on this fight.\n\nWhere did you train for this fight?\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: When I saw Crawford requested to fight the winner of the fight between me Troyanovsky, which is when I started training for this fight because we don't have any power and the only way to rely on the big guns when they are requested for it. So when they gave us the offer we had to go for it so that's when I started training. I trained at home in Namibia - where I have always been training. (He came to the States early and trained in Freddie Roach's gym in Hollywood).\n\nWhat have you noticed in the viewership of the fights on ESPN?\n\nTODD duBOEF: One thing I am looking forward to on Saturday is Kurt Warner just finished his [Hall of Fame induction] speech so we won't have to deal with that on Saturday. This is all part of a long term game plan of making these fighters come alive to the sports fan. Obviously there has been an incredible amount of promotion before the Pacquiao fight and mirrored with an incredible amount of promotion for the Lomachenko fight on August 5th and ESPN will be flipping the switch this weekend, taking the weigh-in live and doing all of the same consistent promotion and this is wonderful for the people that are interested in boxing. Everything has been terrific and to get two of the top guys in front of people that are watching the NFL, NBA and Major League Baseball are able to see the highest level of fights is just a positive step for the sport.\n\nHas there been a change in demographic of who is watching the fights?\n\nTODD duBOEF: I don't think there has been a change in demographic I think the perception of the boxing demographic in the United States has been unfortunately tight-capped - an older demographic. We are looking at these numbers and obviously 18-49 is the number that everybody wants and even with Kurt Warner and the rest of the Hall of Fame going on we went straight up against UFC that night and beat them in both 18-49 and 18-34 which are the most important demos. And I think additionally, for ESPN that week, we were the second highest rated 18-49 program with the Lomachenko broadcast and in fact over 50% of our audience was 18-49 where baseball was about 32%. We think that the story that it is an old sport and old people don't care about it, which was largely spun out by UFC years ago and I think to a certain point there was some truth to it - older demos were on premium channels - the fact is this is very positive, young, multi-cultural through the roof and we are excited to put this on this broad platform.\n\nIs it easy to focus and do what you need to do in your homeland?\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: I don't think I have an issue with the fans or the population because it is already something I am aware of. All I have is to train and just be focused on Crawford and my game plan and do good on my preparation.\n\nIndongo has come so far - a year ago no one knew who he was and now he is on this huge platform...\n\nTODD duBOEF: This is not an outlier - this is boxing. This is what happens with boxing. This is no different than Azumah Nelson coming over on 10 days notice and suddenly getting in the ring and making a name for himself in the United States. People can change the tide very quickly in the sport of boxing and that happens because of their performances and we have to recognize that his is a global sport. This is not the Premier League or the NFL or the NBA and we are relatively isolated to a small pool. Indongo is a very talented fighter who has probably worked his whole childhood figuring out how to master a trade. And that's Julius Indongo and what he did was, the door of opportunity opens and he steps through it, and that is the story of boxing. There are countless stories like that and I think this is not a miraculous one but really goes back to what makes boxing so special. People that take advantage of those opportunities and suddenly a diamond in the rough is discovered.\n\nWhat do you have to say about this activity - this is your 4th fight in just over a year?\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: It really means a lot not only to me but also to my promotion where I train. When I began they weren't planning to produce such an event or any opportunity like this or even that matches I had back home. It is something big and something huge and something useful and it is an appreciation for what Top Rank and Matchroom has put together and I appreciate these opportunities.\n\nTODD duBOEF: We have given Terence all of the accolades about how great of a fighter he is, which we all know, but I didn't know he was an internet sensation now. You have to talk about the Internet sensation! I thought this was the Brian McIntyre internet sensation in the last fight from \"Camp Life,\" but at the press conference tomorrow you've got to show me your McGregor Challenge.\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: It means a lot to me being it will be the first time that all four belts will be on the line at one time in the division's history and it has only been done twice in boxing. I'm just ready for the moment and fight time this weekend.\n\nPrior to Indongo's 1st round KO in Russia, had your team ever heard of him?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: No, we never heard of Indongo and we never saw him fight other than the fight he had in Russia.\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: Well, we wanted the Troyanovsky fight but he decided to go with Indongo so when we heard that he got knocked out, we looked at the replay and looked at the fight - that's when we first took notice of who Indongo really was.\n\nWhen he fought Ricky Burns who you are familiar with having beaten for the lightweight title, did you think you could make it happen or was it something Top Rank brought to you?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: We wanted the Ricky Burns fight at 140 as well but they didn't want to take the fight so they wanted to take the fight with Indongo and perhaps later on in the year we could do the fight between me and Ricky Burns again but Indongo beat Ricky Burns, that's when we took notice and said well he's the guy with the other two titles so let's see if we can make a fight with him and unify.\n\nWhat do you feel about him traveling anywhere to anyone's hometown to fight for titles?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: It shows a lot about his character and his confidence and his ability in the ring. Him being a two-time world champion in that short amount of time shows that he has a lot of confidence but at the same time he is a little older so he's at the end of his career coming along so he doesn't have a lot of choices for what he wants to do. He can't wait around.\n\nWhat do you think of Indongo as a fighter?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: Indongo is a good fighter. He is a good boxer - he's got good legs and he seems like he can punch. He doesn't let his opponent get on the inside and do a lot of damage to him\n\nTODD duBOEF: Do you find any similarities between him and Postol?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: The only comparison I see is the height. They have two different styles. Postol was more straight up and down. Indongo is a little more elusive. I think Postol was a little more technical. Indongo can get a little wild at times.\n\nDo you think Postol is better than Indongo?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: I can't say that because I haven't been in the ring with Indongo but I have been in the ring with Postol. You can see from the outside but once you get in the ring with somebody it can be a totally difference look so after the fight I can tell you.\n\nWhat do you think about fighting on ESPN broadening you fan base?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: It can broaden the fan base it will give more people the opportunity to see who Terence Crawford really is. To display my talent and my skills to more people - I am just ready for Saturday to come so I can show more people who Terence Crawford really is.\n\nBRIAN McINTYRE: I am just ready for us to get out there so Terence can show what he's been working on in camp. I want him to unify and make history and the 140-pound division. We can also silence all of the critics that have been saying that his resume is not as good as some fighters. Not only me but also the whole entire team is excited. I know he is excited to, to get out there and show ESPN what everybody has been hearing - that he is a great boxer and a damn good puncher and how he can switch from both sides. So I am excited. I'm excited for the kid and I'm excited for his family. I am excited for everybody.\n\nThe winner will have all four belts, which is historic. Will that fighter also be considered pound-for-pound champion?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: Of course, I think I have been doing a lot in the sport of boxing and I have had my name mentioned in the top three. I will be looking forward to being the top one, or maybe two after this fight. It just depends on how people look at it. In my eyes I think I am top two already, so.\n\nHas it bee frustrating to you that you haven't gotten credit that you deserve?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: I try to not think about that. I can't worry about what the person thinks about me or says about me. At the end of the day I'm the one that has to go in there and take the punches. A lot of people criticize me for who I am fighting because maybe I am not their favorite fighter or maybe I am doing better than their favorite fighter, or there is a fighter that they want to see me fight and the fight doesn't happen or it does happen then I beat them. Then they say 'oh the only reason Terence won was because he is short' or 'he won because he was basic' - there is always going to be an excuse with those types of people.\n\nTODD duBOEF: We are in a sport that gets dissected constantly by people that are haters, people that have agendas and at the end of the day when you have a kid like Terence Crawford who is brilliant in the ring, we just let the people decide what it is. We are going to be sold out in Lincoln, Nebraska and we just did 10,000 people in New York - we are not going to chase the game of people and bloggers and things like that that want to be hating because you will never win that game.\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: I am excited about it being that it's our state capital and where the Nebraska football team plays. It is a nice arena and I always wanted to fight in there. They brought me down there to watch a couple of games and I was always imagining it would be a nice arena to fight in. Everyone around there always welcomed me with open arms telling me 'you need to come fight here, you need to come fight here.' So I am excited that I was able to make that happen. It's about a 45-minute drive from Omaha.\n\nTODD duBOEF: Just imagine, between a 45-minute drive you've got Lady GaGa in Omaha and Terence Crawford in Lincoln - not a bad entertainment night in a small area. Brian are you going to the fight or Lady GaGa?\n\nBRYAN McINTYRE: Well I am going to go to GaGa as soon as we knock this dude off. I know her personally.\n\nCARL MORETTI: Terence is probably boxing's most active champion at this moment. His last defense was three months ago against Felix Diaz and he fought in December before that and June before that. So if you look just before he won the lightweight title it may be eight title defenses in 27 months. I don't think you can find a more active champion that has gotten better in the ring defending his title more than Crawford.\n\nHow important is it to be active?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: It is very important. I am trying to get my name out there and trying to get the recognition that I deserve. I'm still young and in my prime.\n\nWhat does it mean if Terence is able to knock out Indongo on Saturday night.\n\nBRIAN McINTYRE: That would be lovely - to do it in good fashion like that, you can't ask for nothing better. You know if you look for a knockout it's not there.\n\nIf you win you have all of the belts - would you rather stay there or move up?\n\nI am at 140 now and come Saturday that is my main focus is Julius Indongo. We'll see how the fight goes and after that double back around and see what the next move will be.\n\nHow is it when you have quick turnaround to training camp? Is it easier?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: Training camp is never easy. It's always hard but at the same time, I just had a fight and getting back into the gym and back in the groove of everything. It's tougher when you have a long period of time off because this time I was somewhat in shape.\n\nIt seems like you were having fun in camp. Is that normal?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: We like to have some fun in training camp. Training camp is always hard work but have fun, hard work, have fun, hard work - if you don't love what you are doing then you need to get a difference job. We are dancing every single training camp that we had and play around - that is the different types of things that we do. In \"Camp Life\" it might be the first time that people actually got to see that outer Terence Crawford.\n\nIs that important to you to get that out?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: It's important for my brand but at the same time it is just I. I am not into publicizing my every move - make a video and say 'oh this is what I do for a living,' I just go with the flow.\n\nIf you consider yourself Number 2 pound for pound, who do you say is Number 1?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: Andre Ward.\n\nWhere were you when you first saw McGregor do his warm-up?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: I was coming from the gym and everyone was watching a video and I asked what it was, then I said I am going to try that. A couple of days passed then I got everyone together to do the McGregor Challenge.\n\nWhat's the best response you've gotten since that video went up?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: I've been getting all kinds of response - I have been getting hate response, prejudice response, I've been getting a lot of positive response. People are telling me McGregor will beat me up. I just laugh - we are just having fun with it.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T20:22:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 10250, "textStart": 10240, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-05", "amb": false}], "sim":

This will be our third event going live on ESPN and what a way to start with Pacquiao, Lomachenko and now the title unification of Terence Crawford and Julius Indongo. We are going to be in Lincoln, Nebraska this time as Lady Gaga is in Omaha. We are looking forward to Lincoln, as that's where the Cornhuskers are. This is an incredible thing to be able to do. A lot of time people talk about seeing good fights - guys fight guys that are accomplished - then there's other guys that want the challenges. Julius Indongo and his promoter, Matchroom Boxing, have come up in a meteoric rise in the past 18 months and Julius has performed great. Terence Crawford has exploded onto the boxing scene - going to Glasgow, Scotland and winning the lightweight title and coming back to Omaha in his first defense against Gamboa and winning in sensational fashion. This will be Terence's ninth consecutive world title fight over two weight divisions. It is unique in that is a highly-anticipated unification. Only the second time in the four-belt era that two world champions have fought each other to unify the titles with the winner emerging as the division's undisputed world champion.\n\nFRANK SMITH: It is great to be here in Omaha with Top Rank and we are really looking forward to this fight - it is great when fighters want to take challenges. Julius has traveled all around the world - going to Russia where he won by first round knockout and then taking on Ricky Burns in Scotland in front of a huge crowd. Julius has been spending the last few days in Omaha - I know he is very calm and very relaxed and really looking forward to the challenge. It's great to be involved in a fight like this with all the belts on the line, which doesn't happen very often. I know Julius is very confident to go back home with all of the belts in hand. Terence Crawford is a great fighter and has shown it on many occasions and Julius is very calm and relaxed and looking forward to showing what he does and he has no concerns with the traveling. He'll go anywhere to take on a challenge.\n\nNESTOR TOBIAS: We are really excited. Julius has trained very hard for this fight. He is very focused and very comfortable in Omaha. We spent some time before we came to Omaha training at Freddie Roach's Wild Card Boxing Club.\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: Thank you very much for this opportunity. I know Crawford is a very good and tough fighter and this is a big event. On Saturday night I will give everything I have and my focus and my game plan and everything is in position. Just waiting for the weigh-in. I try and not say too much before the fight, which is something that I am used to. I prefer to do it in the ring when my opponent is standing in front of me so I can do my work. I have been in boxing for a long time and not many people know me. I believe this is the time for me to show the world that a boxer from Africa from Namibia can beat a guy fighting in his home in front of his people. This is the best way to do it. I am confident in my styles and techniques that I have learned from years ago. On Saturday night it is going to be boxing - I am not sure if there is going to be a knockout but I know I can do that if I have to. I can say now that I have trained hard and my trainer is always there.\n\nTODD duBOEF: I also want to thank the organizations for accommodating this match because there was everyone trying that had fighters that had mandatories working behind the scenes to help put this unification together. We are all appreciative of everybody working together to help bring this match with the participants with all four titles of the organizations. We are very appreciative of them assisting Matchroom and Top Rank.\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: Yes I would like to also thank the organizations and Top Rank and Matchroom for pushing this fight and helping the negotiations to make this fight happen - for making it all possible.\n\nYou have two titles now, but what is your view of the possibility of having all four titles?\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: My view of this is that I have not focused much on that since I have been busy in the gym. I have not focused on anything but making sure of my performance on Saturday night. My focus has been in the gym to make sure my game will be the best ever. No one will ever forget about this fight. The organizations were involved in making this fight happen and I appreciate that but I won't think much about having four titles until the fight is over.\n\nHow will it feel walking out of the ring with four belts?\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: It's going to mean a lot to me - it will mean all of the hard work and determination got that achievement and it will create more opportunity for me. I will travel the world with the four titles. I will take them back to Africa - to my country. I am going to be very, very happy.\n\nHow hard was it to get the organizations to go along with this?\n\nTODD duBOEF: It was very difficult. We had to work hand in hand with Matchroom because obviously Matchroom and Indongo had two belts and Top Rank and Crawford had two belts and there were mandatories and everything that was coming into play. There were people that we had to appeal to and we said, \"Hey, this is a rare opportunity that we are able to do this. Let's try and work together and have a positive solution for the sport of boxing and I think we delicately managed it.\n\nHow long do you think the winner will be able to hold onto those titles?\n\nTODD duBOEF: I think we should ask that question to the winner, not before we have a winner. (A), we don't know who is going to win - Indongo thinks he is going to win and Crawford thinks he is going to win. Then at that point we will have to see what the order is, who has the mandatory, what order of fights and if all of the organizations can get together and if they can great and if they can't it will be up to the fighter to make the decisions. And up to the promoters. I think it is premature to discuss that right now.\n\nHow has your life changed since you won the two titles?\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: The thing that has really changed is - I do still live in my town in Namibia - and I try to stay focused and try do the right thing in the public. When someone becomes known to the whole country, most importantly I try not to roll with the wrong friends. I try and stay home and go to church after work and I do my training program twice a day. That's the only way that I could say it can be done.\n\nDo you live in the same place?\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: Yes, that is where I am staying and where I train. All of the people are very friendly. We don't have too much of a division within the people of everyone in the country, especially in the city. There is nothing that can distract me wherever I stay or whatever I do - everyone will know in Namibia.\n\nHow much better is Crawford than Ricky Burns or Troyanovsky?\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: I cannot really say much on that because when I fought Troyanovsky and Ricky Burns they were both easier fights than I fought in the last fight, that I fought from home. The two world title fights that I challenged in were the best training that I have trained. I had never been as focused with the best game plan so it made it the easiest fights for me. They were both easier than we ever thought they would be because of the focus on them and the game plan.\n\nWhy were you able to focus more for those two fights?\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: The other fights were happening at home and we used to be too much like let a lot of people in the camp - we used to share invitations - for the two last fights anyway. The fight was for the championship so there was something that we needed to achieve and change and to improve our image (if we want) to be known in the world. We had to have focus only on me and the potential and that's the only way the world was going to get to see me. The promotion had known what was happening with me and letting everyone else know. So now everyone was going to see something new again, I know. I have no doubt. I know. All I can say is just only if maybe knockout come it may be late. But waking up, the day of fight, be skillful and focused - everything is in position. The crowd or the fans, or Terence's home crowd won't intimidate me - that is nothing, I cannot afford it, so I travel the same way - it is always the same.\n\nSince you won in the hometowns of the last two titles fights how much confidence does that give you?\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: Actually they are different conditions I don't particularly mind because it is already past. My focus is that it is a blessing from God to keep me and not to let me wander in a sense, and to ask for a provision for myself, my president and my commander in the office that wherever I travel I will be representing all of Namibia. It's like I have the whole country of Namibia on my shoulders issued by my president so I have to rely on the game plan and that is the confidence that I rely. So if I am stepping there I know that my country and Africa is on my shoulders and when the team travels from Namibia to the fight I can only focus on the fight so it motivated me a lot. So I have to focus only on this fight.\n\nWhere did you train for this fight?\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: When I saw Crawford requested to fight the winner of the fight between me Troyanovsky, which is when I started training for this fight because we don't have any power and the only way to rely on the big guns when they are requested for it. So when they gave us the offer we had to go for it so that's when I started training. I trained at home in Namibia - where I have always been training. (He came to the States early and trained in Freddie Roach's gym in Hollywood).\n\nWhat have you noticed in the viewership of the fights on ESPN?\n\nTODD duBOEF: One thing I am looking forward to on Saturday is Kurt Warner just finished his [Hall of Fame induction] speech so we won't have to deal with that on Saturday. This is all part of a long term game plan of making these fighters come alive to the sports fan. Obviously there has been an incredible amount of promotion before the Pacquiao fight and mirrored with an incredible amount of promotion for the Lomachenko fight on August 5th and ESPN will be flipping the switch this weekend, taking the weigh-in live and doing all of the same consistent promotion and this is wonderful for the people that are interested in boxing. Everything has been terrific and to get two of the top guys in front of people that are watching the NFL, NBA and Major League Baseball are able to see the highest level of fights is just a positive step for the sport.\n\nHas there been a change in demographic of who is watching the fights?\n\nTODD duBOEF: I don't think there has been a change in demographic I think the perception of the boxing demographic in the United States has been unfortunately tight-capped - an older demographic. We are looking at these numbers and obviously 18-49 is the number that everybody wants and even with Kurt Warner and the rest of the Hall of Fame going on we went straight up against UFC that night and beat them in both 18-49 and 18-34 which are the most important demos. And I think additionally, for ESPN that week, we were the second highest rated 18-49 program with the Lomachenko broadcast and in fact over 50% of our audience was 18-49 where baseball was about 32%. We think that the story that it is an old sport and old people don't care about it, which was largely spun out by UFC years ago and I think to a certain point there was some truth to it - older demos were on premium channels - the fact is this is very positive, young, multi-cultural through the roof and we are excited to put this on this broad platform.\n\nIs it easy to focus and do what you need to do in your homeland?\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: I don't think I have an issue with the fans or the population because it is already something I am aware of. All I have is to train and just be focused on Crawford and my game plan and do good on my preparation.\n\nIndongo has come so far - a year ago no one knew who he was and now he is on this huge platform...\n\nTODD duBOEF: This is not an outlier - this is boxing. This is what happens with boxing. This is no different than Azumah Nelson coming over on 10 days notice and suddenly getting in the ring and making a name for himself in the United States. People can change the tide very quickly in the sport of boxing and that happens because of their performances and we have to recognize that his is a global sport. This is not the Premier League or the NFL or the NBA and we are relatively isolated to a small pool. Indongo is a very talented fighter who has probably worked his whole childhood figuring out how to master a trade. And that's Julius Indongo and what he did was, the door of opportunity opens and he steps through it, and that is the story of boxing. There are countless stories like that and I think this is not a miraculous one but really goes back to what makes boxing so special. People that take advantage of those opportunities and suddenly a diamond in the rough is discovered.\n\nWhat do you have to say about this activity - this is your 4th fight in just over a year?\n\nJULIUS INDONGO: It really means a lot not only to me but also to my promotion where I train. When I began they weren't planning to produce such an event or any opportunity like this or even that matches I had back home. It is something big and something huge and something useful and it is an appreciation for what Top Rank and Matchroom has put together and I appreciate these opportunities.\n\nTODD duBOEF: We have given Terence all of the accolades about how great of a fighter he is, which we all know, but I didn't know he was an internet sensation now. You have to talk about the Internet sensation! I thought this was the Brian McIntyre internet sensation in the last fight from \"Camp Life,\" but at the press conference tomorrow you've got to show me your McGregor Challenge.\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: It means a lot to me being it will be the first time that all four belts will be on the line at one time in the division's history and it has only been done twice in boxing. I'm just ready for the moment and fight time this weekend.\n\nPrior to Indongo's 1st round KO in Russia, had your team ever heard of him?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: No, we never heard of Indongo and we never saw him fight other than the fight he had in Russia.\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: Well, we wanted the Troyanovsky fight but he decided to go with Indongo so when we heard that he got knocked out, we looked at the replay and looked at the fight - that's when we first took notice of who Indongo really was.\n\nWhen he fought Ricky Burns who you are familiar with having beaten for the lightweight title, did you think you could make it happen or was it something Top Rank brought to you?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: We wanted the Ricky Burns fight at 140 as well but they didn't want to take the fight so they wanted to take the fight with Indongo and perhaps later on in the year we could do the fight between me and Ricky Burns again but Indongo beat Ricky Burns, that's when we took notice and said well he's the guy with the other two titles so let's see if we can make a fight with him and unify.\n\nWhat do you feel about him traveling anywhere to anyone's hometown to fight for titles?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: It shows a lot about his character and his confidence and his ability in the ring. Him being a two-time world champion in that short amount of time shows that he has a lot of confidence but at the same time he is a little older so he's at the end of his career coming along so he doesn't have a lot of choices for what he wants to do. He can't wait around.\n\nWhat do you think of Indongo as a fighter?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: Indongo is a good fighter. He is a good boxer - he's got good legs and he seems like he can punch. He doesn't let his opponent get on the inside and do a lot of damage to him\n\nTODD duBOEF: Do you find any similarities between him and Postol?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: The only comparison I see is the height. They have two different styles. Postol was more straight up and down. Indongo is a little more elusive. I think Postol was a little more technical. Indongo can get a little wild at times.\n\nDo you think Postol is better than Indongo?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: I can't say that because I haven't been in the ring with Indongo but I have been in the ring with Postol. You can see from the outside but once you get in the ring with somebody it can be a totally difference look so after the fight I can tell you.\n\nWhat do you think about fighting on ESPN broadening you fan base?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: It can broaden the fan base it will give more people the opportunity to see who Terence Crawford really is. To display my talent and my skills to more people - I am just ready for Saturday to come so I can show more people who Terence Crawford really is.\n\nBRIAN McINTYRE: I am just ready for us to get out there so Terence can show what he's been working on in camp. I want him to unify and make history and the 140-pound division. We can also silence all of the critics that have been saying that his resume is not as good as some fighters. Not only me but also the whole entire team is excited. I know he is excited to, to get out there and show ESPN what everybody has been hearing - that he is a great boxer and a damn good puncher and how he can switch from both sides. So I am excited. I'm excited for the kid and I'm excited for his family. I am excited for everybody.\n\nThe winner will have all four belts, which is historic. Will that fighter also be considered pound-for-pound champion?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: Of course, I think I have been doing a lot in the sport of boxing and I have had my name mentioned in the top three. I will be looking forward to being the top one, or maybe two after this fight. It just depends on how people look at it. In my eyes I think I am top two already, so.\n\nHas it bee frustrating to you that you haven't gotten credit that you deserve?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: I try to not think about that. I can't worry about what the person thinks about me or says about me. At the end of the day I'm the one that has to go in there and take the punches. A lot of people criticize me for who I am fighting because maybe I am not their favorite fighter or maybe I am doing better than their favorite fighter, or there is a fighter that they want to see me fight and the fight doesn't happen or it does happen then I beat them. Then they say 'oh the only reason Terence won was because he is short' or 'he won because he was basic' - there is always going to be an excuse with those types of people.\n\nTODD duBOEF: We are in a sport that gets dissected constantly by people that are haters, people that have agendas and at the end of the day when you have a kid like Terence Crawford who is brilliant in the ring, we just let the people decide what it is. We are going to be sold out in Lincoln, Nebraska and we just did 10,000 people in New York - we are not going to chase the game of people and bloggers and things like that that want to be hating because you will never win that game.\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: I am excited about it being that it's our state capital and where the Nebraska football team plays. It is a nice arena and I always wanted to fight in there. They brought me down there to watch a couple of games and I was always imagining it would be a nice arena to fight in. Everyone around there always welcomed me with open arms telling me 'you need to come fight here, you need to come fight here.' So I am excited that I was able to make that happen. It's about a 45-minute drive from Omaha.\n\nTODD duBOEF: Just imagine, between a 45-minute drive you've got Lady GaGa in Omaha and Terence Crawford in Lincoln - not a bad entertainment night in a small area. Brian are you going to the fight or Lady GaGa?\n\nBRYAN McINTYRE: Well I am going to go to GaGa as soon as we knock this dude off. I know her personally.\n\nCARL MORETTI: Terence is probably boxing's most active champion at this moment. His last defense was three months ago against Felix Diaz and he fought in December before that and June before that. So if you look just before he won the lightweight title it may be eight title defenses in 27 months. I don't think you can find a more active champion that has gotten better in the ring defending his title more than Crawford.\n\nHow important is it to be active?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: It is very important. I am trying to get my name out there and trying to get the recognition that I deserve. I'm still young and in my prime.\n\nWhat does it mean if Terence is able to knock out Indongo on Saturday night.\n\nBRIAN McINTYRE: That would be lovely - to do it in good fashion like that, you can't ask for nothing better. You know if you look for a knockout it's not there.\n\nIf you win you have all of the belts - would you rather stay there or move up?\n\nI am at 140 now and come Saturday that is my main focus is Julius Indongo. We'll see how the fight goes and after that double back around and see what the next move will be.\n\nHow is it when you have quick turnaround to training camp? Is it easier?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: Training camp is never easy. It's always hard but at the same time, I just had a fight and getting back into the gym and back in the groove of everything. It's tougher when you have a long period of time off because this time I was somewhat in shape.\n\nIt seems like you were having fun in camp. Is that normal?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: We like to have some fun in training camp. Training camp is always hard work but have fun, hard work, have fun, hard work - if you don't love what you are doing then you need to get a difference job. We are dancing every single training camp that we had and play around - that is the different types of things that we do. In \"Camp Life\" it might be the first time that people actually got to see that outer Terence Crawford.\n\nIs that important to you to get that out?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: It's important for my brand but at the same time it is just I. I am not into publicizing my every move - make a video and say 'oh this is what I do for a living,' I just go with the flow.\n\nIf you consider yourself Number 2 pound for pound, who do you say is Number 1?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: Andre Ward.\n\nWhere were you when you first saw McGregor do his warm-up?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: I was coming from the gym and everyone was watching a video and I asked what it was, then I said I am going to try that. A couple of days passed then I got everyone together to do the McGregor Challenge.\n\nWhat's the best response you've gotten since that video went up?\n\nTERENCE CRAWFORD: I've been getting all kinds of response - I have been getting hate response, prejudice response, I've been getting a lot of positive response. People are telling me McGregor will beat me up. I just laugh - we are just having fun with it.\n\n*********************************\n\nUndefeated 140 pound world champions TERENCE \"Bud\" CRAWFORD and JULIUS INDONGO, collide in a world title unification battle, Saturday, August 19, at Pinnacle Bank Arena in Lincoln, Nebraska.

Four months later, he traveled to Glasgow, Scotland, and added the WBA 140-pound championship to his collection by out-boxing Ricky Burns (41-6-1, 14 KOs) over 12 rounds.\n\n\"It shows a lot about his character and his confidence in his ability in the ring,\" Crawford said during a conference call Wednesday. \"Him being a two-time world champion and in this short a period of time shows that he's got a lot of confidence. But at the same time, he's a little older [34], so he's at the end of his career coming along. So he really don't have a lot of choices with what he wanna do. He can't wait around for a long period of time, with how old he is.\"\n\nBefore he went to Moscow to challenge Russia's Troyanovsky, each of Indongo's first 20 professional fights took place in his home country of Namibia, a small country of slightly more than 2 million residents in western Africa. Indongo (22-0, 11 KOs) will encounter Crawford (31-0, 22 KOs) at Lincoln's Pinnacle Bank Arena, about a 45-minute drive from Crawford's hometown of Omaha.\n\nDespite Indongo's impressive run over the past eight months, the 29-year-old Crawford is approximately an 11-1 favorite over the tall, rangy southpaw.\n\n\"Indongo's a good fighter,\" said Crawford, who owns the WBC and WBO super lightweight titles. \"He's a good boxer. He's got good legs. He seems like he can punch a little bit. He don't let his opponent get on the inside and do a lot of damage to him. So that's a good thing.\"\n\nKeith Idec is a senior writer/columnist for BoxingScene.com.

Both fighters made weight before their bout in Nebraska this Saturday.\n\nThe Namibian Indongo, owner of the WBA belt, hit the scales at 139 pounds, while Crawford stopped the scale at 140 pounds. This bout is one of the most significant in the division in recent years because it involves the most important championships and two undefeated boxers who are possibly the best in this category.\n\nThe height of the boxers puts an interesting ingredient into the fight, which seeks to proclaim the real king at 140 pounds today.\n\nCrawford, with a great career in the United States and a native of Omaha, is at the top of boxing both in the sport and commercially. He has won his 31 professional fights, 22 of them by knockout and is looking to take another step in his successful career. On the other hand, Indongo has made a great career in Africa and Europe mainly and after defeating Ricky Burns, he earned the right to have this fight.

In fact, he cited President Hage Geingob as one of the people who will be extremely proud of his exploits against the Scot.\n\nHe is the epitome of a national champion, who even before throwing a punch has already won by uniting the nation as it rallies behind him.\n\nThe Namibian boxing wunderkind, plucked from obscurity in the eyes of global boxing pundits, will step into the ring to confront the equally dangerous Crawford for the multiple title unification fight of the century at the Pinnacle Bank Arena in Lincoln, Nebraska in the United States of America (USA) in the early hours of Sunday.\n\nFrom humble beginnings in the amateur ranks, Indongo has built an amazing run of 22 consecutive wins, with 12 of those fights finishing within the distance since joining the paid ranks.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of the legendary Harry Simon, Paulus 'The Hitman' Paulus and Paulus 'The Rock' Ambunda, Namibian boxing is without an iota of doubt on the up and Indongo is certainly up there with the very best in world boxing pound for pound.\n\nYet, given the often-shoddy fashion in which boxing scorecards are systematically manipulated, we pray that Indongo will not find himself at the receiving end of cooked scores to help save the reputation of his opponent.\n\nThe dominant view is that champions never lose easily on home turf and unless Indongo makes short work of his opponent the Namibian can expect a much harder time in the ring than expected and should at least throw twice as many punches to remain at the level on the scores.\n\nBoth boxers are phenomenal fighters pound for pound, but Indongo - a southpaw - has shown maturity that belies his short stint as a professional boxer.\n\nWe pin our hopes on his devastating form of late, capped by excellent displays of confidence, magnanimity and fearlessness, but often at the risk of bringing heaps of muck down on his followers.\n\nYes, he is not the most entertaining boxer around, but he is an incredible fighter for his age -indeed for any age - but he specialises in taking his opponents' fight away from them by plodding forward at amazing pace, like a wounded tiger.\n\nWhile some predict an easy payday for the American, anyone with half a brain knows for sure that Julies can bring a contest to a premature end whenever he likes and Crawford's corner will be better advised than to underestimate the hard-hitting Namibian.\n\nWin or lose, tomorrow's historic fight is likely to add a new dimension not only to the overall growth sport in Africa, but Namibia in particular.\n\nVictory will propel Julies and his handlers to greater heights, with their names proudly engraved in the golden pages of our national sporting archives.\n\nNot since Harry Simon became world champion at Carousel in 1998 has the sport of leather trading captured the imagination of Namibians from all walks of life to such an extent where cultural and clan affiliation, as well as tribal loyalties and sentiments are cast aside in the national interest, albeit temporarily.\n\nOne thing is for sure: irrespective of the outcome, this fight is destined to define the overall lifestyle of this down-to-earth young man, who still holds an 8 to 5 job as an inspector with the Namibian police.\n\nLet's all rally behind this son of the soil and keep him in our prayers.\n\nGo for gold Julius, make Namibia proud again!", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T09:23:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3371416", "time": "09:23:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3371416", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "160", "label": {"eng": "Namibia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Namibia"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "88694", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "215468", "label": {"eng": "Lincoln"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lincoln"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "215604", "label": {"eng": "Omaha"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302606", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport", "score": 2}, {"id": "303320", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "score": 5}, {"id": "303539", "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 2}, {"id": "329430", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing", "score": 2}, {"id": "331116", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Terence Crawford"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Crawford", "score": 3}, {"id": "344196", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Hage Geingob"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hage_Geingob", "score": 3}, {"id": "356363", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Namibian"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Namibian", "score": 3}, {"id": "367718", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pound for pound"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound", "score": 3}, {"id": "606760", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ricky Burns"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Burns", "score": 3}, {"id": "644402", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pinnacle Bank Arena"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinnacle_Bank_Arena", "score": 3}, {"id": "710184", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Flag of Namibia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Namibia", "score": 3}, {"id": "862145", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paulus Ambunda"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulus_Ambunda", "score": 3}, {"id": "862146", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Harry Simon (boxer)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Simon_(boxer)", "score": 3}, {"id": "1303387", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Julius Indongo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Indongo", "score": 4}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "09:23:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Indongo a winner, even without throwing a punch", "originalArticle": null}

Their super lightweight bout will be a proper unification bout and will crown the top 140-pound fighter in the world. The IBF World, WBA Super World, WBC World and WBO World Super Lightweight championships will be on the line.\n\nSaturday's card begins at 6:30 p.m. ET with a preliminary card stream on ESPN3. There's a full list of undercard fights to get through before the ESPN broadcast begins at 10 p.m. That broadcast will also be streamed via WatchESPN and the ESPN App on various devices.\n\nCrawford (31-0, 22 KO) made his name with a series of wins on HBO and he is favored against Namibia's Indongo. Crawford, in addition to owning the WBC and WBO title, is the Ring Magazine and lineal division champion. Indongo has the WBA and IBF titles, and the winner of Saturday's bout will hold all of the major titles in this division.\n\nThat's a big deal, as it's not something that happens often in the sport given the long list of titles and how difficult it can be to get a match completed.\n\nIndongo (22-0, 11 KO) is somewhat lesser known, but he's a dangerous opponent for Crawford. He is coming off a big win over Ricky Burns in April, and many believe he has what it takes to really push Crawford.\n\nThe ESPN broadcast will also feature Oleksandr Gvozdyk (13-0, 11 KO), an undefeated light heavyweight prospect out of the Ukraine.

That fight, one of the best you'll see this year, is backed by a strong undercard headlined by a showcase bout for Oleksandr Gvozdyk.\n\nThe undercard begins at 6:30 p.m. ET and the featured bouts will be live streamed online on ESPN3 and via the ESPN App. The main card, featuring the Crawford vs. Indongo bout and Gvozdyk's feature against Craig Baker, begins at 10 p.m. on ESPN.\n\nThat main card will also be streamed via WatchESPN and the ESPN App.\n\nGvozdyk (13-0, 11 KO) is the top name on the undercard. The undefeated light heavyweight prospect had an incredibly eventful amateur career, including a bronze medal in the 2012 Olympics, and he's been a force since turning professional. He is heavily favored against Baker, and he is counting on a big step up in the near future after getting some exposure on Saturday's card.\n\nBaker has just one fight in the past two years. He's not a pushover overall, but he should get beaten handily by Gvozdyk.\n\nShakur Stevenson (2-0, 1 KO) was a silver medalist at the 2016 Olympics, and he'll be competing in just his third professional bout on the undercard. His match against David Michel Paz (4-3-1, 0 KO) will be among the matches that make it onto the online stream.\n\nBelow is all the viewing information you need for Saturday's card, including the undercard stream.

Midway through the third round, Crawford caught Indongo with a left hook to the body that put him down writhing in pain.\n\nThe fight was the first four-belt unification bout since 2004, when Bernard Hopkins stopped Oscar De La Hoya to claim all the belts in the 160-pound division.

The undercard featured stars such as Bryant Jennings, Mike Alvarado and Mike Reed fought on the undercard and emerged victorious.\n\nPhoto Credit: Top Rank Promotions\n\nThe first bout of the night was between former Olympian and prized prospect Shakur Stevenson (2-0) and David Paz (4-3-1) in the super featherweight division.\n\nStevenson, a southpaw, opened up the fight with quick, accurate combinations while staying outside of the range of Paz. His counter right hand and right uppercut was finding it's home in the second round, and Stevenson was finding success going to the body in the third round.\n\nPaz was clearly outmatched and lost his mouthpiece in the third round, had his knees buckled from a straight left hand in the fourth round, and was knocked down from a straight left hand in the fifth round.\n\nStevenson probably had some opportunities to finish the fight but wasn't able to capitalize it. He won with scores of 60-53 on all three scorecards.\n\nThe next bout of the night was in the light heavyweight division between Oleksandr Gvozdyk (13-0) and Craig Baker (17-1) in the light heavyweight division.\n\nGvozdyk's nickname is the \"Nail\" and he had a lot of hype coming into this fight. Baker kept a high guard early and Gvozdyk seemed content to stay behind his jab. Gvozdyk wasn't very impressive in the first three rounds of the fight but was doing enough to win the rounds.\n\nBaker was able to land some punches in the fourth round but wasn't able to match the work rate of Gvozdyk. Gvozdyk landed some heavy shots at the end of the fifth round and he started to move away from using his jab.\n\nThe end came in the sixth round when Gvozdyk landed a short right hand that sent Baker down. Baker was able to get back to his feet and told the referee he wanted to continue, but Gvozdyk immediately jumped on Baker with unanswered combinations and forced the referee to stop the bout.\n\nOleksandr Gvozdyk wins by TKO at 2:04 of the sixth round.\n\nThe main event of the evening was between Terence Crawford (31-0) and Julius Indongo (22-0) for the WBA, WBO, WBC, and IBF Junior Welterweight Titles.\n\nIndongo entered the ring first and was greeted by the chorus of boos from the Nebraskan crowd. Terence Crawford decided to walk in through the crowd instead of the usual ring walk on the ground and was greeted warmly by his fans.\n\nIndongo looked like he was several inches taller and longer than Crawford. Crawford, despite traditionally fighting in an orthodox position, came out fighting as a southpaw.\n\nCrawford opened up the fight by landing a counter left hook and Indongo answered with a looping and wide lead right hook. Crawfrod was able to stay out of the range of his taller opponent and was accurate with his counter hooks.\n\nIndongo kept his jab in the face of Crawford at the start of the second round but Crawford was able to time Indongo and land a hard left hook followed by a right uppercut. Crawford was able to roll with Indongo's punches and land a left hand that sent Indongo down to the mat. Indongo looked like he was still buzzed when he got to his feet but survived the round.\n\nIndongo, to his credit, started off the third round aggressively. Crawford however was able to stay calm and counter a combination by Indongo and land a hard left hand to the body that sent Indongo crashing to the mat writing in pain.\n\nThe referee counted to ten and Indongo was unable to get up.

His counter right hand and right uppercut was finding it's home in the second round, and Stevenson was finding success going to the body in the third round.\n\nPaz was clearly outmatched and lost his mouthpiece in the third round, had his knees buckled from a straight left hand in the fourth round, and was knocked down from a straight left hand in the fifth round.\n\nStevenson probably had some opportunities to finish the fight but wasn't able to capitalize it. He won with scores of 60-53 on all three scorecards.\n\nThe next bout of the night was in the light heavyweight division between Oleksandr Gvozdyk (13-0) and Craig Baker (17-1) in the light heavyweight division.\n\nGvozdyk's nickname is the \"Nail\" and he had a lot of hype coming into this fight. Baker kept a high guard early and Gvozdyk seemed content to stay behind his jab. Gvozdyk wasn't very impressive in the first three rounds of the fight but was doing enough to win the rounds.\n\nBaker was able to land some punches in the fourth round but wasn't able to match the work rate of Gvozdyk. Gvozdyk landed some heavy shots at the end of the fifth round and he started to move away from using his jab.\n\nThe end came in the sixth round when Gvozdyk landed a short right hand that sent Baker down. Baker was able to get back to his feet and told the referee he wanted to continue, but Gvozdyk immediately jumped on Baker with unanswered combinations and forced the referee to stop the bout.\n\nOleksandr Gvozdyk wins by TKO at 2:04 of the sixth round.\n\nThe main event of the evening was between Terence Crawford (31-0) and Julius Indongo (22-0) for the WBA, WBO, WBC, and IBF Junior Welterweight Titles.\n\nIndongo entered the ring first and was greeted by the chorus of boos from the Nebraskan crowd. Terence Crawford decided to walk in through the crowd instead of the usual ring walk on the ground and was greeted warmly by his fans.\n\nIndongo looked like he was several inches taller and longer than Crawford. Crawford, despite traditionally fighting in an orthodox position, came out fighting as a southpaw.\n\nCrawford opened up the fight by landing a counter left hook and Indongo answered with a looping and wide lead right hook. Crawfrod was able to stay out of the range of his taller opponent and was accurate with his counter hooks.\n\nIndongo kept his jab in the face of Crawford at the start of the second round but Crawford was able to time Indongo and land a hard left hook followed by a right uppercut. Crawford was able to roll with Indongo's punches and land a left hand that sent Indongo down to the mat. Indongo looked like he was still buzzed when he got to his feet but survived the round.\n\nIndongo, to his credit, started off the third round aggressively. Crawford however was able to stay calm and counter a combination by Indongo and land a hard left hand to the body that sent Indongo crashing to the mat writing in pain.\n\nThe referee counted to ten and Indongo was unable to get up.

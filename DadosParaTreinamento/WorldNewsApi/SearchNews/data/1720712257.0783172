The 49-year-old BJP leader, who defeated Ravindra Dhangekar of the Congress in the recent Lok Sabha elections, will be the third Puneite, after Suresh Kalmadi and Prakash Javadekar, making it to the Union cabinet. He will also be the second Lok Sabha MP from Pune, after the Congress\u2019s Kalmadi, to become a Union minister in nearly 30 years. Javadekar was a Rajya Sabha member. \u201cSuresh Kalmadi was minister of state for railways in the Congress government in 1995. I think he was the minister for some six months,\u201d said Pune Congress spokesperson Ramesh Iyer. Mohol is a former mayor of Pune and a former standing committee chairperson of the civic body. The choice of Mohol, a first-time MP with no ministerial experience, has surprised political circles in Pune. \u201cKalmadi and Javadekar had been in politics and top leaders of their parties for many years before they became Union ministers. Mohol has no such credentials. Probably, the BJP has done this with an eye on the Assembly elections,\u201d said Iyer. However, the BJP said they had only two options from western Maharashtra\u2014one was Mohol and the other Chhatrapati Udayanraje Bhosale, elected from Satara. \u201cThe party has picked Mohol maybe because he is a Maratha face who would be much required during the ensuing Assembly elections. Besides, he is young and enterprising. He has kept the party\u2019s momentum going in the past five years and played a key role in pushing for the city\u2019s development,'' said BJP spokesperson Sandeep Khardekar. For his part, Mohol said he was also surprised by his cabinet berth. \u201cI had come to Delhi for the swearing-in ceremony of the prime minister. I thought I would return home after the swearing-in ceremony. I had also booked flight tickets for Pune. But today I suddenly got calls from BJP chief Naddji and Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who told me to come to the PM\u2019s house.. I had never in my dream thought that I would come this far in my political journey,\u201d he told reporters in Delhi. \u201cNow that I am being included in the central cabinet, I will take up whatever responsibility the PM gives me,\u201d he added.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/bjp-murlidhar-mohol-mp-union-minister-bjp-9381648/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/ch1857831.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:23:12", "author": "Manoj Dattatrye More", "authors": ["Manoj Dattatrye More"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.05}

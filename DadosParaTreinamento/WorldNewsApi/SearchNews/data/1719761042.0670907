The 43-year-old purchased her home with inheritance money from her dad, which paid for a deposit worth half the value of her property. A few years later, her boyfriend, who was an unpaid volunteer, moved in. \u2018Once he moved in, it took [him] about another year to find work,\u2019 Katherine says. While she hadn\u2019t asked him to pay rent when he was job hunting, she assumed he\u2019d start contributing when he got hired. \u2018The understanding was that once he was employed he would pay some rent to help with the living expenses,\u2019 she explains. Her partner didn\u2019t have to pay anything when he wasn\u2019t working but now he earns more than she does (Picture: Getty Images/Westend61) \u2018I was making more than him and since it\u2019s my house and I am building equity, I didn\u2019t feel 50/50 would be fair so I asked for $500/month [\u00a3391],\u2019 she explains. \u2018That is about a fraction of what someone would pay to rent a room, much less all the utilities, supplies and whatever other bills pop up.\u2019 Since October last year though, her boyfriend, who she plans to marry, has only paid her the $500 twice. He\u2019s even since got a new job with a salary that means he is now the higher earner in their relationship. \u2018I mentioned I\u2019d like him to chip in a bigger share. He got pretty angry and reluctantly agreed to $800/mo (\u00a3627) \u2013 this is still far less than half the mortgage, doesn\u2019t touch the bills, and is far, far below any sort of market rate for around here,\u2019 Katherine says. \u2018I have to chase him to get any money and generally he will send me half the rent amount saying he will pay the rest with the next check but it never comes.\u2019 As a result of her boyfriend\u2019s erratic rent payments, Katherine is now overdrawn each month, but he feels it\u2019s unfair that he is expected to pay, because it\u2019s not his house. In fact, he doesn\u2019t even buy groceries or toilet paper \u2013 and never turns off the lights when he leave the house. \u2018When I have expressed my frustration in his lack of financial contribution he demands to be put on the lease and claims then he will pay more,\u2019 she adds. Katherine, who posted her dilemma to Reddit, is questioning if she\u2019s being unreasonable, but people in the comments have branded him \u2018a major red flag\u2019. Katherine can\u2019t afford their bills and her mortgage since her partner moved in (Picture: Getty Images) \u2018You are dating a Grade A, bona fide cheapskate,\u2019 wrote one user (22-beekeeper). \u2018He doesn\u2019t want to contribute rent because he doesn\u2019t want to pay your mortgage. He has forgotten any other bills exist. I wouldn\u2019t stay with him. Money will always be a big fight for you two. He is going to squirrel away his money, and sit back to watch you struggle.\u2019 Another (mecegirl) was equally as stunned: \u2018Who started that stupidity? Its called rent!! Folks need to stop trying to freeload.\u2019 But while the situation may seem clear cut \u2013 legal experts have a different opinion. \u2018Owning a property solely and being unmarried to your partner can lead to financial complications,\u2019 Yasmin Khan-Gunns, family associate at Keystone Law, tells Metro.co.uk. \u2018Without a formal written agreement, and with the mortgage, utilities, and bills in your name, you are responsible for paying them. While it\u2019s reasonable to ask your partner to contribute to bills and living expenses, you cannot force them to do so without an agreement.\u2019 The same issue would apply if Katherine was renting \u2013 her partner is only legally obligated to pay for rent and bills if he is on the rental agreement. And, while it may seem unfair for them to \u2018freeload\u2019, as the Redditors put it, if you do decide to ask your partner to contribute \u2013 without their name being on any document \u2013 you could be opening up a can of worms. \u2018You risk, with any sort of contribution towards mortgage payments, your partner subsequently claiming that they have a beneficial entitlement in the property,\u2019 Yasmin says. Katherine doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019s in the wrong but wants him to contribute fairly to the home they live in (Picture: Getty Images) So, what\u2019s the best solution? Rachel Fisher, Partner at Stowe Family Law, advises that couples sign a cohabitation agreement. \u2018It will clearly set out what each party owns and has an interest in, what each party will pay towards outgoings, and what happens should they split up,\u2019 Rachel says. \u2018The owner of the property needs to ensure that whatever the arrangement is, it is clear that the other party is not obtaining an interest in the property through the contributions that they are making.\u2019 This is not a legally binding agreement in England and Wales though, so it\u2019s important to seek legal advice when drawing up this agreement to make it as \u2018watertight as possible\u2019. Of course, in Katherine\u2019s situation, she may now be considering if she wants to stay with her partner. Relationship expert Hayley Quinn, tells Metro: \u2018At the core of this issue, is a man who is taking more out of the relationship than he\u2019s putting in, leaving his female partner feeling taken advantage of. Katherine could ask him to move out which could help salvage their relationship (Picture: Getty Images) \u2018Her partner seems disinterested in contributing, or giving more to build the relationship. More than that, gestures like never buying any loo roll, and leaving on the lights, suggest a casual disregard for his partner\u2019s finances and feelings,\u2019 she says. Constantly chasing her partner for money will make her feel like a \u2018parent\u2019 according to the expert, and \u2018erode any attraction\u2019 she feels toward him. The solution? Hayley says: \u2018This woman needs to stop holding in her resentment and have a frank conversation with her partner where she lays down her boundaries. \u2018Apart from her partner regularly contributing financially, he needs to make a big jump up in the consideration levels he shows her. \u2018If words aren\u2019t enough then the male partner could move out, stand on his own two feet, and from there (maybe) they can get their relationship back on track.\u2019 Do you have a story to share?

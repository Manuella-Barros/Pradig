On that form, they are asked whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBiden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his book and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nHe was able to purchase the gun and kept it for less than a month before it was thrown by his lover into a trash receptacle outside the upscale Janssen's Market grocery store in Greenville. This prompted a Delaware State Police search for a man who found the gun while collecting recyclables outside the store and - several years later - drew federal prosecutors' attention back to the form.\n\nThe first two relate specifically to the form he filled out to purchase the gun, accusing Biden of lying about this drug use on the form.\n\nThe third charge pertains to Biden's possession of a firearm while he was allegedly an unlawful user or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nWhat must prosecutors prove to the jury?\n\nFor the first charge, prosecutors must generally convince the jury that:\n\nThe second charge is similar. Prosecutors need to show that Biden knowingly made a false statement, but need not show the statement was material to the transaction.\n\nFor the third charge, prosecutors need to prove:\n\nWhat is a user and an 'addict'?\n\nTo find Biden was an unlawful user of controlled substances or addicted to drugs, the jury must have a common definition of what those terms mean in order to apply the evidence to the question. This has been a hotly litigated topic in pretrial motions and continues to be where defense attorneys are concentrating their litigation days ahead of trial.\n\nLast week, Judge Maryellen Noreika granted the prosecutors' motion barring defense attorneys from arguing or suggesting that they must show Biden used controlled substances the day of the firearm purchase in order to get a guilty verdict.\n\nProsecutors successfully argued that relevant definitions dictate they need to simply show that the \"unlawful use has occurred recently enough to indicate that the individual is actively engaged in such conduct.\"\n\nRecent: What is an addict? Hunter Biden is fighting what that means as gun trial looms\n\nHowever, the debate on the issue continues as of Wednesday in litigation over what definitions jurors will work with. On Wednesday, defense attorney submitted arguments seeking a more constrained definition of \"addict\" and unlawful user than what prosecutors have sought in their proposed jury instructions.\n\nAmong other requests, defense filings request specific instructions telling the jury that if they do not find that Biden knew himself to fit the definition of drug user or \"addict\" at the time he purchased the gun, the verdict must be not guilty.\n\nHow the judge decides these definitions and instructions could be key to how Biden defends himself at trial.\n\nWhat evidence and witnesses will prosecutors use?\n\nRegardless of what definitions are ultimately presented to the jury, prosecutors have a mountain of evidence showing Biden's drug use.\n\nA primary vein of evidence will be Biden's own words exploring his drug use in his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things.\" In it, he said he was in active addiction for four years leading to March 2019 and speaks about rehab and relapses, according to excerpts identified by prosecutors.\n\nProsecutors will also lean on his text messages: missives like, \"I was sleeping in a car smoking crack on 4 Street and Rodney.\"\n\nThe book: Hunter Biden says he was 'smoking crack every 15 minutes', more jaw-dropping moments from memoir 'Beautiful Things'\n\nAdditionally, they will call close family witnesses including what court documents indicate are his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, as well as Hallie Biden, the widow of Biden's brother and Hunter Biden's former lover. In court, prosecutors said these witnesses will testify to Biden's conduct, as well as verify digital communications entered as evidence in the trial.\n\nProsecutors also intend to call witnesses from the gun shop to testify about the purchase of the revolver.\n\nWhat will Biden's defense argue?\n\nSo far, defense attorneys have unsuccessfully sought to toss the case using arguments that the charges are legally defective.\n\nAs trial looms, his attorneys have hinted at a defense that emphasizes the requirement that prosecutors show that Biden knowingly lied about his status as an unlawful drug user when he filled out paperwork to purchase the gun.\n\nAbbe Lowell, Biden's primary defense attorney, has sought permission to introduce at trial expert testimony from a specialist who can testify regarding a person with addiction's understanding of and state of denial about their own addiction.\n\n\"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict,\" Lowell wrote in court documents filed earlier this month.\n\nProsecutors have argued that Lowell submitted paperwork to admit that witness too late, asking the judge to bar such testimony.\n\nSecondarily, Lowell has hinted he may seek a line of questioning that attacks the credibility of the gun shop employees responsible for keeping the form on which Biden is accused of lying.\n\nThis avenue was opened by the fact that the form was altered between when it was first emailed to federal authorities in 2018 and when the original was turned over to federal investigators years later. Employees at the gun shop added another form of identification verification to the form after the fact that may not have actually been submitted by Biden, according to court documents.\n\nIn court, Lowell said the alteration calls the credibility of the shop employees to question and presents questions over whether the witnesses are obtaining a benefit from prosecutors since they appeared to have, like Biden, written false information on the form.\n\nWho will decide whether Biden is guilty?\n\nA jury of 12 picked from residents of New Castle County will evaluate the evidence and be tasked with rendering the verdict. Because of the high-profile nature of the defendant, hundreds are being called into the courthouse for jury selection on Monday.\n\nThe court will use pre-decided questions to cull potential jurors who can't be impartial down to a smaller pool. Then, prosecutors and defense attorneys will have the choice to strike a certain number of prospective jurors. This process could take days.\n\nWhere is this happening and how long will it take?\n\nAfter jury selection, each side will present opening statements and prosecutors will begin to call witnesses.\n\nProsecutors have said they expect to take three days to present their case. Lowell, Biden's attorney, indicated he will possibly also present a case and said if he does, it won't take double the time prosecutors have projected for their own.\n\nRecent: Hunter Biden appears in Wilmington court ahead of looming gun trial. Here's what happened\n\nIn all, the court expects the case to last about two weeks.\n\nThe trial will take place in the federal courthouse on King Street in downtown Wilmington.\n\nA piece of trivia: The court is housed in the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building, named after the former U.S. senator a young Joe Biden defeated in 1972 to launch his political career in Washington D.C.\n\nWho is the judge?\n\nFederal Judge Maryellen Noreika is presiding over the case.\n\nHer career before the bench centered on civil litigation: intellectual property cases and corporate litigation in federal and state courts. Later on, she'd gain experience representing children in Delaware's Family Court.\n\nIn 2017, Sens. Tom Carper and Chris Coons put forward Noreika and Colm F. Connolly to fill judicial vacancies in the Delaware District. Then-President Donald Trump nominated Noreika and Connolly, and she was confirmed the following year.\n\nThe Judge: Biden gun charges remain before judge who questioned plea deal, placing spotlight on her\n\nHer political affiliations and contributions have been mixed, according to past reporting.\n\nNoreika gained national attention last year when a plea deal for Biden fell apart under her pointed questioning of the parties. Both sides went into the hearing having agreed to a deal that would have resolved both the gun case, as well as pending tax charges against Biden with a misdemeanor plea and recommended sentence of probation only.\n\nFailed Plea Deal: Here's how Hunter Biden's expected plea deal fell apart, leading to his not guilty plea\n\nHowever, Noreika repeatedly complained that both parties wanted her \"rubber stamp\" on the \"unusual\" agreement and subjected them to hours of questions. Her line of inquiry ultimately exposed differences in each side's interpretation of the deal and led to her ordering further legal briefings that prompted the sides to abandon the deal.\n\nCould the president's son go to prison?\n\nThe charges carry a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison, though Biden is likely to get a shorter sentence if convicted. It is atypical for defendants to get a maximum sentence when they are first-time offenders like Biden.\n\nWhat about Biden's taxes?\n\nSeparately, Biden faces tax evasion charges in a California case now set to go to trial this fall.\n\nCali Case: Back-to-back Hunter Biden trial schedule gets spaced out as California judge delays", "source": {"uri": "delawareonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Controlled substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Revolver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lowell, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lowell, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_202", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Route 202"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_State_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware State Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.38_Special", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": ".38 Special"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crack cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courthouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Courthouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenville,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenville, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greenville, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Buhle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kathleen Buhle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryellen_Noreika", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maryellen Noreika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbe_Lowell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abbe Lowell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Caleb_Boggs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

The culmination of a sprawling investigation, the deal between Hunter Biden and prosecutors was going to spare him a politically explosive trial in the middle of his father's reelection campaign and likely prison time.\n\nBut it all fell apart.\n\nNow, Hunter Biden is headed to trial on federal gun charges in a case brought by his father's Justice Department at a time when America's political and legal worlds are colliding like never before. Dogged for years by investigations, scrutinized over his troubled personal life and vilified by Republicans, the younger Biden is now also confronting the threat of felony convictions and time behind bars.\n\nThe case opening Monday with jury selection in Delaware is not about Hunter Biden's business dealings, which have been the focus of the yearslong federal investigation and Republicans' fruitless impeachment inquiry into the Democratic president. It's about a gun Hunter Biden had for about 11 days -- a .38-caliber Colt Cobra Special. Prosecutors say he bought it illegally in October 2018 because he falsely swore on a federal form that he was not a drug user. He never fired the gun, according to his lawyers, and it ended up dumped in a trash can.\n\nThe trial will lack details about his foreign business matters that Republicans have seized on to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt, but it is expected to feature deeply personal and embarrassing testimony about dark time in the younger Biden's life. And it probably will provide new political impetus for Donald Trump's allies, who are eager to distract from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's own legal problems after he was convicted of 34 felony counts in his hush money trial.\n\nAllies of Joe Biden are worried about the toll the trial may take on the president, who already is concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as that son's darkest moments are relived in public. They also are worried that the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign while facing anemic poll numbers and is scheduled to prepare in Wilmington for a June 27 debate with Trump as the trial plays out nearby.\n\nTHE DEAL THAT NEVER WAS\n\nIt once looked like Hunter Biden was going to avoid prosecution in the gun case altogether.\n\nThe deal was announced last June. Nearly three years earlier, Hunter Biden had confirmed the federal investigation into his tax affairs in December 2020, shortly after his father was elected.\n\nThe younger Biden would have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses; prosecutors would have recommended two years of probation. There was also a \"diversion agreement\" that would have allowed him to escape prosecution on a felony gun charge as long he stayed out of trouble for two years.\n\nBut the plea hearing quickly unraveled.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, quizzed both sides with concerns about the deal. To her, it seemed unusual and required her to be involved in the case in a way most federal judges are not. The lawyers huddled, trying to salvage the deal. At one point they could be heard yelling at each other.\n\n\"Well, we'll just rip it up!\" Chris Clark, Biden's then-attorney, shouted as tempers flared.\n\n\"So what do we do now?\" the judge later asked the lawyers.\n\n\"Then there is no deal,\" prosecutor Leo Wise told her.\n\nA few weeks later, Attorney General Merrick Garland named David Weiss, the Trump-nominated U.S. attorney in Delaware who was leading the investigation, as a special counsel.\n\nHunter Biden was indicted a month after that on three gun counts. They are punishable by up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.\n\nCOURTROOM TENSION\n\nThe bitterness between prosecutors and Hunter Biden's legal team is glaring. It's likely to be on display Monday.\n\nClark withdrew from the case, saying he might be called to testify in a potential legal dispute over the now-defunct deal. Another defense lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has accused Weiss of caving to political pressure to indict the president's son after Trump and other Republicans blasted the \"sweetheart deal.\" The defense has noted that charges related to gun possession by drug users are rare when not in connection with a more serious crime.\n\n\"Mr. Biden is not being prosecuted for any sin that DOJ (the Department of Justice) believes he has committed. He is being punished for the perceived sins of his father -- the sin of opposing Mr. Trump's election to the president,\" according to court papers filed by Lowell, who also has represented Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the former president's daughter and son-in-law.\n\nProsecutors say Lowell's contention is \"fiction designed for a Hollywood script.\"\n\n\"Contrary to his assertion, he has not established that the Special Counsel, appointed by and serving at the pleasure of President Biden and his Attorney General, is punishing the defendant 'for the perceived sins of his father' in order to capitulate to a former President because of his tweets,\" Weiss' team responded.\n\nWeiss has said \"political considerations\" played no part in the investigation. He told lawmakers behind closed doors last year that that no one at the Justice Department prevented him from pursuing charges or taking other necessary steps, disputing claims from two IRS whistleblowers that the department improperly interfered in the tax investigation.\n\nA DARK TIME\n\nThe case stems from a period where, by his own admission, Hunter Biden was addicted to crack.\n\nIn his memoir \"Beautiful Things,\" he described becoming consumed by drugs and alcohol after his older brother, Beau, died in 2015 at age 46 from brain cancer. The brothers were very close, having survived a car crash when they were young that killed their mother and baby sister.\n\nHunter Biden has said he has been sober since 2019. But prosecutors intend to use his memoir to make the case that he knew he was addicted to drugs when he denied it on the form that every person must fill out when buying a gun. They plan to show jurors text messages, videos and photos of Hunter Biden smoking crack, as well details about cocaine residue that authorities say was found on the pouch he used to hold his gun.\n\n\"I'm a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I've ruined every relationship I've ever cherished,\" Hunter Biden wrote in one text message weeks after he bought the firearm, according to prosecutors.\n\nJurors are expected to hear testimony from his ex-wife and other former romantic partners, including Beau's widow, Hallie Biden, with whom Hunter Biden had a relationship after his brother's death. Hallie Biden found the gun in Hunter Biden's truck and threw it in a trash. It was found by a man collecting recyclables who gave it to the police.\n\nThe defense has suggested it will attack the credibility of the gun shop employees, noting there were changes to the gun-purchase form after the sale. Prosecutors say there were minor additions unrelated to the parts Hunter Biden filled out. His lawyers have suggested they may argue that Hunter Biden did not see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form.\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" the defense wrote in a recent filing. \"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nThe case is expected to last a couple of weeks. He also is scheduled to stand trial in September in California in the case where he is accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over four years.\n\n_____\n\nAssociated Press writer

The culmination of a sprawling investigation, the deal between Hunter Biden and prosecutors was going to spare him a politically explosive trial in the middle of his father's reelection campaign and likely prison time.\n\nWASHINGTON: President Joe Biden's son was in federal court, prepared to plead guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses. The culmination of a sprawling investigation, the deal between Hunter Biden and prosecutors was going to spare him a politically explosive trial in the middle of his father's reelection campaign and likely prison time.\n\nBut it all fell apart.\n\nNow, Hunter Biden is headed to trial on federal gun charges in a case brought by his father's Justice Department at a time when America's political and legal worlds are colliding like never before. Dogged for years by investigations, scrutinized over his troubled personal life and vilified by Republicans, the younger Biden is now also confronting the threat of felony convictions and time behind bars.\n\nThe case opening Monday with jury selection in Delaware is not about Hunter Biden's business dealings, which have been the focus of the yearslong federal investigation and Republicans' fruitless impeachment inquiry into the Democratic president. It's about a gun Hunter Biden had for about 11 days -- a .38-caliber Colt Cobra Special. Prosecutors say he bought it illegally in October 2018 because he falsely swore on a federal form that he was not a drug user. He never fired the gun, according to his lawyers, and it ended up dumped in a trash can.\n\nThe trial will lack details about his foreign business matters that Republicans have seized on to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt, but it is expected to feature deeply personal and embarrassing testimony about dark time in the younger Biden's life. And it probably will provide new political impetus for Donald Trump's allies, who are eager to distract from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's own legal problems after he was convicted of 34 felony counts in his hush money trial.\n\nAllies of Joe Biden are worried about the toll the trial may take on the president, who already is concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as that son's darkest moments are relived in public. They also are worried that the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign while facing anemic poll numbers and is scheduled to prepare in Wilmington for a June 27 debate with Trump as the trial plays out nearby.\n\nIt once looked like Hunter Biden was going to avoid prosecution in the gun case altogether.\n\nThe deal was announced last June. Nearly three years earlier, Hunter Biden had confirmed the federal investigation into his tax affairs in December 2020, shortly after his father was elected.\n\nThe younger Biden would have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses; prosecutors would have recommended two years of probation. There was also a \"diversion agreement\" that would have allowed him to escape prosecution on a felony gun charge as long he stayed out of trouble for two years.\n\nBut the plea hearing quickly unraveled.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, quizzed both sides with concerns about the deal. To her, it seemed unusual and required her to be involved in the case in a way most federal judges are not. The lawyers huddled, trying to salvage the deal. At one point they could be heard yelling at each other.\n\n\"Well, we'll just rip it up!\" Chris Clark, Biden's then-attorney, shouted as tempers flared.\n\n\"So what do we do now?\" the judge later asked the lawyers.\n\n\"Then there is no deal,\" prosecutor Leo Wise told her.\n\nA few weeks later, Attorney General Merrick Garland named David Weiss, the Trump-nominated U.S. attorney in Delaware who was leading the investigation, as a special counsel.\n\nHunter Biden was indicted a month after that on three gun counts.

The culmination of a sprawling investigation, the deal between Hunter Biden and prosecutors was going to spare him a politically explosive trial in the middle of his father's reelection campaign and likely prison time.\n\nBut it all fell apart.\n\nNow, Hunter Biden is headed to trial on federal gun charges in a case brought by his father's Justice Department at a time when America's political and legal worlds are colliding like never before. Dogged for years by investigations, scrutinized over his troubled personal life and vilified by Republicans, the younger Biden is now also confronting the threat of felony convictions and time behind bars.\n\nThe case opening Monday with jury selection in Delaware is not about Hunter Biden's business dealings, which have been the focus of the yearslong federal investigation and Republicans' fruitless impeachment inquiry into the Democratic president. It's about a gun Hunter Biden had for about 11 days -- a .38-caliber Colt Cobra Special. Prosecutors say he bought it illegally in October 2018 because he falsely swore on a federal form that he was not a drug user. He never fired the gun, according to his lawyers, and it ended up dumped in a trash can.\n\nThe trial will lack details about his foreign business matters that Republicans have seized on to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt, but it is expected to feature deeply personal and embarrassing testimony about dark time in the younger Biden's life. And it probably will provide new political impetus for Donald Trump's allies, who are eager to distract from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's own legal problems after he was convicted of 34 felony counts in his hush money trial.\n\nAllies of Joe Biden are worried about the toll the trial may take on the president, who already is concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as that son's darkest moments are relived in public. They also are worried that the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign while facing anemic poll numbers and is scheduled to prepare in Wilmington for a June 27 debate with Trump as the trial plays out nearby.\n\nTHE DEAL THAT NEVER WAS\n\nIt once looked like Hunter Biden was going to avoid prosecution in the gun case altogether.\n\nThe deal was announced last June. Nearly three years earlier, Hunter Biden had confirmed the federal investigation into his tax affairs in December 2020, shortly after his father was elected.\n\nThe younger Biden would have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses; prosecutors would have recommended two years of probation. There was also a \"diversion agreement\" that would have allowed him to escape prosecution on a felony gun charge as long he stayed out of trouble for two years.\n\nBut the plea hearing quickly unraveled.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, quizzed both sides with concerns about the deal. To her, it seemed unusual and required her to be involved in the case in a way most federal judges are not. The lawyers huddled, trying to salvage the deal. At one point they could be heard yelling at each other.\n\n\"Well, we'll just rip it up!\" Chris Clark, Biden's then-attorney, shouted as tempers flared.\n\n\"So what do we do now?\" the judge later asked the lawyers.\n\n\"Then there is no deal,\" prosecutor Leo Wise told her.\n\nA few weeks later, Attorney General Merrick Garland named David Weiss, the Trump-nominated U.S. attorney in Delaware who was leading the investigation, as a special counsel.\n\nHunter Biden was indicted a month after that on three gun counts. They are punishable by up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.\n\nCOURTROOM TENSION\n\nThe bitterness between prosecutors and Hunter Biden's legal team is glaring. It's likely to be on display Monday.\n\nClark withdrew from the case, saying he might be called to testify in a potential legal dispute over the now-defunct deal. Another defense lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has accused Weiss of caving to political pressure to indict the president's son after Trump and other Republicans blasted the \"sweetheart deal.\" The defense has noted that charges related to gun possession by drug users are rare when not in connection with a more serious crime.\n\n\"Mr. Biden is not being prosecuted for any sin that DOJ (the Department of Justice) believes he has committed. He is being punished for the perceived sins of his father -- the sin of opposing Mr. Trump's election to the president,\" according to court papers filed by Lowell, who also has represented Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the former president's daughter and son-in-law.\n\nProsecutors say Lowell's contention is \"fiction designed for a Hollywood script.\"\n\n\"Contrary to his assertion, he has not established that the Special Counsel, appointed by and serving at the pleasure of President Biden and his Attorney General, is punishing the defendant 'for the perceived sins of his father' in order to capitulate to a former President because of his tweets,\" Weiss' team responded.\n\nWeiss has said \"political considerations\" played no part in the investigation. He told lawmakers behind closed doors last year that that no one at the Justice Department prevented him from pursuing charges or taking other necessary steps, disputing claims from two IRS whistleblowers that the department improperly interfered in the tax investigation.\n\nA DARK TIME\n\nThe case stems from a period where, by his own admission, Hunter Biden was addicted to crack.\n\nIn his memoir \"Beautiful Things,\" he described becoming consumed by drugs and alcohol after his older brother, Beau, died in 2015 at age 46 from brain cancer. The brothers were very close, having survived a car crash when they were young that killed their mother and baby sister.\n\nHunter Biden has said he has been sober since 2019. But prosecutors intend to use his memoir to make the case that he knew he was addicted to drugs when he denied it on the form that every person must fill out when buying a gun. They plan to show jurors text messages, videos and photos of Hunter Biden smoking crack, as well details about cocaine residue that authorities say was found on the pouch he used to hold his gun.\n\n\"I'm a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I've ruined every relationship I've ever cherished,\" Hunter Biden wrote in one text message weeks after he bought the firearm, according to prosecutors.\n\nJurors are expected to hear testimony from his ex-wife and other former romantic partners, including Beau's widow, Hallie Biden, with whom Hunter Biden had a relationship after his brother's death. Hallie Biden found the gun in Hunter Biden's truck and threw it in a trash. It was found by a man collecting recyclables who gave it to the police.\n\nThe defense has suggested it will attack the credibility of the gun shop employees, noting there were changes to the gun-purchase form after the sale. Prosecutors say there were minor additions unrelated to the parts Hunter Biden filled out. His lawyers have suggested they may argue that Hunter Biden did not see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form.\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" the defense wrote in a recent filing. \"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nThe case is expected to last a couple of weeks. He also is scheduled to stand trial in September in California in the case where he is accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over four years.\n\n_____\n\nAssociated Press writer

On that form, they are asked whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBiden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his book and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nHe was able to purchase the gun and kept it for less than a month before it was thrown by his lover into a trash receptacle outside the upscale Janssen's Market grocery store in Greenville. This prompted a Delaware State Police search for a man who found the gun while collecting recyclables outside the store and - several years later - drew federal prosecutors' attention back to the form.\n\nThe first two relate specifically to the form he filled out to purchase the gun, accusing Biden of lying about this drug use on the form.\n\nThe third charge pertains to Biden's possession of a firearm while he was allegedly an unlawful user or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nWhat must prosecutors prove to the jury?\n\nFor the first charge, prosecutors must generally convince the jury that:\n\nThe second charge is similar. Prosecutors need to show that Biden knowingly made a false statement, but need not show the statement was material to the transaction.\n\nFor the third charge, prosecutors need to prove:\n\nWhat is a user and an 'addict'?\n\nTo find Biden was an unlawful user of controlled substances or addicted to drugs, the jury must have a common definition of what those terms mean in order to apply the evidence to the question. This has been a hotly litigated topic in pretrial motions and continues to be where defense attorneys are concentrating their litigation days ahead of trial.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika granted the prosecutors' motion barring defense attorneys from arguing or suggesting that they must show Biden used controlled substances the day of the firearm purchase in order to get a guilty verdict.\n\nProsecutors successfully argued that relevant definitions dictate they need to simply show that the \"unlawful use has occurred recently enough to indicate that the individual is actively engaged in such conduct.\"\n\nRecent: What is an addict? Hunter Biden is fighting what that means as gun trial looms\n\nHowever, the debate on the issue continues as of Wednesday in litigation over what definitions jurors will work with. On Wednesday, defense attorney submitted arguments seeking a more constrained definition of \"addict\" and unlawful user than what prosecutors have sought in their proposed jury instructions.\n\nAmong other requests, defense filings request specific instructions telling the jury that if they do not find that Biden knew himself to fit the definition of drug user or \"addict\" at the time he purchased the gun, the verdict must be not guilty.\n\nHow the judge decides these definitions and instructions could be key to how Biden defends himself at trial.\n\nWhat evidence and witnesses will prosecutors use?\n\nRegardless of what definitions are ultimately presented to the jury, prosecutors have a mountain of evidence showing Biden's drug use.\n\nA primary vein of evidence will be Biden's own words exploring his drug use in his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things.\" In it, he said he was in active addiction for four years leading to March 2019 and speaks about rehab and relapses, according to excerpts identified by prosecutors.\n\nProsecutors will also lean on his text messages: missives like, \"I was sleeping in a car smoking crack on 4 Street and Rodney.\"\n\nThe book: Hunter Biden says he was 'smoking crack every 15 minutes', more jaw-dropping moments from memoir 'Beautiful Things'\n\nAdditionally, they will call close family witnesses including what court documents indicate are his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, as well as Hallie Biden, the widow of Biden's brother and Hunter Biden's former lover. In court, prosecutors said these witnesses will testify to Biden's conduct, as well as verify digital communications entered as evidence in the trial.\n\nProsecutors also intend to call witnesses from the gun shop to testify about the purchase of the revolver.\n\nWhat will Biden's defense argue?\n\nSo far, defense attorneys have unsuccessfully sought to toss the case using arguments that the charges are legally defective.\n\nAs trial looms, his attorneys have hinted at a defense that emphasizes the requirement that prosecutors show that Biden knowingly lied about his status as an unlawful drug user when he filled out paperwork to purchase the gun.\n\nAbbe Lowell, Biden's primary defense attorney, has sought permission to introduce at trial expert testimony from a specialist who can testify regarding a person with addiction's understanding of and state of denial about their own addiction.\n\n\"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict,\" Lowell wrote in court documents filed earlier this month.\n\nProsecutors have argued that Lowell submitted paperwork to admit that witness too late, asking the judge to bar such testimony.\n\nSecondarily, Lowell has hinted he may seek a line of questioning that attacks the credibility of the gun shop employees responsible for keeping the form on which Biden is accused of lying.\n\nThis avenue was opened by the fact that the form was altered between when it was first emailed to federal authorities in 2018 and when the original was turned over to federal investigators years later. Employees at the gun shop added another form of identification verification to the form after the fact that may not have actually been submitted by Biden, according to court documents.\n\nIn court, Lowell said the alteration calls the credibility of the shop employees to question and presents questions over whether the witnesses are obtaining a benefit from prosecutors since they appeared to have, like Biden, written false information on the form.\n\nWho will decide whether Biden is guilty?\n\nA jury of 12 picked from residents of New Castle County will evaluate the evidence and be tasked with rendering the verdict. Because of the high-profile nature of the defendant, hundreds are being called into the courthouse for jury selection on Monday.\n\nThe court will use pre-decided questions to cull potential jurors who can't be impartial down to a smaller pool. Then, prosecutors and defense attorneys will have the choice to strike a certain number of prospective jurors. This process could take days.\n\nWhere is this happening and how long will it take?\n\nAfter jury selection, each side will present opening statements and prosecutors will begin to call witnesses.\n\nProsecutors have said they expect to take three days to present their case. Lowell, Biden's attorney, indicated he will possibly also present a case and said if he does, it won't take double the time prosecutors have projected for their own.\n\nRecent: Hunter Biden appears in Wilmington court ahead of looming gun trial. Here's what happened\n\nIn all, the court expects the case to last about two weeks.\n\nThe trial will take place in the federal courthouse on King Street in downtown Wilmington.\n\nA piece of trivia: The court is housed in the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building, named after the former U.S. senator a young Joe Biden defeated in 1972 to launch his political career in Washington D.C.\n\nWho is the judge?\n\nFederal Judge Maryellen Noreika is presiding over the case.\n\nHer career before the bench centered on civil litigation: intellectual property cases and corporate litigation in federal and state courts. Later on, she'd gain experience representing children in Delaware's Family Court.\n\nIn 2017, Sens. Tom Carper and Chris Coons put forward Noreika and Colm F. Connolly to fill judicial vacancies in the Delaware District. Then-President Donald Trump nominated Noreika and Connolly, and she was confirmed the following year.\n\nThe Judge: Biden gun charges remain before judge who questioned plea deal, placing spotlight on her\n\nHer political affiliations and contributions have been mixed, according to past reporting.\n\nNoreika gained national attention last year when a plea deal for Biden fell apart under her pointed questioning of the parties. Both sides went into the hearing having agreed to a deal that would have resolved both the gun case, as well as pending tax charges against Biden with a misdemeanor plea and recommended sentence of probation only.\n\nFailed Plea Deal: Here's how Hunter Biden's expected plea deal fell apart, leading to his not guilty plea\n\nHowever, Noreika repeatedly complained that both parties wanted her \"rubber stamp\" on the \"unusual\" agreement and subjected them to hours of questions. Her line of inquiry ultimately exposed differences in each side's interpretation of the deal and led to her ordering further legal briefings that prompted the sides to abandon the deal.\n\nCould the president's son go to prison?\n\nThe charges carry a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison, though Biden is likely to get a shorter sentence if convicted. It is atypical for defendants to get a maximum sentence when they are first-time offenders like Biden.\n\nWhat about Biden's taxes?\n\nSeparately, Biden faces tax evasion charges in a California case now set to go to trial this fall.\n\nCali Case: Back-to-back Hunter Biden trial schedule gets spaced out as California judge delays\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "xerxes_wilson@yahoo.com", "name": "Xerxes Wilson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Controlled substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Revolver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lowell, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lowell, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_202", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Route 202"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_State_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware State Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.38_Special", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": ".38 Special"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crack cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenville,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenville, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greenville, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Buhle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kathleen Buhle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryellen_Noreika", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maryellen Noreika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbe_Lowell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abbe Lowell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_instructions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury instructions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Caleb_Boggs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

The culmination of a sprawling investigation, the deal between Hunter Biden and prosecutors was going to spare him a politically explosive trial in the middle of his father's reelection campaign and likely prison time.\n\nBut it all fell apart.\n\nNow, Hunter Biden is headed to trial on federal gun charges in a case brought by his father's Justice Department at a time when America's political and legal worlds are colliding like never before. Dogged for years by investigations, scrutinized over his troubled personal life and vilified by Republicans, the younger Biden is now also confronting the threat of felony convictions and time behind bars.\n\nThe case opening Monday with jury selection in Delaware is not about Hunter Biden's business dealings, which have been the focus of the yearslong federal investigation and Republicans' fruitless impeachment inquiry into the Democratic president. It's about a gun Hunter Biden had for about 11 days -- a .38-caliber Colt Cobra Special. Prosecutors say he bought it illegally in October 2018 because he falsely swore on a federal form that he was not a drug user. He never fired the gun, according to his lawyers, and it ended up dumped in a trash can.\n\nThe trial will lack details about his foreign business matters that Republicans have seized on to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt, but it is expected to feature deeply personal and embarrassing testimony about dark time in the younger Biden's life. And it probably will provide new political impetus for Donald Trump's allies, who are eager to distract from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's own legal problems after he was convicted of 34 felony counts in his hush money trial.\n\nAllies of Joe Biden are worried about the toll the trial may take on the president, who already is concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as that son's darkest moments are relived in public. They also are worried that the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign while facing anemic poll numbers and is scheduled to prepare in Wilmington for a June 27 debate with Trump as the trial plays out nearby.\n\nTHE DEAL THAT NEVER WAS\n\nIt once looked like Hunter Biden was going to avoid prosecution in the gun case altogether.\n\nThe deal was announced last June. Nearly three years earlier, Hunter Biden had confirmed the federal investigation into his tax affairs in December 2020, shortly after his father was elected.\n\nThe younger Biden would have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses; prosecutors would have recommended two years of probation. There was also a \"diversion agreement\" that would have allowed him to escape prosecution on a felony gun charge as long he stayed out of trouble for two years.\n\nBut the plea hearing quickly unraveled.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, quizzed both sides with concerns about the deal. To her, it seemed unusual and required her to be involved in the case in a way most federal judges are not. The lawyers huddled, trying to salvage the deal. At one point they could be heard yelling at each other.\n\n\"Well, we'll just rip it up!\" Chris Clark, Biden's then-attorney, shouted as tempers flared.\n\n\"So what do we do now?\" the judge later asked the lawyers.\n\n\"Then there is no deal,\" prosecutor Leo Wise told her.\n\nA few weeks later, Attorney General Merrick Garland named David Weiss, the Trump-nominated U.S. attorney in Delaware who was leading the investigation, as a special counsel.\n\nHunter Biden was indicted a month after that on three gun counts. They are punishable by up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.\n\nCOURTROOM TENSION\n\nThe bitterness between prosecutors and Hunter Biden's legal team is glaring. It's likely to be on display Monday.\n\nClark withdrew from the case, saying he might be called to testify in a potential legal dispute over the now-defunct deal. Another defense lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has accused Weiss of caving to political pressure to indict the president's son after Trump and other Republicans blasted the \"sweetheart deal.\" The defense has noted that charges related to gun possession by drug users are rare when not in connection with a more serious crime.\n\n\"Mr. Biden is not being prosecuted for any sin that DOJ (the Department of Justice) believes he has committed. He is being punished for the perceived sins of his father -- the sin of opposing Mr. Trump's election to the president,\" according to court papers filed by Lowell, who also has represented Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the former president's daughter and son-in-law.\n\nProsecutors say Lowell's contention is \"fiction designed for a Hollywood script.\"\n\n\"Contrary to his assertion, he has not established that the Special Counsel, appointed by and serving at the pleasure of President Biden and his Attorney General, is punishing the defendant 'for the perceived sins of his father' in order to capitulate to a former President because of his tweets,\" Weiss' team responded.\n\nWeiss has said \"political considerations\" played no part in the investigation. He told lawmakers behind closed doors last year that that no one at the Justice Department prevented him from pursuing charges or taking other necessary steps, disputing claims from two IRS whistleblowers that the department improperly interfered in the tax investigation.\n\nA DARK TIME\n\nThe case stems from a period where, by his own admission, Hunter Biden was addicted to crack.\n\nIn his memoir \"Beautiful Things,\" he described becoming consumed by drugs and alcohol after his older brother, Beau, died in 2015 at age 46 from brain cancer. The brothers were very close, having survived a car crash when they were young that killed their mother and baby sister.\n\nHunter Biden has said he has been sober since 2019. But prosecutors intend to use his memoir to make the case that he knew he was addicted to drugs when he denied it on the form that every person must fill out when buying a gun. They plan to show jurors text messages, videos and photos of Hunter Biden smoking crack, as well details about cocaine residue that authorities say was found on the pouch he used to hold his gun.\n\n\"I'm a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I've ruined every relationship I've ever cherished,\" Hunter Biden wrote in one text message weeks after he bought the firearm, according to prosecutors.\n\nJurors are expected to hear testimony from his ex-wife and other former romantic partners, including Beau's widow, Hallie Biden, with whom Hunter Biden had a relationship after his brother's death. Hallie Biden found the gun in Hunter Biden's truck and threw it in a trash. It was found by a man collecting recyclables who gave it to the police.\n\nThe defense has suggested it will attack the credibility of the gun shop employees, noting there were changes to the gun-purchase form after the sale. Prosecutors say there were minor additions unrelated to the parts Hunter Biden filled out. His lawyers have suggested they may argue that Hunter Biden did not see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form.\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" the defense wrote in a recent filing. \"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nThe case is expected to last a couple of weeks. He also is scheduled to stand trial in September in California in the case where he is accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over four years.\n\nAssociated Press writer Colleen in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000.

On that form, they are asked whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBiden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his book and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nHe was able to purchase the gun and kept it for less than a month before it was thrown by his lover into a trash receptacle outside the upscale Janssen's Market grocery store in Greenville. This prompted a Delaware State Police search for a man who found the gun while collecting recyclables outside the store and - several years later - drew federal prosecutors' attention back to the form.\n\nWhy is that allegedly a crime?\n\nBiden faces three firearms felonies.\n\nThe first two relate specifically to the form he filled out to purchase the gun, accusing Biden of lying about this drug use on the form.\n\nThe third charge pertains to Biden's possession of a firearm while he was allegedly an unlawful user or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nWhat must prosecutors prove to the jury?\n\nFor the first charge, prosecutors must generally convince the jury that:\n\nBiden filled out the form and that he made a false statement, specifically that he was an unlawful user of or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nThat he knew that statement was false.\n\nThat the statement was meant to deceive the salesman on a fact material to the sale. In other words: the sale would not have occurred had he answered otherwise.\n\nThe second charge is similar. Prosecutors need to show that Biden knowingly made a false statement, but need not show the statement was material to the transaction.\n\nFor the third charge, prosecutors need to prove:\n\nBiden was either an unlawful user of or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nThat he knowingly possessed the firearm.\n\nThat he knew he was an unlawful user of or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nWhat is a user and an 'addict'?\n\nTo find Biden was an unlawful user of controlled substances or addicted to drugs, the jury must have a common definition of what those terms mean in order to apply the evidence to the question. This has been a hotly litigated topic in pretrial motions and continues to be where defense attorneys are concentrating their litigation days ahead of trial.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika granted the prosecutors' motion barring defense attorneys from arguing or suggesting that they must show Biden used controlled substances the day of the firearm purchase in order to get a guilty verdict.\n\nProsecutors successfully argued that relevant definitions dictate they need to simply show that the \"unlawful use has occurred recently enough to indicate that the individual is actively engaged in such conduct.\"\n\nRecent: What is an addict? Hunter Biden is fighting what that means as gun trial looms\n\nHowever, the debate on the issue continues as of Wednesday in litigation over what definitions jurors will work with. On Wednesday, defense attorney submitted arguments seeking a more constrained definition of \"addict\" and unlawful user than what prosecutors have sought in their proposed jury instructions.\n\nAmong other requests, defense filings request specific instructions telling the jury that if they do not find that Biden knew himself to fit the definition of drug user or \"addict\" at the time he purchased the gun, the verdict must be not guilty.\n\nHow the judge decides these definitions and instructions could be key to how Biden defends himself at trial.\n\nWhat evidence and witnesses will prosecutors use?\n\nRegardless of what definitions are ultimately presented to the jury, prosecutors have a mountain of evidence showing Biden's drug use.\n\nA primary vein of evidence will be Biden's own words exploring his drug use in his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things.\" In it, he said he was in active addiction for four years leading to March 2019 and speaks about rehab and relapses, according to excerpts identified by prosecutors.\n\nProsecutors will also lean on his text messages: missives like, \"I was sleeping in a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney.\"\n\nThe book: Hunter Biden says he was 'smoking crack every 15 minutes', more jaw-dropping moments from memoir 'Beautiful Things'\n\nAdditionally, they will call close family witnesses including what court documents indicate are his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, as well as Hallie Biden, the widow of Biden's brother and Hunter Biden's former lover. In court, prosecutors said these witnesses will testify to Biden's conduct, as well as verify digital communications entered as evidence in the trial.\n\nProsecutors also intend to call witnesses from the gun shop to testify about the purchase of the revolver.\n\nWhat will Biden's defense argue?\n\nSo far, defense attorneys have unsuccessfully sought to toss the case using arguments that the charges are legally defective.\n\nAs trial looms, his attorneys have hinted at a defense that emphasizes the requirement that prosecutors show that Biden knowingly lied about his status as an unlawful drug user when he filled out paperwork to purchase the gun.\n\nAbbe Lowell, Biden's primary defense attorney, has sought permission to introduce at trial expert testimony from a specialist who can testify regarding a person with addiction's understanding of and state of denial about their own addiction.\n\n\"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict,\" Lowell wrote in court documents filed earlier this month.\n\nProsecutors have argued that Lowell submitted paperwork to admit that witness too late, asking the judge to bar such testimony.\n\nSecondarily, Lowell has hinted he may seek a line of questioning that attacks the credibility of the gun shop employees responsible for keeping the form on which Biden is accused of lying.\n\nThis avenue was opened by the fact that the form was altered between when it was first emailed to federal authorities in 2018 and when the original was turned over to federal investigators years later. Employees at the gun shop added another form of identification verification to the form after the fact that may not have actually been submitted by Biden, according to court documents.\n\nIn court, Lowell said the alteration calls the credibility of the shop employees to question and presents questions over whether the witnesses are obtaining a benefit from prosecutors since they appeared to have, like Biden, written false information on the form.\n\nWho will decide whether Biden is guilty?\n\nA jury of 12 picked from residents of New Castle County will evaluate the evidence and be tasked with rendering the verdict. Because of the high-profile nature of the defendant, hundreds are being called into the courthouse for jury selection on Monday.\n\nThe court will use pre-decided questions to cull potential jurors who can't be impartial down to a smaller pool. Then, prosecutors and defense attorneys will have the choice to strike a certain number of prospective jurors. This process could take days.\n\nWhere is this happening and how long will it take?\n\nAfter jury selection, each side will present opening statements and prosecutors will begin to call witnesses.\n\nProsecutors have said they expect to take three days to present their case. Lowell, Biden's attorney, indicated he will possibly also present a case and said if he does, it won't take double the time prosecutors have projected for their own.\n\nRecent: Hunter Biden appears in Wilmington court ahead of looming gun trial. Here's what happened\n\nIn all, the court expects the case to last about two weeks.\n\nThe trial will take place in the federal courthouse on King Street in downtown Wilmington.\n\nA piece of trivia: The court is housed in the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building, named after the former U.S. senator a young Joe Biden defeated in 1972 to launch his political career in Washington D.C.\n\nWho is the judge?\n\nFederal Judge Maryellen Noreika is presiding over the case.\n\nHer career before the bench centered on civil litigation: intellectual property cases and corporate litigation in federal and state courts. Later on, she'd gain experience representing children in Delaware's Family Court.\n\nIn 2017, Sens. Tom Carper and Chris Coons put forward Noreika and Colm F. Connolly to fill judicial vacancies in the Delaware District. Then-President Donald Trump nominated Noreika and Connolly, and she was confirmed the following year.\n\nThe Judge: Biden gun charges remain before judge who questioned plea deal, placing spotlight on her\n\nHer political affiliations and contributions have been mixed, according to past reporting.\n\nNoreika gained national attention last year when a plea deal for Biden fell apart under her pointed questioning of the parties. Both sides went into the hearing having agreed to a deal that would have resolved both the gun case, as well as pending tax charges against Biden with a misdemeanor plea and recommended sentence of probation only.\n\nFailed Plea Deal: Here's how Hunter Biden's expected plea deal fell apart, leading to his not guilty plea\n\nHowever, Noreika repeatedly complained that both parties wanted her \"rubber stamp\" on the \"unusual\" agreement and subjected them to hours of questions. Her line of inquiry ultimately exposed differences in each side's interpretation of the deal and led to her ordering further legal briefings that prompted the sides to abandon the deal.\n\nCould the president's son go to prison?\n\nThe charges carry a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison, though Biden is likely to get a shorter sentence if convicted. It is atypical for defendants to get a maximum sentence when they are first-time offenders like Biden.\n\nWhat about Biden's taxes?\n\nSeparately, Biden faces tax evasion charges in a California case now set to go to trial this fall.\n\nCali Case: Back-to-back Hunter Biden trial schedule gets spaced out as California judge delays\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Delaware News Journal: Historic Hunter Biden gun trial set for Monday: Here are the details.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Controlled substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Revolver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_202", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Route 202"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_State_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware State Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.38_Special", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": ".38 Special"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crack cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lowell, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lowell, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenville,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenville, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greenville, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Buhle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kathleen Buhle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryellen_Noreika", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maryellen Noreika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Caleb_Boggs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Biden was at the Delaware courthouse for a hearing days before he's expected to stand trial on federal firearms charges as his father's reelection campaign unfolds. President Joe Biden's son is charged with lying about his drug use in 2018 on a form to buy a gun he kept for about 11 days.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden's son was in federal court, prepared to plead guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses. The culmination of a sprawling investigation, the deal between Hunter Biden and prosecutors was going to spare him a politically explosive trial in the middle of his father's reelection campaign and likely prison time.\n\nBut it all fell apart.\n\nNow, Hunter Biden is headed to trial on federal gun charges in a case brought by his father's Justice Department at a time when America's political and legal worlds are colliding like never before. Dogged for years by investigations, scrutinized over his troubled personal life and vilified by Republicans, the younger Biden is now also confronting the threat of felony convictions and time behind bars.\n\nThe case opening Monday with jury selection in Delaware is not about Hunter Biden's business dealings, which have been the focus of the yearslong federal investigation and Republicans' fruitless impeachment inquiry into the Democratic president. It's about a gun Hunter Biden had for about 11 days -- a .38-caliber Colt Cobra Special. Prosecutors say he bought it illegally in October 2018 because he falsely swore on a federal form that he was not a drug user. He never fired the gun, according to his lawyers, and it ended up dumped in a trash can.\n\nThe trial will lack details about his foreign business matters that Republicans have seized on to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt, but it is expected to feature deeply personal and embarrassing testimony about dark time in the younger Biden's life. And it probably will provide new political impetus for Donald Trump's allies, who are eager to distract from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's own legal problems after he was convicted of 34 felony counts in his hush money trial.\n\nAllies of Joe Biden are worried about the toll the trial may take on the president, who already is concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as that son's darkest moments are relived in public. They also are worried that the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign while facing anemic poll numbers and is scheduled to prepare in Wilmington for a June 27 debate with Trump as the trial plays out nearby.\n\nTHE DEAL THAT NEVER WAS\n\nIt once looked like Hunter Biden was going to avoid prosecution in the gun case altogether.\n\nThe deal was announced last June. Nearly three years earlier, Hunter Biden had confirmed the federal investigation into his tax affairs in December 2020, shortly after his father was elected.\n\nThe younger Biden would have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses; prosecutors would have recommended two years of probation. There was also a \"diversion agreement\" that would have allowed him to escape prosecution on a felony gun charge as long he stayed out of trouble for two years.\n\nBut the plea hearing quickly unraveled.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, quizzed both sides with concerns about the deal. To her, it seemed unusual and required her to be involved in the case in a way most federal judges are not. The lawyers huddled, trying to salvage the deal. At one point they could be heard yelling at each other.\n\n\"Well, we'll just rip it up!\" Chris Clark, Biden's then-attorney, shouted as tempers flared.\n\n\"So what do we do now?\" the judge later asked the lawyers.\n\n\"Then there is no deal,\" prosecutor Leo Wise told her.\n\nA few weeks later, Attorney General Merrick Garland named David Weiss, the Trump-nominated U.S. attorney in Delaware who was leading the investigation, as a special counsel.\n\nHunter Biden was indicted a month after that on three gun counts. They are punishable by up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.\n\nCOURTROOM TENSION\n\nThe bitterness between prosecutors and Hunter Biden's legal team is glaring. It's likely to be on display Monday.\n\nClark withdrew from the case, saying he might be called to testify in a potential legal dispute over the now-defunct deal. Another defense lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has accused Weiss of caving to political pressure to indict the president's son after Trump and other Republicans blasted the \"sweetheart deal.\" The defense has noted that charges related to gun possession by drug users are rare when not in connection with a more serious crime.\n\n\"Mr. Biden is not being prosecuted for any sin that DOJ (the Department of Justice) believes he has committed. He is being punished for the perceived sins of his father -- the sin of opposing Mr. Trump's election to the president,\" according to court papers filed by Lowell, who also has represented Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the former president's daughter and son-in-law.\n\nProsecutors say Lowell's contention is \"fiction designed for a Hollywood script.\"\n\n\"Contrary to his assertion, he has not established that the Special Counsel, appointed by and serving at the pleasure of President Biden and his Attorney General, is punishing the defendant 'for the perceived sins of his father' in order to capitulate to a former President because of his tweets,\" Weiss' team responded.\n\nWeiss has said \"political considerations\" played no part in the investigation. He told lawmakers behind closed doors last year that that no one at the Justice Department prevented him from pursuing charges or taking other necessary steps, disputing claims from two IRS whistleblowers that the department improperly interfered in the tax investigation.\n\nA DARK TIME\n\nThe case stems from a period where, by his own admission, Hunter Biden was addicted to crack.\n\nIn his memoir \"Beautiful Things,\" he described becoming consumed by drugs and alcohol after his older brother, Beau, died in 2015 at age 46 from brain cancer. The brothers were very close, having survived a car crash when they were young that killed their mother and baby sister.\n\nHunter Biden has said he has been sober since 2019. But prosecutors intend to use his memoir to make the case that he knew he was addicted to drugs when he denied it on the form that every person must fill out when buying a gun. They plan to show jurors text messages, videos and photos of Hunter Biden smoking crack, as well details about cocaine residue that authorities say was found on the pouch he used to hold his gun.\n\n\"I'm a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I've ruined every relationship I've ever cherished,\" Hunter Biden wrote in one text message weeks after he bought the firearm, according to prosecutors.\n\nJurors are expected to hear testimony from his ex-wife and other former romantic partners, including Beau's widow, Hallie Biden, with whom Hunter Biden had a relationship after his brother's death. Hallie Biden found the gun in Hunter Biden's truck and threw it in a trash. It was found by a man collecting recyclables who gave it to the police.\n\nThe defense has suggested it will attack the credibility of the gun shop employees, noting there were changes to the gun-purchase form after the sale. Prosecutors say there were minor additions unrelated to the parts Hunter Biden filled out. His lawyers have suggested they may argue that Hunter Biden did not see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form.\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" the defense wrote in a recent filing. \"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nThe case is expected to last a couple of weeks. He also is scheduled to stand trial in September in California in the case where he is accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over four years.\n\nAssociated Press writer Colleen in

President Biden is returning to Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden's son was in federal court, prepared to plead guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses. The culmination of a sprawling investigation, the deal between Hunter Biden and prosecutors was going to spare him a politically explosive trial in the middle of his father's reelection campaign and likely prison time.\n\nBut it all fell apart.\n\nNow, Hunter Biden is headed to trial on federal gun charges in a case brought by his father's Justice Department at a time when America's political and legal worlds are colliding like never before. Dogged for years by investigations, scrutinized over his troubled personal life and vilified by Republicans, the younger Biden is now also confronting the threat of felony convictions and time behind bars.\n\nThe case opening Monday with jury selection in Delaware is not about Hunter Biden's business dealings, which have been the focus of the yearslong federal investigation and Republicans' fruitless impeachment inquiry into the Democratic president. It's about a gun Hunter Biden had for about 11 days -- a .38-caliber Colt Cobra Special. Prosecutors say he bought it illegally in October 2018 because he falsely swore on a federal form that he was not a drug user. He never fired the gun, according to his lawyers, and it ended up dumped in a trash can.\n\nThe trial will lack details about his foreign business matters that Republicans have seized on to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt, but it is expected to feature deeply personal and embarrassing testimony about dark time in the younger Biden's life. And it probably will provide new political impetus for Donald Trump's allies, who are eager to distract from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's own legal problems after he was convicted of 34 felony counts in his hush money trial.\n\nAllies of Joe Biden are worried about the toll the trial may take on the president, who already is concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as that son's darkest moments are relived in public. They also are worried that the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign while facing anemic poll numbers and is scheduled to prepare in Wilmington for a June 27 debate with Trump as the trial plays out nearby.\n\nTHE DEAL THAT NEVER WAS\n\nIt once looked like Hunter Biden was going to avoid prosecution in the gun case altogether.\n\nThe deal was announced last June. Nearly three years earlier, Hunter Biden had confirmed the federal investigation into his tax affairs in December 2020, shortly after his father was elected.\n\nThe younger Biden would have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses; prosecutors would have recommended two years of probation. There was also a \"diversion agreement\" that would have allowed him to escape prosecution on a felony gun charge as long he stayed out of trouble for two years.\n\nBut the plea hearing quickly unraveled.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, quizzed both sides with concerns about the deal. To her, it seemed unusual and required her to be involved in the case in a way most federal judges are not. The lawyers huddled, trying to salvage the deal. At one point they could be heard yelling at each other.\n\n\"Well, we'll just rip it up!\" Chris Clark, Biden's then-attorney, shouted as tempers flared.\n\nA few weeks later, Attorney General Merrick Garland named David Weiss, the Trump-nominated U.S. attorney in Delaware who was leading the investigation, as a special counsel.\n\nHunter Biden was indicted a month after that on three gun counts. They are punishable by up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.\n\nCOURTROOM TENSION\n\nThe bitterness between prosecutors and Hunter Biden's legal team is glaring. It's likely to be on display Monday.\n\nClark withdrew from the case, saying he might be called to testify in a potential legal dispute over the now-defunct deal. Another defense lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has accused Weiss of caving to political pressure to indict the president's son after Trump and other Republicans blasted the \"sweetheart deal.\" The defense has noted that charges related to gun possession by drug users are rare when not in connection with a more serious crime.\n\n\"Mr. Biden is not being prosecuted for any sin that DOJ (the Department of Justice) believes he has committed. He is being punished for the perceived sins of his father -- the sin of opposing Mr. Trump's election to the president,\" according to court papers filed by Lowell, who also has represented Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the former president's daughter and son-in-law.\n\nProsecutors say Lowell's contention is \"fiction designed for a Hollywood script.\"\n\n\"Contrary to his assertion, he has not established that the Special Counsel, appointed by and serving at the pleasure of President Biden and his Attorney General, is punishing the defendant 'for the perceived sins of his father' in order to capitulate to a former President because of his tweets,\" Weiss' team responded.\n\nWeiss has said \"political considerations\" played no part in the investigation. He told lawmakers behind closed doors last year that that no one at the Justice Department prevented him from pursuing charges or taking other necessary steps, disputing claims from two IRS whistleblowers that the department improperly interfered in the tax investigation.\n\nA DARK TIME\n\nThe case stems from a period where, by his own admission, Hunter Biden was addicted to crack.\n\nIn his memoir \"Beautiful Things,\" he described becoming consumed by drugs and alcohol after his older brother, Beau, died in 2015 at age 46 from brain cancer. The brothers were very close, having survived a car crash when they were young that killed their mother and baby sister.\n\nHunter Biden has said he has been sober since 2019. But prosecutors intend to use his memoir to make the case that he knew he was addicted to drugs when he denied it on the form that every person must fill out when buying a gun. They plan to show jurors text messages, videos and photos of Hunter Biden smoking crack, as well details about cocaine residue that authorities say was found on the pouch he used to hold his gun.\n\n\"I'm a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I've ruined every relationship I've ever cherished,\" Hunter Biden wrote in one text message weeks after he bought the firearm, according to prosecutors.\n\nJurors are expected to hear testimony from his ex-wife and other former romantic partners, including Beau's widow, Hallie Biden, with whom Hunter Biden had a relationship after his brother's death. Hallie Biden found the gun in Hunter Biden's truck and threw it in a trash. It was found by a man collecting recyclables who gave it to the police.\n\nThe defense has suggested it will attack the credibility of the gun shop employees, noting there were changes to the gun-purchase form after the sale. Prosecutors say there were minor additions unrelated to the parts Hunter Biden filled out. His lawyers have suggested they may argue that Hunter Biden did not see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form.\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" the defense wrote in a recent filing. \"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nThe case is expected to last a couple of weeks. He also is scheduled to stand trial in September in California in the case where he is accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over four years.\n\n_____\n\nAssociated Press writer

(AP Photo/Matt Slocum)\n\nPresident Joe Biden's son Hunter arrived at court on Monday for jury selection in a federal gun case against him after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden arrived shortly after, entering the courthouse in support of her son.\n\nJoe Biden said that as president he wouldn't comment on the criminal trial but as a dad he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said in a statement. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first at the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court to support him.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type":

First lady Jill Biden arrived shortly after, entering the courthouse in support of her son.\n\nJoe Biden said that as president he wouldn't comment on the criminal trial but as a dad he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said in a statement. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first at the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court to support him.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.", "source": {"uri": "firstcoastnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTLV 12 - Jacksonville"}, "authors": [{"uri": "assets@firstcoastnews.com", "name": "assets",

The culmination of a sprawling investigation, the deal between Hunter Biden and prosecutors was going to spare him a politically explosive trial in the middle of his father's reelection campaign and likely prison time.\n\nBut it all fell apart.\n\nNow, Hunter Biden is headed to trial on federal gun charges in a case brought by his father's Justice Department at a time when America's political and legal worlds are colliding like never before. Dogged for years by investigations, scrutinized over his troubled personal life and vilified by Republicans, the younger Biden is now also confronting the threat of felony convictions and time behind bars.\n\nThe case opening Monday with jury selection in Delaware is not about Hunter Biden's business dealings, which have been the focus of the yearslong federal investigation and Republicans' fruitless impeachment inquiry into the Democratic president. It's about a gun Hunter Biden had for about 11 days -- a .38-caliber Colt Cobra Special. Prosecutors say he bought it illegally in October 2018 because he falsely swore on a federal form that he was not a drug user. He never fired the gun, according to his lawyers, and it ended up dumped in a trash can.\n\nThe trial will lack details about his foreign business matters that Republicans have seized on to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt, but it is expected to feature deeply personal and embarrassing testimony about dark time in the younger Biden's life. And it probably will provide new political impetus for Donald Trump's allies, who are eager to distract from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's own legal problems after he was convicted of 34 felony counts in his hush money trial.\n\nAllies of Joe Biden are worried about the toll the trial may take on the president, who already is concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as that son's darkest moments are relived in public. They also are worried that the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign while facing anemic poll numbers and is scheduled to prepare in Wilmington for a June 27 debate with Trump as the trial plays out nearby.\n\nTHE DEAL THAT NEVER WAS\n\nIt once looked like Hunter Biden was going to avoid prosecution in the gun case altogether.\n\nThe deal was announced last June. Nearly three years earlier, Hunter Biden had confirmed the federal investigation into his tax affairs in December 2020, shortly after his father was elected.\n\nThe younger Biden would have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses; prosecutors would have recommended two years of probation. There was also a \"diversion agreement\" that would have allowed him to escape prosecution on a felony gun charge as long he stayed out of trouble for two years.\n\nBut the plea hearing quickly unraveled.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, quizzed both sides with concerns about the deal. To her, it seemed unusual and required her to be involved in the case in a way most federal judges are not. The lawyers huddled, trying to salvage the deal. At one point they could be heard yelling at each other.\n\n\"Well, we'll just rip it up!\" Chris Clark, Biden's then-attorney, shouted as tempers flared.\n\n\"So what do we do now?\" the judge later asked the lawyers.\n\n\"Then there is no deal,\" prosecutor Leo Wise told her.\n\nA few weeks later, Attorney General Merrick Garland named David Weiss, the Trump-nominated U.S. attorney in Delaware who was leading the investigation, as a special counsel.\n\nHunter Biden was indicted a month after that on three gun counts. They are punishable by up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.\n\nCOURTROOM TENSION\n\nThe bitterness between prosecutors and Hunter Biden's legal team is glaring. It's likely to be on display Monday.\n\nClark withdrew from the case, saying he might be called to testify in a potential legal dispute over the now-defunct deal. Another defense lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has accused Weiss of caving to political pressure to indict the president's son after Trump and other Republicans blasted the \"sweetheart deal.\" The defense has noted that charges related to gun possession by drug users are rare when not in connection with a more serious crime.\n\n\"Mr. Biden is not being prosecuted for any sin that DOJ (the Department of Justice) believes he has committed. He is being punished for the perceived sins of his father -- the sin of opposing Mr. Trump's election to the president,\" according to court papers filed by Lowell, who also has represented Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the former president's daughter and son-in-law.\n\nProsecutors say Lowell's contention is \"fiction designed for a Hollywood script.\"\n\n\"Contrary to his assertion, he has not established that the Special Counsel, appointed by and serving at the pleasure of President Biden and his Attorney General, is punishing the defendant 'for the perceived sins of his father' in order to capitulate to a former President because of his tweets,\" Weiss' team responded.\n\nWeiss has said \"political considerations\" played no part in the investigation. He told lawmakers behind closed doors last year that that no one at the Justice Department prevented him from pursuing charges or taking other necessary steps, disputing claims from two IRS whistleblowers that the department improperly interfered in the tax investigation.\n\nA DARK TIME\n\nThe case stems from a period where, by his own admission, Hunter Biden was addicted to crack.\n\nIn his memoir \"Beautiful Things,\" he described becoming consumed by drugs and alcohol after his older brother, Beau, died in 2015 at age 46 from brain cancer. The brothers were very close, having survived a car crash when they were young that killed their mother and baby sister.\n\nHunter Biden has said he has been sober since 2019. But prosecutors intend to use his memoir to make the case that he knew he was addicted to drugs when he denied it on the form that every person must fill out when buying a gun. They plan to show jurors text messages, videos and photos of Hunter Biden smoking crack, as well details about cocaine residue that authorities say was found on the pouch he used to hold his gun.\n\n\"I'm a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I've ruined every relationship I've ever cherished,\" Hunter Biden wrote in one text message weeks after he bought the firearm, according to prosecutors.\n\nJurors are expected to hear testimony from his ex-wife and other former romantic partners, including Beau's widow, Hallie Biden, with whom Hunter Biden had a relationship after his brother's death. Hallie Biden found the gun in Hunter Biden's truck and threw it in a trash. It was found by a man collecting recyclables who gave it to the police.\n\nThe defense has suggested it will attack the credibility of the gun shop employees, noting there were changes to the gun-purchase form after the sale. Prosecutors say there were minor additions unrelated to the parts Hunter Biden filled out. His lawyers have suggested they may argue that Hunter Biden did not see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form.\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" the defense wrote in a recent filing. \"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nThe case is expected to last a couple of weeks. He also is scheduled to stand trial in September in California in the case where he is accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over four years.\n\n_____\n\nAssociated Press writer Colleen in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

First lady Jill Biden was seated in the front row of the courtroom, in a show of support for her son.\n\nIn a statement, the president said that as a dad he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she will ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first to the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court to support him. The president was at their Wilmington home until he left later in the day for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors hope to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack.

First lady Jill Biden entered the courthouse shortly after.\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office.

(AP) -- A federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter opened Monday with jury selection, following the collapse of a plea deal that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden was seated in the front row of the courtroom, in a show of support for her son.\n\nIn a statement, the president said he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nRoughly two dozen prospective jurors who answered \"yes\" on a questionnaire were quizzed individually by Judge Maryellen Noreika to determine whether they could be fair and impartial.\n\nThe questions ranged from their knowledge of the case, thoughts about gun ownership and whether they or anyone close to them have struggled with substance abuse or addiction or ever owned a gun.\n\nOne prospective juror said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she replied when an attorney asked what her opinion was. About half were dismissed.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first to the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court to support him. The president was at their Wilmington home until he left later in the day for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors hope to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They will also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nLong reported from Washington.

(AP) -- A federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter opened Monday with jury selection, following the collapse of a plea deal that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden was seated in the front row of the courtroom, in a show of support for her son.\n\nIn a statement, the president said that as a dad he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she will ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first to the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court to support him. The president was at their Wilmington home until he left later in the day for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors hope to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

He has pleaded not guilty. It is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California.\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden, Hunter Biden's wife Melissa Cohen Biden and his half-sister Ashley Biden were in attendance at the trial in Wilmington, before US District Judge Maryellen Noreika.\n\n\"Jill and I love our son and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" Joe Biden said in a statement, adding that a lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction.\n\nTrump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York on Thursday of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 US election that put him in the White House. Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the Nov. 5 US election.\n\nRead also: Trump says Americans could reach 'breaking point' if he is jailed\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.\n\nIn the case brought by US Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, last September Hunter Biden was charged with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018. Weiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the US Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday. The president, who had been expected to depart Rehoboth Beach on Monday, travelled on Sunday evening to his home in Wilmington.\n\nPotential jurors\n\nNoreika began screening potential jurors for their ability to commit to serving the length of the trial, which is expected to run through the end of next week.\n\n\"Do you think you can put aside your views on gun ownership,\" she asked a potential juror, who responded that she could be impartial.\n\nOther potential jurors were asked about addiction, convictions and run-ins with law enforcement.\n\nAll 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nUS first lady Jill Biden arrives at the federal court on the opening day of trial of Hunter Biden, son of US President Joe Biden, on criminal gun charges in Wilmington, Delaware, US, June 3, 2024. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nThe case is expected to centre on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nProsecution lawyers revealed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter Biden's phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers. They said they may call as a witness his former wife Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they may try to show he had completed a drug rehabilitation program before purchasing the gun and may have considered his answer on the gun purchase form to be truthful.\n\nA plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Biden. Hunter Biden's lawyers blamed Republican pressure for the failure of the plea agreement.\n\nRead: Biden's son Hunter indicted on gun charges\n\nNoreika entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.\n\nThat testimony could have helped Biden show that he did not know he was lying on the background check form. The government is required to prove that Biden knowingly lied.\n\nCongressional Republicans spent years in vain trying to find evidence of a corrupt link between Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, including work for Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and his father's political power.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors":

First lady Jill Biden was seated in the front row of the courtroom, in a show of support for her son.\n\nIn a statement, the president said that as a dad he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she will ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first to the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court to support him. The president was at their Wilmington home until he left later in the day for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors hope to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

AP Photo/Matt Slocum\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. -- A federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter opened Monday with jury selection, following the collapse of a plea deal that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden was seated in the front row of the courtroom, in a show of support for her son.\n\nIn a statement, the president said he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoughly two dozen prospective jurors who answered \"yes\" on a questionnaire were quizzed individually by Judge Maryellen Noreika to determine whether they could be fair and impartial.\n\nThe questions ranged from their knowledge of the case, thoughts about gun ownership and whether they or anyone close to them have struggled with substance abuse or addiction or ever owned a gun.\n\nOne prospective juror said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she replied when an attorney asked what her opinion was. About half were dismissed.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first to the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court to support him. The president was at their Wilmington home until he left later in the day for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors hope to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They will also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

A jury found the former President guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign.

Biden attorneys are expected in court Friday, May 24, days before the president's son is expected to stand trial on federal firearms charges in Delaware as his father's reelection campaign unfolds. Biden is charged with lying about his drug use in October 2018 on a form to buy a gun that he kept for about 11 days in Delaware.\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Jury selection is to begin Monday in a federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election.\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his father, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of Hunter Biden at https://apnews.com/hub/hunter-biden.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley

Matt Rourke/Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Biden's son was in federal court, prepared to plead guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses. The culmination of a sprawling investigation, the deal between Hunter Biden and prosecutors was going to spare him a politically explosive trial in the middle of his father's reelection campaign and likely prison time.\n\nBut it all fell apart.\n\nNow, Hunter Biden is headed to trial on federal gun charges in a case brought by his father's Justice Department at a time when America's political and legal worlds are colliding like never before. Dogged for years by investigations, scrutinized over his troubled personal life and vilified by Republicans, the younger Biden is now also confronting the threat of felony convictions and time behind bars.\n\nRelated Hunter Biden rebuffs Republicans' invitation to appear for a public hearing\n\nThe case opening Monday with jury selection in Delaware is not about Hunter Biden's business dealings, which have been the focus of the yearslong federal investigation and Republicans' fruitless impeachment inquiry into the Democratic president. It's about a gun Hunter Biden had for about 11 days - a .38-caliber Colt Cobra Special. Prosecutors say he bought it illegally in October 2018 because he falsely swore on a federal form that he was not a drug user. He never fired the gun, according to his lawyers, and it ended up dumped in a trash can.\n\nThe trial will lack details about his foreign business matters that Republicans have seized on to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt, but it is expected to feature deeply personal and embarrassing testimony about dark time in the younger Biden's life. And it probably will provide new political impetus for Donald Trump's allies, who are eager to distract from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's own legal problems after he was convicted of 34 felony counts in his hush money trial.\n\nRelated Hunter Biden indicted on federal firearms charges in long-running probe weeks after plea deal failed\n\nAllies of Joe Biden are worried about the toll the trial may take on the president, who already is concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as that son's darkest moments are relived in public. They also are worried that the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign while facing anemic poll numbers and is scheduled to prepare in Wilmington for a June 27 debate with Trump as the trial plays out nearby.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHE DEAL THAT NEVER WAS\n\nIt once looked like Hunter Biden was going to avoid prosecution in the gun case altogether.\n\nThe deal was announced last June. Nearly three years earlier, Hunter Biden had confirmed the federal investigation into his tax affairs in December 2020, shortly after his father was elected.\n\nThe younger Biden would have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses; prosecutors would have recommended two years of probation. There was also a \"diversion agreement\" that would have allowed him to escape prosecution on a felony gun charge as long he stayed out of trouble for two years.\n\nBut the plea hearing quickly unraveled.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, quizzed both sides with concerns about the deal. To her, it seemed unusual and required her to be involved in the case in a way most federal judges are not. The lawyers huddled, trying to salvage the deal. At one point they could be heard yelling at each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Well, we'll just rip it up!\" Chris Clark, Biden's then-attorney, shouted as tempers flared.\n\n\"So what do we do now?\" the judge later asked the lawyers.\n\n\"Then there is no deal,\" prosecutor Leo Wise told her.\n\nA few weeks later, Attorney General Merrick Garland named David Weiss, the Trump-nominated U.S. attorney in Delaware who was leading the investigation, as a special counsel.\n\nHunter Biden was indicted a month after that on three gun counts. They are punishable by up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.\n\nCOURTROOM TENSION\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bitterness between prosecutors and Hunter Biden's legal team is glaring. It's likely to be on display Monday.\n\nClark withdrew from the case, saying he might be called to testify in a potential legal dispute over the now-defunct deal. Another defense lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has accused Weiss of caving to political pressure to indict the president's son after Trump and other Republicans blasted the \"sweetheart deal.\" The defense has noted that charges related to gun possession by drug users are rare when not in connection with a more serious crime.\n\n\"Mr. Biden is not being prosecuted for any sin that DOJ (the Department of Justice) believes he has committed. He is being punished for the perceived sins of his father - the sin of opposing Mr. Trump's election to the president,\" according to court papers filed by Lowell, who also has represented Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the former president's daughter and son-in-law.\n\nProsecutors say Lowell's contention is \"fiction designed for a Hollywood script.\"\n\n\"Contrary to his assertion, he has not established that the Special Counsel, appointed by and serving at the pleasure of President Biden and his Attorney General, is punishing the defendant 'for the perceived sins of his father' in order to capitulate to a former President because of his tweets,\" Weiss' team responded.\n\nWeiss has said \"political considerations\" played no part in the investigation. He told lawmakers behind closed doors last year that no one at the Justice Department prevented him from pursuing charges or taking other necessary steps, disputing claims from two IRS whistleblowers that the department improperly interfered in the tax investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA DARK TIME\n\nThe case stems from a period where, by his own admission, Hunter Biden was addicted to crack.\n\nIn his memoir \"Beautiful Things,\" he described becoming consumed by drugs and alcohol after his older brother, Beau, died in 2015 at age 46 from brain cancer. The brothers were very close, having survived a car crash when they were young that killed their mother and baby sister.\n\nHunter Biden has said he has been sober since 2019. But prosecutors intend to use his memoir to make the case that he knew he was addicted to drugs when he denied it on the form that every person must fill out when buying a gun. They plan to show jurors text messages, videos and photos of Hunter Biden smoking crack, as well as details about cocaine residue that authorities say was found on the pouch he used to hold his gun.\n\n\"I'm a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I've ruined every relationship I've ever cherished,\" Hunter Biden wrote in one text message weeks after he bought the firearm, according to prosecutors.\n\nJurors are expected to hear testimony from his ex-wife and other former romantic partners, including Beau's widow, Hallie Biden, with whom Hunter Biden had a relationship after his brother's death. Hallie Biden found the gun in Hunter Biden's truck and threw it in the trash. It was found by a man collecting recyclables who gave it to the police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe defense has suggested it will attack the credibility of the gun shop employees, noting there were changes to the gun purchase form after the sale. Prosecutors say there were minor additions unrelated to the parts Hunter Biden filled out. His lawyers have suggested they may argue that Hunter Biden did not see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form.\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" the defense wrote in a recent filing. \"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nThe case is expected to last a couple of weeks. He also is scheduled to stand trial in September in California in the case where he is accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over four years.\n\nAssociated Press writer Colleen in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines Hunter Biden attorney threatens litigation against Fox News Hunter Biden rebuffs Republicans' invitation to appear for a public hearing Hunter Biden indicted on federal firearms charges in long-running probe weeks after plea deal failed\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

In addition to Jill Biden, Hunter's wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, and a sister, Ashley Biden, are attending the first day of his trial on federal gun charges Monday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is not attending, but he changed his schedule to be in Wilmington for the first day of his son's trial. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" the president said in a statement. \"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us.\"\n\nThe trial comes four days after former President Donald Trump was found guilty of falsifying business records in New York, and after the stunning collapse of a plea deal with federal investigators last year.\n\nBiden is facing three firearm felonies, all of which focus on whether he lied on a federal gun form in 2018 that asked if he was addicted to drugs.\n\nTrial is expected to explore the depths of Biden's drug use and follow a bizarre series of events in which he purchased a gun that authorities recovered after it was thrown into a trash can in a Delaware grocery store weeks later.\n\nFollow along with the USA TODAY Network's live coverage as jury selection begins.\n\nHow long is the trial expected to last?\n\nHunter Biden's trial on federal gun charges in the family's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, could last more than two weeks.\n\nFederal prosecutors have said in court filings they will present photos, testimony and messages to show that Hunter Biden was an illegal drug user around the time he bought the gun and failed to disclose that as required on a federal gun purchase form.\n\nProsecutors also said they may use details gleaned from his phone, iCloud account and the infamous laptop that he allegedly abandoned at a repair store, including photos of Hunter Biden smoking crack and texts arranging meetings with illegal drug dealers.\n\n- Reuters\n\nMore: Hunter Biden bursts into public view: Here's how the president's son will play a central role in 2024\n\nWhat is Hunter Biden being charged with?\n\nThe president's son faces three firearms felonies.\n\nIn October 2018, Hunter Biden walked into a gun shop north of Wilmington, Delaware, and purchased a revolver. People who purchase firearms are required to fill out a standardized form that asks whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBut Biden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nBiden faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted, although first-time and non-violent offenders are often given shorter terms.\n\n- Xerxes Wilson\n\nMore: What is an addict? Hunter Biden is fighting what that means as gun trial looms\n\nSee the questions lawyers will ask potential Hunter Biden jurors\n\nHere are the 47 questions potenial jurors will be asked as Judge Maryellen Noreika looks for twelve impartial Delaware residents to take their seats at Hunter Biden's federal gun trial. The questionnaire gets to the heart of the unusual case involving the president's son, drug addiction and firearms. Among the questions:\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika began questioning potential jurors in Hunter Biden's trial on gun charges and explained rules for participating in the case, including not reading media coverage.\n\nShe aims to seat 12 jurors and four alternates.\n\nNoreika is asking potential jurors whether they can impartially review the evidence in the case. Questions include whether potential jurors know anyone involved in the case, along with general inquiries about their thoughts on politics, law enforcement and issues surrounding addiction.\n\nJurors who answer \"yes\" to one of the screening questions will be further questioned by the judge. Those interviews are occurring now. Out of the first pool of what was scheduled to be 50 potential jurors, only one did not answer \"yes\" to one of the screening questions, meaning this process will likely take a long time.\n\n-Xerxes Wilson\n\nPresident Joe Biden supports Hunter as trial begins\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued a statement Monday supporting his son as Hunter Biden's federal gun trial begins.\n\n\"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" Joe Biden said. \"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us.\"\n\nJoe Biden said he wouldn't comment as president on pending federal cases. But he said he has confidence in his son and respect for him.\n\n\"Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support,\" Joe Biden said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nHunter Biden also faces civil trial against his ex-wife over alimony\n\nHunter Biden isn't just facing sweeping legal problems over gun and tax charges. Axios reported last week that - in 2021 - a Washington court found he was in breach of an agreement with his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle. At the time, he owed her over $1.7 million in legal fees, spousal support and other costs from their 2017 divorce.\n\nSince then, Buhle and Biden's legal battle has continued, and her attorneys have argued he still owes her millions.\n\n- Marina Pitofsky\n\nHunter Biden's family stays close for federal trial\n\nHunter Biden's relatives stayed close for his trial on federal gun charges, with his father, President Biden, remaining in Wilmington on Sunday night for the start of jury selection Monday.\n\nHunter Biden arrived at court holding hands with his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden. His mother Jill and sister Ashley arrived separately. Hunter Biden's past drug use is at the heart of charges he lied on a federal form and to a gun dealer when buying a guy in 2018.\n\nThe two courtroom benches behind Hunter Biden and his defense team, where Jill and Ashley Biden were seated, were filled before the jury was called into the courtroom.\n\nMore: As Trump's trial nears an end, the Bidens prep for a month in legal purgatory\n\nThe family support contrasted slightly with the attendance at another high-profile trial, that of former President Donald Trump in New York. He was convicted Thursday of falsifying business records to cover up his role in a hush money payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.\n\nTrump's wife Melania, daughter Ivanka and son Barron Trump didn't attend the six-week trial. His sons Donald Junior and Eric attended occasionally, and daughter Tiffany Trump appeared for closing arguments.\n\n-Bart Jansen and Esteban Parra\n\nHunter Biden trial hunts for jurors without connections to famous family\n\nAs jury selection begins in Hunter Biden's trial on federal gun charges, one challenge will be finding jurors who don't have a connection to the first family in the First State.\n\n\"Good luck getting that jury,\" said Dori Jacobson, a Greenville resident who lives not far from President Biden's residence.\n\nHunter Biden's father, President Joe Biden, has been a ubiquitous presence since serving decades as a senator and then as vice president. Potential jurors won't be asked about interactions at Pep Boys, worshipping at St. Joseph on the Brandywine or watching his grandchildren's flag football games, but they will be asked about connections to the family.\n\n\"Are you, any member of your immediate family, or close friends acquaintances with Robert Hunter Biden or any member of his family?\" reads the seventh of 47 questions listed on the jury selection document.\n\n-Ryan Cormier\n\nMore: When everyone's met a Biden in Delaware, how hard will it be to find a jury?\n\nHunter Biden arrives at federal courthouse for trial on gun charges\n\nHunter Biden arrived about 8:10 a.m. Monday for the start of his trial on federal gun charges.\n\nMore: 'Karma' or 'political prosecution?' Voters weigh in on Hunter Biden criminal trials\n\nTrial's key moment: Was Hunter Biden sober on Oct. 12, 2018?\n\nA large part of Hunter Biden's trial will boil down to a single day in October 2018, when he bought a .38 Special revolver at a Delaware gun store and checked \"No\" on a federal gun form that asked about drug addiction or drug use.\n\nThe federal drug form asked: \"Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?\"\n\n\"At issue here is Mr. Biden's understanding of the question,\" his lawyer Abbe Lowell recently wrote the court. \"Someone like Mr. Biden, who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nSome drug treatment experts told USA TODAY they wouldn't consider a patient cured of addiction after 11 days of treatment. But they said a person who had just completed treatment might consider themselves sober.\n\nMore: Hunter Biden trial: Why his gun case hinges on one fateful day when he wasn't using drugs\n\nReporters arrive early for Hunter Biden trial\n\nBy 6:45 am, a dozen reporters had lined up outside the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building in downtown Wilmington for the start of Hunter Biden's will go on trial this week on federal gun charges.\n\nJury selection starts today, with court convening at 8:30 a.m. local time.\n\nThree tents for broadcast stations were set up near the court. A heavy police presence is visible, with several police cars parked along North King Street, which runs along one side the building.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security dog walked up and down the line of reporters, sniffing their bags.\n\nBoggs, the building's late namesake, was a former Republican governor who lost his Senate seat in a 1972 squeaker to Joe Biden.\n\nHunter Biden won't be able to introduce a second federal form during his trial on charges he illegally bought and possessed a gun while addicted to drugs, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika ruled Sunday.\n\nThe president's son is charged with lying on the form and lying to the gun dealer about his drug usage when he bought a .38-caliber pistol in 2018 and had it for 11 days.\n\nOn the initial form submitted to federal authorities soon after buying the gun, Biden put an X next to a question asking if he used narcotics or was addicted to them. The second version of the form was submitted to investigators in 2021 with additional information attached that said Biden submitted his vehicle registration when he bought the gun, which apparently wasn't the case, according to court statements.\n\nBiden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, sought to question the gun shop owner about the second form, arguing he apparently filled out the form inaccurately, which is the charge against Biden. But prosecutors argued the second form is \"irrelevant\" and would confuse jurors. Noreika agreed and barred the form from trial, in one of two rulings Sunday against the defense.\n\n-Xerxes Wilson\n\nMore: These are the people, places that will take center stage in Hunter Biden's trial\n\nJudge bars defense expert on drug addiction from trial\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika barred testimony from one of Hunter Biden's proposed expert witnesses, who the defense sought to give a perspective about how people suffering drug addiction view themselves.\n\nDefense lawyers sought to have Elie Aoun, an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry, to testify to testify about how people who have participated in rehabilitation programs are sometimes in denial about their addiction and view themselves as no longer addicted when they complete a program.\n\nBut Noreika barred the witness Sunday, in one of two decisions against the dense, by ruling the defense failed to provide prosecutors with a proper explanation about what expert opinions Aoun would offer.\n\nBiden's defense also sought testimony from Michael Coyer, a forensic toxicologist, to answer questions about items including a white residue on a brown leather gun pouch that tested positive for cocaine years after it was taken into police custody. Noreika ruled that she would hear from Coyer without the jury present before deciding whether to allow him to testify.\n\nThe first two relate specifically to the form he filled out to purchase a gun in 2018, accusing Biden of lying about this drug use on the form.\n\nThe third charge pertains to Biden's possession of a firearm while he was allegedly an unlawful user or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nThe charges carry a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison, though Biden is likely to get a shorter sentence if convicted. It is atypical for defendants to get a maximum sentence when they are first-time offenders like Biden.", "source": {"uri": "courier-journal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Courier-Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_possession_of_a_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Criminal possession of a weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Cohen_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Cohen Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ashley Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryellen_Noreika", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maryellen Noreika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revolver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crack cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alimony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alimony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Caleb_Boggs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

(AP) -- President Joe Biden's son Hunter arrived at court on Monday for jury selection in a federal gun case against him after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden arrived shortly after, entering the courthouse in support of her son.\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first at the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nLong reported from Washington.

(AP) -- President Joe Biden's son Hunter arrived at court on Monday for jury selection in a federal gun case against him after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden arrived shortly after, entering the courthouse in support of her son.\n\nJoe Biden said that as president he wouldn't comment on the criminal trial but as a dad he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said in a statement. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first at the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court to support him.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

He has pleaded not guilty. It is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California.\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden, Hunter Biden's wife Melissa Cohen Biden and his half-sister Ashley Biden were in attendance at the trial in Wilmington, before US District Judge Maryellen Noreika.\n\n\"Jill and I love our son and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" Joe Biden said in a statement, adding that a lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction.\n\nTrump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York on Thursday of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 US election that put him in the White House. Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the November 5 US election.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.\n\nIn the case brought by US Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, last September Hunter Biden was charged with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018. Weiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the US Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday. The president, who had been expected to depart Rehoboth Beach on Monday, traveled on Sunday evening to his home in Wilmington.\n\nNoreika began screening potential jurors for their ability to commit to serving the length of the trial, which is expected to run through the end of next week.\n\n\"Do you think you can put aside your views on gun ownership,\" she asked a potential juror, who responded that she could be impartial.\n\nOther potential jurors were asked about addiction, convictions and run-ins with law enforcement.\n\nAll 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nThe case is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nProsecution lawyers revealed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter Biden's phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers. They said they may call as a witness his former wife Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they may try to show he had completed a drug rehabilitation program before purchasing the gun and may have considered his answer on the gun purchase form to be truthful.\n\nA plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Biden. Hunter Biden's lawyers blamed Republican pressure for the failure of the plea agreement.\n\nNoreika entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.\n\nThat testimony could have helped Biden show that he did not know he was lying on the background check form. The government is required to prove that Biden knowingly lied.\n\nCongressional Republicans spent years in vain trying to find evidence of a corrupt link between Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, including work for Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and his father's political power.", "source": {"uri": "english.jagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jagran English"}, "authors":

He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved.

This case, involving claims of lying about drug use, is significant as it's the first trial of a sitting president's child. Hunter, who pleaded not guilty, faces up to 25 years if convicted.\n\nThe criminal trial of Hunter Biden kicked off on Monday in federal court in Delaware as President Joe Biden's son faces gun charges in a historic case that begins four days after Donald Trump became the first former U.S. president to be convicted.\n\nHunter Biden, 54, arrived at the courthouse for the first trial of the child of a sitting president, in which he will face three felony charges stemming from his purchase and possession of a revolver in 2018. He has pleaded not guilty. It is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California. First Lady Jill Biden, Hunter Biden's wife Melissa Cohen Biden and his half-sister Ashley Biden were in attendance at the trial in Wilmington, before U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika.\n\n\"Jill and I love our son and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" Joe Biden said in a statement, adding that a lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction. Trump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York on Thursday of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House. Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases. In the case brought by U.S. Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, last September Hunter Biden was charged with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018. Weiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department. Hunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday. The president, who had been expected to depart Rehoboth Beach on Monday, traveled on Sunday evening to his home in Wilmington.\n\nPOTENTIAL JURORS Noreika began screening potential jurors for their ability to commit to serving the length of the trial, which is expected to run through the end of next week.\n\n\"Do you think you can put aside your views on gun ownership,\" she asked a potential juror, who responded that she could be impartial. Other potential jurors were asked about addiction, convictions and run-ins with law enforcement.\n\nAll 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict. The case is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance. Prosecution lawyers revealed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter Biden's phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers. They said they may call as a witness his former wife Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they may try to show he had completed a drug rehabilitation program before purchasing the gun and may have considered his answer on the gun purchase form to be truthful. A plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Biden. Hunter Biden's lawyers blamed Republican pressure for the failure of the plea agreement.\n\nNoreika entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy. The judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.\n\nThat testimony could have helped Biden show that he did not know he was lying on the background check form. The government is required to prove that Biden knowingly lied. Congressional Republicans spent years in vain trying to find evidence of a corrupt link between Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, including work for Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and his father's political power.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

(AP) -- President Joe Biden's son Hunter arrived at court on Monday for jury selection in a federal gun case against him after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden arrived shortly after, entering the courthouse in support of her son.\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first at the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nLong reported from Washington.

He has pleaded not guilty. It is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California.\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden, Hunter Biden's wife Melissa Cohen Biden and his half-sister Ashley Biden were in attendance at the trial in Wilmington, before US District Judge Maryellen Noreika.\n\n\"Jill and I love our son and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" Joe Biden said in a statement, adding that a lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction.\n\nTrump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York on Thursday of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 US election that put him in the White House. Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the Nov. 5 US election.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.\n\nIn the case brought by US Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, last September Hunter Biden was charged with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018. Weiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the US Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday. The president, who had been expected to depart Rehoboth Beach on Monday, travelled on Sunday evening to his home in Wilmington.\n\nNoreika began screening potential jurors for their ability to commit to serving the length of the trial, which is expected to run through the end of next week.\n\n\"Do you think you can put aside your views on gun ownership,\" she asked a potential juror, who responded that she could be impartial.\n\nOther potential jurors were asked about addiction, convictions and run-ins with law enforcement.\n\nAll 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nThe case is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nProsecution lawyers revealed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter Biden's phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers. They said they may call as a witness his former wife Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they may try to show he had completed a drug rehabilitation program before purchasing the gun and may have considered his answer on the gun purchase form to be truthful.\n\nA plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Biden. Hunter Biden's lawyers blamed Republican pressure for the failure of the plea agreement.\n\nNoreika entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.\n\nThat testimony could have helped Biden show that he did not know he was lying on the background check form. The government is required to prove that Biden knowingly lied.\n\nCongressional Republicans spent years in vain trying to find evidence of a corrupt link between Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, including work for Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and his father's political power.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

(AP) -- A federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter opened Monday with jury selection, following the collapse of a plea deal that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden was seated in the front row of the courtroom, in a show of support for her son.\n\nIn a statement, the president said that as a dad he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she will ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first to the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court to support him. The president was at their Wilmington home until he left later in the day for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors hope to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\n___\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nLong reported from Washington.

First lady Jill Biden was seated in the front row of the courtroom, in a show of support for her son.\n\nIn a statement, the president said he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants by saying he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nIn Delaware, prospective jurors who answered \"yes\" on a questionnaire were quizzed individually by Judge Maryellen Noreika to determine whether they could be fair and impartial. One by one, they were dismissed, winnowing down the pool.\n\nThe questions ranged from their knowledge of the case to their thoughts about gun ownership and whether they or anyone close to them have struggled with substance abuse or addiction or ever owned a gun. Other questions focused on the role politics may have played in the charges.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden arrives ahead of Hunter Biden's trial at federal court, Monday, June 3, 2024, in Wilmington, Del. (Matt Slocum / AP Photo)\n\nOne prospective juror said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she replied when an attorney asked her opinion. Another prospective juror was dismissed because his family has a long history in law enforcement, and he said he could not be impartial. A third was excused because he was very aware of the case, and, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nOnly one potential juror answered \"no\" to all the questions and moved on to the next phase. Another who was not dismissed said he holds a concealed carry permit and owns three handguns. The man said he has strong views on gun ownership and believes every law-abiding citizen should be able to own a gun.\n\n\"I believe the Second Amendment is very important,\" he explained.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay US$1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first to the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court, and his wife Melissa. The president in Wilmington until he left for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form.

(AP) -- President Joe Biden's son Hunter arrived at court on Monday for jury selection in a federal gun case against him after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden arrived shortly after, entering the courthouse in support of her son.\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction.

They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

The criminal trial of Hunter Biden kicked off on Monday in federal court in Delaware as President Joe Biden's son faces gun charges in a historic case that begins four days after Donald Trump became the first former US president to be convicted.\n\nHunter Biden, 54, arrived at the courthouse for the first trial of the child of a sitting president, in which he will face three felony charges stemming from his purchase and possession of a revolver in 2018.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty. It is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California.\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden, Hunter Biden's wife Melissa Cohen Biden and his half-sister Ashley Biden were in attendance at the trial in Wilmington, before US District Judge Maryellen Noreika.\n\n\"Jill and I love our son and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" Joe Biden said in a statement, adding that a lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction.\n\nTrump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York on Thursday of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 US.\n\nelection that put him in the White House. Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the November 5 US election.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles.\n\nTrump is due to be sentenced on July 11.\n\nRead: Donald Trump found guilty on all counts in 'hush money' trial ahead of his nomination\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.\n\nIn the case brought by US Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, last September Hunter Biden was charged with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018.\n\nWeiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges.If convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the US Justice Department.Hunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday.\n\nThe president, who had been expected to depart Rehoboth Beach on Monday, traveled on Sunday evening to his home in Wilmington.\n\nPotential jurors\n\nNoreika began screening potential jurors for their ability to commit to serving the length of the trial, which is expected to run through the end of next week.\n\n\"Do you think you can put aside your views on gun ownership,\" she asked a potential juror, who responded that she could be impartial.\n\nOther potential jurors were asked about addiction, convictions and run-ins with law enforcement.\n\nAll 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nThe case is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nProsecution lawyers revealed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter Biden's phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers.\n\nThey said they may call as a witness his former wife Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes\n\n.Hunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they may try to show he had completed a drug rehabilitation program before purchasing the gun and may have considered his answer on the gun purchase form to be truthful.\n\nA plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Biden.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers blamed Republican pressure for the failure of the plea agreement.\n\nNoreika entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.\n\nThat testimony could have helped Biden show that he did not know he was lying on the background check form.\n\nThe government is required to prove that Biden knowingly lied.Congressional Republicans spent years in vain trying to find evidence of a corrupt link between Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, including work for Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and his father's political power.", "source": {"uri": "thecitizen.co.tz", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Citizen"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

(AP) -- President Joe Biden's son Hunter arrived at court on Monday for jury selection in a federal gun case against him after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden entered the courthouse shortly after.\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of Hunter Biden at https://apnews.com/hub/hunter-biden.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000.

Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in the US state of Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction.\n\nHe has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nBiden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he is being unfairly targeted by the US justice department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City.\n\nA jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underlines how the criminal courtroom has taken centre stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes.\n\nBoth cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a years-long investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Mr Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanour offences to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart.\n\nUS attorney general Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who has long been concerned about the wellbeing and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinised.\n\nHe is also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his father and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the US president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first at the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by US secret service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court to support him.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anaemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they are planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved.\n\nThe contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which Hunter Biden was often nude and doing drugs, and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office.\n\nShe will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nThe judge is also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she will ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including the question: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\" - AP", "source":

The second prosecution is on tax charges and is scheduled to go to trial in September in California.\n\nHunter Biden faces three counts in the gun case: two false statements for allegedly lying about his drug use when purchasing a firearm, and one for the unlawful possession of a gun by a drug user or addict. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe trial is the latest courtroom drama of this election year to hold potential political implications for the 2024 presidential race.\n\nAlthough Hunter Biden is not running for public office, Republicans have long sought to use his legal troubles and foreign business dealings to try to damage his father politically. The trial provides a fresh opportunity to do so.\n\nIt comes just days after his father's opponent in the 2024 election, former President Donald Trump, was found guilty by a New York jury of falsifying business records of hush money payments made to an adult film star.\n\nThe gun case is rooted in a difficult period in Hunter Biden's life when he was reeling after the death of his brother, Beau, and was addicted to crack cocaine and alcohol. The trial is expected to dredge up deeply personal episodes for Hunter Biden and the toll is took on the Biden family.\n\nThe case centers on a Colt Cobra revolver Hunter Biden bought at a Wilmington gun store in October 2018. Prosecutors say that Biden lied on a standard background check form when buying the gun by declaring that he was not using or addicted to illegal drugs.\n\nProsecutors say they intend to call around a dozen witnesses, including Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, and his brother's widow, Hallie Biden, who was romantically involved with Hunter Biden after Beau's death.\n\nIt was Hallie Biden who found the gun and threw it into a dumpster outside a Wilmington market less than two weeks after Hunter purchased the weapon. The gun was later found by a man collecting recyclables, who alerted law enforcement.\n\nProsecutors also intend to use excerpts from Hunter Biden's memoir, in which he talks about his addiction to crack cocaine. Prosecutors also plan to present Biden's own text messages in which he talks about his drug use.\n\nLess than a year ago, it appeared as though Hunter Biden would avoid trial entirely.\n\nHe had a tentative deal with prosecutors under which he would plead guilty to tax charges and enter into a diversion agreement on the gun offenses that would have allowed him to avoid trial.\n\nBut that deal fell apart at a hearing in front of U.S. district Judge Maryellen Noreika, who expressed concerns about how the deal was structured. Biden's legal team and prosecutors were unable to patch it back together.\n\nWeeks later, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Weiss special counsel, and he later brought the two prosecutions against Biden.\n\nHunter Biden's attorney, Abbe Lowell, has tried to get the case dismissed on various grounds, but the judge has denied them all.\n\nHe has said that the gun charges his client faces are rarely, if ever, brought under similar circumstances. He also accuses Weiss of bowing to Republican pressure in bringing both cases against Hunter Biden.", "source": {"uri": "kgou.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KGOU 106.3"}, "authors": [],

Hunter Biden's trial on federal gun charges is scheduled to start on Monday, June 3, the first criminal trial of the child of a sitting U.S. President. He's charged with three felony firearm offenses stemming from a gun purchase in 2018, during a period he has said he was struggling with drug addiction.\n\nHe's pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe trial is expected to last for up to two weeks and comes at a moment when his father President Joe Biden is locked in a close race for the presidency with Donald Trump, who has himself just been found guilty of 34 felony counts in a Manhattan fraud case.\n\nHere's what to know about the Hunter Biden trial.\n\nThe Justice Department has charged Hunter Biden with unlawfully purchasing a revolver while using illicit drugs and lying on both a federal form and to a firearms dealer about his drug use when he purchased the weapon in October 2018. He has publicly admitted that he was struggling with a crack cocaine addiction during that period.\n\n\"All my energy revolved around smoking drugs and making arrangements to buy drugs -- feeding the beast,\" he wrote in his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things.\"\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and his lawyers have filed several motions to dismiss the case. During the trial, federal prosecutors are planning to present photos, testimony, and messages to show that Hunter Biden was using illegal drugs at the time he purchased a Colt Cobra 38SPL and failed to disclose that on the gun purchase form, as is required by federal law.\n\nTo secure a conviction, prosecutors will need to prove to jurors that Hunter Biden knowingly made a false statement on the federal form, that the statement was meant to deceive the salesman on a fact material to the sale, and that he knew he was an unlawful user of or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have suggested they may argue in court that he had recently finished rehab and may not have considered himself a drug user at the time he purchased the revolver. \"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" Abbe Lowell, the primary defense attorney for Hunter Biden, wrote in court documents filed in May. \"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nThe gun charges were brought after a years-long investigation by Department of Justice Special Counsel David Weiss, the U.S. Attorney for Delaware who was appointed by former President Donald Trump. Weiss initially began investigating Hunter Biden's tax affairs in December 2020, weeks after Joe Biden won the 2020 election. According to The Washington Post, federal agents had given the U.S. Attorney in Delaware information that Hunter Biden reportedly answered \"no\" to a question on a gun purchase form in 2018 asking if he was using illicit drugs.\n\nIf convicted on all three counts, Hunter Biden faces a maximum punishment of 25 years in prison and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. However, it's rare for defendants to get a maximum sentence when they are first-time offenders like the President's son.\n\nBy law, lying on a Firearms Transaction Record is a felony and a conviction on that charge could carry a prison sentence of up to 10 years for each count. Unlawfully purchasing a revolver while using illicit drugs carries a maximum prison sentence of up to five years. But legal experts say it's atypical for prosecutors to bring charges on the infraction. Some defendants in past similar cases didn't face jail time at all.\n\nUltimately, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika in Delaware will decide sentencing if Hunter Biden is convicted by the jury, which consists of 12 residents of New Castle County.\n\nHunter Biden had previously reached an agreement with the Justice Department to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges in a separate case and avoid prosecution on the gun charge if he was willing to submit to probation, enter a diversion program, remain drug-free for 24 months, and agree to never own a firearm again. But that deal fell apart in court in July 2023 after Judge Noreika balked at signing off on the plea deal.\n\nCongressional Republicans at the time had blasted the Justice Department for its efforts to pursue the plea deal with Hunter Biden, with Rep. James Comer, Republican of Kentucky and the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, calling it a \"slap on the wrist\" that revealed a \"two-tiered system of justice.\"\n\nMessages stored on Hunter Biden's laptop after he bought the revolver could come up at trial. Emails and photos from his laptop were spread online after he allegedly dropped it off at a Delaware repair shop and the hard drive was allegedly acquired by Trump loyalist Rudy Giuliani.\n\nHunter Biden's legal team intend to raise questions about the authenticity of the files from the laptop in the trial, but prosecutors have said there's no evidence the data was compromised. In one of the text messages that prosecutors plan to use as evidence, according to court filings, Hunter Biden allegedly wrote that he was waiting for his \"dealer named Mookie\" the day after he purchased the gun. The following day Hunter Biden allegedly wrote, \"I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney.\"\n\nIn addition to the three counts in Delaware, Hunter Biden is also facing federal tax charges in Los Angeles for allegedly failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes in income from foreign businesses during the years he's acknowledged being addicted to drugs. He was charged in December by a federal grand jury in California with evasion of a tax assessment, failure to file and pay taxes, and filing a false or fraudulent tax return. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThat case is set to go to trial in September, during the home stretch of the campaign season for his father.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

(AP) -- A federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter opened Monday with jury selection, following the collapse of a plea deal that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden was seated in the front row of the courtroom, in a show of support for her son.\n\nIn a statement, the president said he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants by saying he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nIn Delaware, prospective jurors who answered \"yes\" on a questionnaire were quizzed individually by Judge Maryellen Noreika to determine whether they could be fair and impartial. One by one, they were dismissed, winnowing down the pool.\n\nThe questions ranged from their knowledge of the case to their thoughts about gun ownership and whether they or anyone close to them have struggled with substance abuse or addiction or ever owned a gun. Other questions focused on the role politics may have played in the charges.\n\nOne prospective juror said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she replied when an attorney asked her opinion. Another prospective juror was dismissed because his family has a long history in law enforcement, and he said he could not be impartial. A third was excused because he was very aware of the case, and, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nOnly one potential juror answered \"no\" to all the questions and moved on to the next phase. Another who was not dismissed said he holds a concealed carry permit and owns three handguns. The man said he has strong views on gun ownership and believes every law-abiding citizen should be able to own a gun.\n\n\"I believe the Second Amendment is very important,\" he explained.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first to the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court, and his wife Melissa. The president in Wilmington until he left for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They will also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nIf convicted, he faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedin", "source": {"uri": "wccbcharlotte.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WCCB Charlotte's CW"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He has pleaded not guilty. It is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California.\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden, Hunter Biden's wife Melissa Cohen Biden and his half-sister Ashley Biden were in attendance at the trial in Wilmington, before U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika.\n\n\"Jill and I love our son and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" Joe Biden said in a statement, adding that a lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction.\n\nTrump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York on Thursday of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House. Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.\n\nIn the case brought by U.S. Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, last September Hunter Biden was charged with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018. Weiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday. The president, who had been expected to depart Rehoboth Beach on Monday, traveled on Sunday evening to his home in Wilmington.\n\nPOTENTIAL JURORS\n\nNoreika began screening potential jurors for their ability to commit to serving the length of the trial, which is expected to run through the end of next week.\n\n\"Do you think you can put aside your views on gun ownership,\" she asked a potential juror, who responded that she could be impartial.\n\nOther potential jurors were asked about addiction, convictions and run-ins with law enforcement.\n\nAll 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nThe case is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nProsecution lawyers revealed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter Biden's phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers. They said they may call as a witness his former wife Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they may try to show he had completed a drug rehabilitation program before purchasing the gun and may have considered his answer on the gun purchase form to be truthful.\n\nA plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Biden. Hunter Biden's lawyers blamed Republican pressure for the failure of the plea agreement.\n\nNoreika entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.\n\nThat testimony could have helped Biden show that he did not know he was lying on the background check form.

Reuters-Yonhap\n\nJury selection is to begin Monday in a federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election.\n\nHunter Biden , who spent the weekend with his father, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes . Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden , who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother , Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.

REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz\n\nWILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) -The criminal trial of Hunter Biden kicked off on Monday in federal court in Delaware as President Joe Biden's son faces gun charges in a historic case that begins four days after Donald Trump became the first former U.S. president to be convicted.\n\nHunter Biden, 54, arrived at the courthouse for the first trial of the child of a sitting president, in which he will face three felony charges stemming from his purchase and possession of a revolver in 2018. He has pleaded not guilty. It is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California.\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden, Hunter Biden's wife Melissa Cohen Biden and his half-sister Ashley Biden were in attendance at the trial in Wilmington, before U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika.\n\n\"Jill and I love our son and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" Joe Biden said in a statement, adding that a lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction.\n\nTrump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York on Thursday of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House. Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.\n\nIn the case brought by U.S. Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, last September Hunter Biden was charged with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018. Weiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday. The president, who had been expected to depart Rehoboth Beach on Monday, traveled on Sunday evening to his home in Wilmington.\n\nPOTENTIAL JURORS\n\nNoreika began screening potential jurors for their ability to commit to serving the length of the trial, which is expected to run through the end of next week.\n\n\"Do you think you can put aside your views on gun ownership,\" she asked a potential juror, who responded that she could be impartial.\n\nOther potential jurors were asked about addiction, convictions and run-ins with law enforcement.\n\nAll 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nThe case is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nProsecution lawyers revealed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter Biden's phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers. They said they may call as a witness his former wife Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they may try to show he had completed a drug rehabilitation program before purchasing the gun and may have considered his answer on the gun purchase form to be truthful.\n\nA plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Biden. Hunter Biden's lawyers blamed Republican pressure for the failure of the plea agreement.\n\nNoreika entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.\n\nThat testimony could have helped Biden show that he did not know he was lying on the background check form. The government is required to prove that Biden knowingly lied.\n\nCongressional Republicans spent years in vain trying to find evidence of a corrupt link between Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, including work for Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and his father's political power.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; additional reporting by Stephanie Kelly in Rehoboth

(AP) -- A federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter opened Monday with jury selection, following the collapse of a plea deal that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden was seated in the front row of the courtroom, in a show of support for her son.\n\nIn a statement, the president said he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants by saying he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nIn Delaware, prospective jurors who answered \"yes\" on a questionnaire were quizzed individually by Judge Maryellen Noreika to determine whether they could be fair and impartial. One by one, they were dismissed, winnowing down the pool.\n\nThe questions ranged from their knowledge of the case to their thoughts about gun ownership and whether they or anyone close to them have struggled with substance abuse or addiction or ever owned a gun. Other questions focused on the role politics may have played in the charges.\n\nOne prospective juror said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she replied when an attorney asked her opinion. Another prospective juror was dismissed because his family has a long history in law enforcement, and he said he could not be impartial. A third was excused because he was very aware of the case, and, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nOnly one potential juror answered \"no\" to all the questions and moved on to the next phase. Another who was not dismissed said he holds a concealed carry permit and owns three handguns. The man said he has strong views on gun ownership and believes every law-abiding citizen should be able to own a gun.\n\n\"I believe the Second Amendment is very important,\" he explained.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first to the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court, and his wife Melissa. The president in Wilmington until he left for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They will also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nIf convicted, he faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

(AP) -- President Joe Biden's son Hunter arrived at court today for jury selection in a federal gun case against him after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election.

She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack.

They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in the US state of Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction.\n\nHe has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nBiden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he is being unfairly targeted by the US justice department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic President's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City.\n\nA jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underlines how the criminal courtroom has taken centre stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay 1.4 million dollars in taxes.\n\nBoth cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a years-long investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Mr Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanour offences to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart.\n\nUS attorney general Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial is not about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs - which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe President's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who has long been concerned about the wellbeing and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinised.\n\nHe is also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his father and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the US President was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first at the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by US secret service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court to support him.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anaemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they are planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved.\n\nThe contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which Hunter Biden often nude and doing drugs, and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office.\n\nShe will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nThe judge is also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the President. Also, she will ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including the question: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"", "source": {"uri":

The case, brought by US Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California.\n\nThe judge in the gun case, Maryellen Noreika, began screening potential jurors on Monday, many of whom disclosed they had family members or acquaintances with drug problems, including one juror who became emotional when discussing a brother-in-law with an addiction.\n\nFew jurors expressed strong political views.\n\nOne said he had worked with First Lady Jill Biden and said he had met \"Jill's husband\" multiple times. He also said he supported the campaign of Ferris Wharton, who ran unsuccessfully for Delaware attorney general against Beau Biden, Hunter's brother, who died of cancer in 2015.\n\nAll 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nJill Biden, Hunter Biden's wife Melissa Cohen Biden and his half-sister Ashley Biden were in attendance at the trial in Wilmington, before US District Judge Maryellen Noreika.\n\n\"Jill and I love our son and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" Joe Biden said in a statement, adding that a lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction.\n\nThe trial comes days after Trump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 US election that put him in the White House. Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the 5 November US election.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced on 11 July. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the US Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday. The president, who had been expected to depart Rehoboth Beach on Monday, traveled on Sunday evening to his home in Wilmington.\n\nThe case is expected to centre on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nProsecution lawyers revealed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter Biden's phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers. They said they may call as a witness his former wife Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they may try to show he had completed a drug rehabilitation program before purchasing the gun and may have considered his answer on the gun purchase form to be truthful.\n\nA plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Biden. Hunter Biden's lawyers blamed Republican pressure for the failure of the plea agreement.\n\nNoreika entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.\n\nThat testimony could have helped Biden show that he did not know he was lying on the background check form. The government is required to prove that Biden knowingly lied.\n\nCongressional Republicans spent years in vain trying to find evidence of a corrupt link between Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, including work for Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and his father's political power.", "source": {"uri": "news24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news24"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Biden attorneys are expected in court Friday, May 24, days before the president's son is expected to stand trial on federal firearms charges in Delaware as his father's reelection campaign unfolds. Biden is charged with lying about his drug use in October 2018 on a form to buy a gun that he kept for about 11 days in Delaware.\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Jury selection is to begin Monday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son after a deal with prosecutors fell apart that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election.\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his father, has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment.\n\nThe trial comes just four days after Donald Trump was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City after a jury found him guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are not related, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a years-long investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned some unusual aspects of the deal that included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a \"diversion agreement\" on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective; Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad, and attending church together.\n\nBiden, in a last minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding the helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show he was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun - and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence Hunter Biden's published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos where he's often nude and doing drugs and highly personal messages where he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period where, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother Beau Biden from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018, and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBOC TV-16"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wboc.com", "name":

The culmination of a sprawling investigation, the deal between Hunter Biden and prosecutors was going to spare him a politically explosive trial in the middle of his father's reelection campaign and likely prison time.\n\nBut it all fell apart.\n\nNow, Hunter Biden is headed to trial on federal gun charges in a case brought by his father's Justice Department at a time when America's political and legal worlds are colliding like never before. Dogged for years by investigations, scrutinized over his troubled personal life and vilified by Republicans, the younger Biden is now also confronting the threat of felony convictions and time behind bars.\n\nU.S. News\n\nJudge rejects Hunter Biden's bid to delay his June trial on federal gun charges AP via Scripps News 3:51 PM, May 14, 2024\n\nThe case opening Monday with jury selection in Delaware is not about Hunter Biden's business dealings, which have been the focus of the yearslong federal investigation and Republicans' fruitless impeachment inquiry into the Democratic president. It's about a gun Hunter Biden had for about 11 days -- a .38-caliber Colt Cobra Special. Prosecutors say he bought it illegally in October 2018 because he falsely swore on a federal form that he was not a drug user. He never fired the gun, according to his lawyers, and it ended up dumped in a trash can.\n\nThe trial will lack details about his foreign business matters that Republicans have seized on to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt, but it is expected to feature deeply personal and embarrassing testimony about dark time in the younger Biden's life. And it probably will provide new political impetus for Donald Trump's allies, who are eager to distract from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's own legal problems after he was convicted of 34 felony counts in his hush money trial.\n\nAllies of Joe Biden are worried about the toll the trial may take on the president, who already is concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as that son's darkest moments are relived in public. They also are worried that the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign while facing anemic poll numbers and is scheduled to prepare in Wilmington for a June 27 debate with Trump as the trial plays out nearby.\n\nIt once looked like Hunter Biden was going to avoid prosecution in the gun case altogether.\n\nThe deal was announced last June. Nearly three years earlier, Hunter Biden had confirmed the federal investigation into his tax affairs in December 2020, shortly after his father was elected.\n\nPolitical Scandals\n\nHunter Biden seeks a delay in his federal tax trial set to begin next month AP via Scripps News 11:01 AM, May 22, 2024\n\nThe younger Biden would have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses; prosecutors would have recommended two years of probation. There was also a \"diversion agreement\" that would have allowed him to escape prosecution on a felony gun charge as long he stayed out of trouble for two years.\n\nBut the plea hearing quickly unraveled.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, quizzed both sides with concerns about the deal. To her, it seemed unusual and required her to be involved in the case in a way most federal judges are not. The lawyers huddled, trying to salvage the deal. At one point they could be heard yelling at each other.\n\n\"Well, we'll just rip it up!\" Chris Clark, Biden's then-attorney, shouted as tempers flared.\n\n\"So what do we do now?\" the judge later asked the lawyers.\n\n\"Then there is no deal,\" prosecutor Leo Wise told her.\n\nA few weeks later, Attorney General Merrick Garland named David Weiss, the Trump-nominated U.S. attorney in Delaware who was leading the investigation, as a special counsel.\n\nHunter Biden was indicted a month after that on three gun counts. They are punishable by up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.\n\nThe bitterness between prosecutors and Hunter Biden's legal team is glaring. It's likely to be on display Monday.\n\nClark withdrew from the case, saying he might be called to testify in a potential legal dispute over the now-defunct deal. Another defense lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has accused Weiss of caving to political pressure to indict the president's son after Trump and other Republicans blasted the \"sweetheart deal.\" The defense has noted that charges related to gun possession by drug users are rare when not in connection with a more serious crime.\n\n\"Mr. Biden is not being prosecuted for any sin that DOJ (the Department of Justice) believes he has committed. He is being punished for the perceived sins of his father -- the sin of opposing Mr. Trump's election to the president,\" according to court papers filed by Lowell, who also has represented Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the former president's daughter and son-in-law.\n\nProsecutors say Lowell's contention is \"fiction designed for a Hollywood script.\"\n\n\"Contrary to his assertion, he has not established that the Special Counsel, appointed by and serving at the pleasure of President Biden and his Attorney General, is punishing the defendant 'for the perceived sins of his father' in order to capitulate to a former President because of his tweets,\" Weiss' team responded.\n\nWeiss has said \"political considerations\" played no part in the investigation. He told lawmakers behind closed doors last year that that no one at the Justice Department prevented him from pursuing charges or taking other necessary steps, disputing claims from two IRS whistleblowers that the department improperly interfered in the tax investigation.\n\nThe case stems from a period where, by his own admission, Hunter Biden was addicted to crack.\n\nIn his memoir \"Beautiful Things,\" he described becoming consumed by drugs and alcohol after his older brother, Beau, died in 2015 at age 46 from brain cancer. The brothers were very close, having survived a car crash when they were young that killed their mother and baby sister.\n\nPath to the White House\n\nComparing the records of Biden and Trump on higher education Jennifer Glenfield 8:04 AM, May 30, 2024\n\nHunter Biden has said he has been sober since 2019. But prosecutors intend to use his memoir to make the case that he knew he was addicted to drugs when he denied it on the form that every person must fill out when buying a gun. They plan to show jurors text messages, videos and photos of Hunter Biden smoking crack, as well details about cocaine residue that authorities say was found on the pouch he used to hold his gun.\n\n\"I'm a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I've ruined every relationship I've ever cherished,\" Hunter Biden wrote in one text message weeks after he bought the firearm, according to prosecutors.\n\nJurors are expected to hear testimony from his ex-wife and other former romantic partners, including Beau's widow, Hallie Biden, with whom Hunter Biden had a relationship after his brother's death. Hallie Biden found the gun in Hunter Biden's truck and threw it in a trash. It was found by a man collecting recyclables who gave it to the police.\n\nThe defense has suggested it will attack the credibility of the gun shop employees, noting there were changes to the gun-purchase form after the sale. Prosecutors say there were minor additions unrelated to the parts Hunter Biden filled out. His lawyers have suggested they may argue that Hunter Biden did not see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form.\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" the defense wrote in a recent filing. \"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nThe case is expected to last a couple of weeks. He also is scheduled to stand trial in September in California in the case where he is accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over four years.", "source": {"uri": "newschannel5.com",

He has pleaded not guilty. It is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California.\n\nThe trial in Wilmington, with US District Judge Maryellen Noreika presiding, begins with the jury selection process.\n\nTrump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York on Thursday of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 US election that put him in the White House. Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the November 5 US election.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.\n\nIn the case brought by US Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, last September Hunter Biden was charged with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018. Weiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the US Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday. The president, who had been expected to depart Rehoboth Beach on Monday, traveled on Sunday evening to his home in Wilmington.\n\nPotential jurors will be screened for their ability to commit to serving the length of the trial, which is expected to run through the end of next week. All 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nThe case is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nProsecution lawyers revealed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter Biden's phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers. They said they may call as a witness his former wife Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they may try to show he had completed a drug rehabilitation program before purchasing the gun and may have considered his answer on the gun purchase form to be truthful.\n\nA plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Biden. Hunter Biden's lawyers blamed Republican pressure for the failure of the plea agreement.\n\nNoreika entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.\n\nThat testimony could have helped Biden show that he did not know he was lying on the background check form. The government is required to prove that Biden knowingly lied.\n\nCongressional Republicans spent years in vain trying to find evidence of a corrupt link between Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, including work for Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and his father's political power.", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cyprus Mail"}, "authors": [],

(AP) -- A federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter opened Monday with jury selection, following the collapse of a plea deal that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden was seated in the front row of the courtroom, in a show of support for her son.\n\nIn a statement, the president said he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants by saying he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nIn Delaware, prospective jurors who answered \"yes\" on a questionnaire were quizzed individually by Judge Maryellen Noreika to determine whether they could be fair and impartial. One by one, they were dismissed, winnowing down the pool.\n\nThe questions ranged from their knowledge of the case to their thoughts about gun ownership and whether they or anyone close to them have struggled with substance abuse or addiction or ever owned a gun. Other questions focused on the role politics may have played in the charges.\n\nOne prospective juror said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she replied when an attorney asked her opinion. Another prospective juror was dismissed because his family has a long history in law enforcement, and he said he could not be impartial. A third was excused because he was very aware of the case, and, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nOnly one potential juror answered \"no\" to all the questions and moved on to the next phase. Another who was not dismissed said he holds a concealed carry permit and owns three handguns. The man said he has strong views on gun ownership and believes every law-abiding citizen should be able to own a gun.\n\n\"I believe the Second Amendment is very important,\" he explained.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first to the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court, and his wife Melissa. The president in Wilmington until he left for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They will also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nIf convicted, he faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

(AP) -- President Joe Biden's son Hunter arrived at court on Monday for jury selection in a federal gun case against him after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden arrived shortly after, entering the courthouse in support of her son.\n\nJoe Biden said that as president he wouldn't comment on the criminal trial but as a dad he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said in a statement. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first at the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court to support him.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\n___\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nLong reported from Washington.

He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants by saying he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City.\n\nProspective jurors who answered \"yes\" on a questionnaire were quizzed individually by Judge Maryellen Noreika to determine whether they could be fair and impartial. One by one, they were dismissed, winnowing down the pool.\n\nThe questions ranged from their knowledge of the case to their thoughts about gun ownership and whether they or anyone close to them have struggled with substance abuse or addiction or ever owned a gun.\n\nOne prospective juror said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she replied when an attorney asked her opinion. Another prospective juror was dismissed because his family has a long history in law enforcement, and he said he could not be impartial. A third was excused because he was very aware of the case, and, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nOnly one potential juror answered \"no\" to all the questions and moved on to the next phase. Another who was not dismissed said he holds a concealed carry permit and owns three handguns. The man said he has strong views on gun ownership and believes every law-abiding citizen should be able to own a gun.\n\n\"I believe the Second Amendment is very important,\" he explained.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first to the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court to support him. The president was at their Wilmington home until he left for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They will also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_hals@newsmax.com", "name": "Tom

(AP) -- Jury selection is to begin Monday in a federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election.\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his father, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.

They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer.

"body": "The criminal trial of Hunter Biden has kicked off in federal court in Delaware as US President Joe Biden's son faces gun charges in a historic case.\n\nHunter Biden, 54, arrived at the courthouse for the first trial of the child of a sitting US president, in which he will face three felony charges stemming from his purchase and possession of a revolver in 2018.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIt is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California.\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden, Hunter Biden's wife Melissa Cohen Biden and his half-sister Ashley Biden were in attendance at the trial in Wilmington, before US District Judge Maryellen Noreika.\n\n\"Jill and I love our son and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" Joe Biden said in a statement, adding that a lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction.\n\nIn the case brought by US Special Counsel David Weiss, an appointee of former president Donald Trump, last September Hunter Biden was charged with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018.\n\nWeiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison although defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the US Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday.\n\nThe president, who had been expected to depart Rehoboth Beach on Monday, travelled on Sunday evening to his home in Wilmington.\n\nNoreika began screening potential jurors for their ability to commit to serving the length of the trial, which is expected to run through the end of next week.\n\n\"Do you think you can put aside your views on gun ownership,\" she asked a potential juror, who responded that she could be impartial.\n\nOther potential jurors were asked about addiction, convictions and run-ins with law enforcement.\n\nAll 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nThe case is expected to centre on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography Beautiful Things.\n\nHe told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nProsecution lawyers revealed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter Biden's phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers.\n\nThey said they may call as a witness his former wife Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they may try to show he had completed a drug rehabilitation program before purchasing the gun and may have considered his answer on the gun purchase form to be truthful.\n\nA plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Biden.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers blamed Republican pressure for the failure of the plea agreement.\n\nNoreika entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.\n\nThat testimony could have helped Biden show that he did not know he was lying on the background check form.\n\nThe government is required to prove that Biden knowingly lied.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au",

(AP) -- A federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter opened Monday with jury selection, following the collapse of a plea deal that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden was seated in the front row of the courtroom, in a show of support for her son.\n\nIn a statement, the president said he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants by saying he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nIn Delaware, prospective jurors who answered \"yes\" on a questionnaire were quizzed individually by Judge Maryellen Noreika to determine whether they could be fair and impartial. One by one, they were dismissed, winnowing down the pool.\n\nThe questions ranged from their knowledge of the case to their thoughts about gun ownership and whether they or anyone close to them have struggled with substance abuse or addiction or ever owned a gun. Other questions focused on the role politics may have played in the charges.\n\nOne prospective juror said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she replied when an attorney asked her opinion. Another prospective juror was dismissed because his family has a long history in law enforcement, and he said he could not be impartial. A third was excused because he was very aware of the case, and, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nOnly one potential juror answered \"no\" to all the questions and moved on to the next phase. Another who was not dismissed said he holds a concealed carry permit and owns three handguns. The man said he has strong views on gun ownership and believes every law-abiding citizen should be able to own a gun.\n\n\"I believe the Second Amendment is very important,\" he explained.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first to the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court, and his wife Melissa. The president in Wilmington until he left for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They will also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nIf convicted, he faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- A federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter opened Monday with jury selection, following the collapse of a plea deal that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden was seated in the front row of the courtroom, in a show of support for her son.\n\nIn a statement, the president said he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants by saying he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nIn Delaware, prospective jurors who answered \"yes\" on a questionnaire were quizzed individually by Judge Maryellen Noreika to determine whether they could be fair and impartial. One by one, they were dismissed, winnowing down the pool.\n\nThe questions ranged from their knowledge of the case to their thoughts about gun ownership and whether they or anyone close to them have struggled with substance abuse or addiction or ever owned a gun. Other questions focused on the role politics may have played in the charges.\n\nOne prospective juror said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she replied when an attorney asked her opinion. Another prospective juror was dismissed because his family has a long history in law enforcement, and he said he could not be impartial. A third was excused because he was very aware of the case, and, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nOnly one potential juror answered \"no\" to all the questions and moved on to the next phase. Another who was not dismissed said he holds a concealed carry permit and owns three handguns. The man said he has strong views on gun ownership and believes every law-abiding citizen should be able to own a gun.\n\n\"I believe the Second Amendment is very important,\" he explained.\n\nAttorneys jointly moved to dismiss a woman who expressed strong anti-gun views during questioning.\n\n\"I would like stronger laws in this country about certain types of weapons,\" she said. \"The ones with high repeat, you know, that kill children in schools.\"\n\nThe woman also said the government should require more background checks and make it harder to get a gun \"that can kill a lot of people at once.\"\n\n\"I would ban them altogether to be honest,\" acknowledged the woman, who also said she has donated to Democratic congressional candidates around the country and joined \"one of the resistance groups\" after the 2016 election.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first to the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court, and his wife, Melissa. The president was in Wilmington until he left for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nDefense attorneys have suggested they may argue that Hunter Biden didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They will also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.", "source": {"uri": "wpri.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WPRI.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nBy Tom Hals\n\nWILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) -The criminal trial of Hunter Biden kicks off on Monday in federal court in Delaware as President Joe Biden's son faces gun charges in a historic case that begins four days after Donald Trump became the first former U.S. president to be convicted.\n\nHunter Biden, 54, arrived at the courthouse for the first trial of the child of a sitting president, in which he will face three felony charges stemming from his purchase and possession of a revolver in 2018. He has pleaded not guilty. It is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California.\n\nThe trial in Wilmington, with U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika presiding, begins with the jury selection process.\n\nTrump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York on Thursday of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House. Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.\n\nIn the case brought by U.S. Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, last September Hunter Biden was charged with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018. Weiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday. The president, who had been expected to depart Rehoboth Beach on Monday, traveled on Sunday evening to his home in Wilmington.\n\nPotential jurors will be screened for their ability to commit to serving the length of the trial, which is expected to run through the end of next week. All 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nThe case is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nProsecution lawyers revealed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter Biden's phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers. They said they may call as a witness his former wife Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they may try to show he had completed a drug rehabilitation program before purchasing the gun and may have considered his answer on the gun purchase form to be truthful.\n\nA plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Biden. Hunter Biden's lawyers blamed Republican pressure for the failure of the plea agreement.\n\nNoreika entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.\n\nThat testimony could have helped Biden show that he did not know he was lying on the background check form. The government is required to prove that Biden knowingly lied.\n\nCongressional Republicans spent years in vain trying to find evidence of a corrupt link between Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, including work for Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and his father's political power.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; additional reporting by Stephanie Kelly in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware; editing by Amy Stevens, Will Dunham, Michael Perry and Chizu Nomiyama)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

(AP) - A federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter opened Monday with jury selection, following the collapse of a plea deal that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden was seated in the front row of the courtroom, in a show of support for her son. In a statement, the president said he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\u009d \"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\u009d Hunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants by saying he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days. He has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son. The trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign. In Delaware, prospective jurors who answered \"yes\"\u009d on a questionnaire were quizzed individually by Judge Maryellen Noreika to determine whether they could be fair and impartial. One by one, they were dismissed, winnowing down the pool. The questions ranged from their knowledge of the case to their thoughts about gun ownership and whether they or anyone close to them have struggled with substance abuse or addiction or ever owned a gun. Other questions focused on the role politics may have played in the charges. One prospective juror said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports. \"It's not a good one,\"\u009d she replied when an attorney asked her opinion. Another prospective juror was dismissed because his family has a long history in law enforcement, and he said he could not be impartial. A third was excused because he was very aware of the case, and, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\u009d Only one potential juror answered \"no\"\u009d to all the questions and moved on to the next phase. Another who was not dismissed said he holds a concealed carry permit and owns three handguns. The man said he has strong views on gun ownership and believes every law-abiding citizen should be able to own a gun. \"I believe the Second Amendment is very important,\"\u009d he explained. Attorneys jointly moved to dismiss a woman who expressed strong anti-gun views during questioning. \"I would like stronger laws in this country about certain types of weapons,\"\u009d she said. \"The ones with high repeat, you know, that kill children in schools.\"\u009d The woman also said the government should require more background checks and make it harder to get a gun \"that can kill a lot of people at once.\"\u009d \"I would ban them altogether to be honest,\"\u009d acknowledged the woman, who also said she has donated to Democratic congressional candidates around the country and joined \"one of the resistance groups\"\u009d after the 2016 election. Hunter Biden also faces a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings. But Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted. This trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs - which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display. The president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. Allies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out. Hunter Biden arrived first to the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court, and his wife Melissa. The president in Wilmington until he left for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut. The case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs. Defense attorneys have suggested they may argue that Hunter Biden didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\"\u009d to the question on the form. They will also attack the credibility of the gun store owner. If convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars. ___ Long reported from Washington.

He has pleaded not guilty. It is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California.\n\nThe trial in Wilmington, with U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika presiding, begins with the jury selection process.\n\nTrump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York on Thursday of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House. Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.\n\nDavid Shribman: After Trump, focus shifts to Hunter Biden's trial\n\nHunter Biden was charged last September in the case brought by U.S. Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-calibre revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018. Weiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday in the sunny beach town. The president, who had been expected to depart Rehoboth Beach on Monday, travelled on Sunday evening to his home in Wilmington.\n\nPotential jurors will be screened for their ability to commit to serving the length of the trial, which is expected to run through the end of next week. All 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nThe case is expected to centre on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nProsecution lawyers revealed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter Biden's phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers. They said they may call as a witness his former wife Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they may try to show he had completed a drug rehabilitation program before purchasing the gun and may have considered his answer on the gun purchase form to be truthful.\n\nA plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Biden. Hunter Biden's lawyers blamed Republican pressure for the failure of the plea agreement.\n\nCongressional Republicans spent years in vain trying to find evidence of a corrupt link between Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, including work for Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and his father's political power.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

He has pleaded not guilty. It is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California.\n\nThe trial in Wilmington, with US District Judge Maryellen Noreika presiding, begins with the jury selection process.\n\nTrump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York on Thursday of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 US election that put him in the White House. Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the November 5 US election.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.\n\nHunter Biden was charged last September in the case brought by US Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018. Weiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the US Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday in the sunny beach town. The president, who had been expected to depart Rehoboth Beach today, travelled on Sunday evening to his home in Wilmington.\n\nPotential jurors will be screened for their ability to commit to serving the length of the trial, which is expected to run through the end of next week. All 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nThe case is expected to centre on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nProsecution lawyers revealed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter Biden's phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers. They said they may call as a witness his former wife Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they may try to show he had completed a drug rehabilitation programme before purchasing the gun and may have considered his answer on the gun purchase form to be truthful.\n\nA plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Biden. Hunter Biden's lawyers blamed Republican pressure for the failure of the plea agreement.\n\nCongressional Republicans spent years in vain trying to find evidence of a corrupt link between Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, including work for Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and his father's political power. -- Reuters", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

(AP) -- A federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter opened Monday with jury selection, following the collapse of a plea deal that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden was seated in the front row of the courtroom, in a show of support for her son.\n\nIn a statement, the president said he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants by saying he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nIn Delaware, prospective jurors who answered \"yes\" on a questionnaire were quizzed individually by Judge Maryellen Noreika to determine whether they could be fair and impartial. One by one, they were dismissed, winnowing down the pool.\n\nThe questions ranged from their knowledge of the case to their thoughts about gun ownership and whether they or anyone close to them have struggled with substance abuse or addiction or ever owned a gun. Other questions focused on the role politics may have played in the charges.\n\nOne prospective juror said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she replied when an attorney asked her opinion. Another prospective juror was dismissed because his family has a long history in law enforcement, and he said he could not be impartial. A third was excused because he was very aware of the case, and, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nOnly one potential juror answered \"no\" to all the questions and moved on to the next phase. Another who was not dismissed said he holds a concealed carry permit and owns three handguns. The man said he has strong views on gun ownership and believes every law-abiding citizen should be able to own a gun.\n\n\"I believe the Second Amendment is very important,\" he explained.\n\nAttorneys jointly moved to dismiss a woman who expressed strong anti-gun views during questioning.\n\n\"I would like stronger laws in this country about certain types of weapons,\" she said. \"The ones with high repeat, you know, that kill children in schools.\"\n\nThe woman also said the government should require more background checks and make it harder to get a gun \"that can kill a lot of people at once.\"\n\n\"I would ban them altogether to be honest,\" acknowledged the woman, who also said she has donated to Democratic congressional candidates around the country and joined \"one of the resistance groups\" after the 2016 election.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first to the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court, and his wife Melissa. The president in Wilmington until he left for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nDefense attorneys have suggested they may argue that Hunter Biden didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They will also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe President's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who has long been concerned about the wellbeing and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinised.\n\nHe is also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his father and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the US President was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first at the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by US secret service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court to support him.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anaemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they are planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved.\n\nThe contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which Hunter Biden often nude and doing drugs, and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office.\n\nShe will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nThe judge is also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the President. Also, she will ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including the question: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"", "source": {"uri":

He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment.\n\nThe trial comes just four days after Donald Trump was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City after a jury found him guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are not related, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a years-long investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned some unusual aspects of the deal that included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a \"diversion agreement\" on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective; Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad, and attending church together.\n\nBiden, in a last minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding the helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show he was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun -- and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence Hunter Biden's published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos where he's often nude and doing drugs and highly personal messages where he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period where, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother Beau Biden from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018, and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He has pleaded not guilty. It is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California.\n\nThe trial in Wilmington, with U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika presiding, begins with the jury selection process.\n\nTrump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York on Thursday of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House. Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.\n\nIn the case brought by U.S. Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, last September Hunter Biden was charged with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018. Weiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday. The president, who had been expected to depart Rehoboth Beach on Monday, traveled on Sunday evening to his home in Wilmington.\n\nPotential jurors will be screened for their ability to commit to serving the length of the trial, which is expected to run through the end of next week. All 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nThe case is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nProsecution lawyers revealed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter Biden's phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers. They said they may call as a witness his former wife Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they may try to show he had completed a drug rehabilitation program before purchasing the gun and may have considered his answer on the gun purchase form to be truthful.\n\nA plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Biden. Hunter Biden's lawyers blamed Republican pressure for the failure of the plea agreement.\n\nNoreika entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.\n\nThat testimony could have helped Biden show that he did not know he was lying on the background check form. The government is required to prove that Biden knowingly lied.\n\nCongressional Republicans spent years in vain trying to find evidence of a corrupt link between Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, including work for Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and his father's political power.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; additional reporting by Stephanie Kelly in Rehoboth

He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment.\n\nThe trial comes just four days after Donald Trump was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City after a jury found him guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are not related, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a years-long investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned some unusual aspects of the deal that included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a \"diversion agreement\" on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nHunter Biden arrives for a court appearance, Friday, May 24, 2024, in Wilmington, Del. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs - which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president\u00b4s allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who\u00b4s long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective; Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad, and attending church together.\n\nBiden, in a last minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding the helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show he was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun - and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence Hunter Biden\u00b4s published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos where he's often nude and doing drugs and highly personal messages where he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she\u00b4ll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period where, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother Beau Biden from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018, and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn\u00b4t see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden\u00b4s ex-wife and his brother\u00b4s widow Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.\n\nHunter Biden, President Joe Biden's son, right, walks with his wife Melissa Cohen Biden, to board Air Force One at Dover Air Force Base, Del., Friday, May 31, 2024.

(AP) -- A federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter opened Monday with jury selection, following the collapse of a plea deal that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden was seated in the front row of the courtroom, in a show of support for her son.\n\nIn a statement, the president said he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants by saying he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nIn Delaware, prospective jurors who answered \"yes\" on a questionnaire were quizzed individually by Judge Maryellen Noreika to determine whether they could be fair and impartial. One by one, they were dismissed, winnowing down the pool.\n\nThe questions ranged from their knowledge of the case to their thoughts about gun ownership and whether they or anyone close to them have struggled with substance abuse or addiction or ever owned a gun. Other questions focused on the role politics may have played in the charges.\n\nOne prospective juror said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she replied when an attorney asked her opinion. Another prospective juror was dismissed because his family has a long history in law enforcement, and he said he could not be impartial. A third was excused because he was very aware of the case, and, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nOnly one potential juror answered \"no\" to all the questions and moved on to the next phase. Another who was not dismissed said he holds a concealed carry permit and owns three handguns. The man said he has strong views on gun ownership and believes every law-abiding citizen should be able to own a gun.\n\n\"I believe the Second Amendment is very important,\" he explained.\n\nAttorneys jointly moved to dismiss a woman who expressed strong anti-gun views during questioning.\n\n\"I would like stronger laws in this country about certain types of weapons,\" she said. \"The ones with high repeat, you know, that kill children in schools.\"\n\nThe woman also said the government should require more background checks and make it harder to get a gun \"that can kill a lot of people at once.\"\n\n\"I would ban them altogether to be honest,\" acknowledged the woman, who also said she has donated to Democratic congressional candidates around the country and joined \"one of the resistance groups\" after the 2016 election.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first to the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court, and his wife Melissa. The president in Wilmington until he left for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nDefense attorneys have suggested they may argue that Hunter Biden didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They will also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

(AP) -- Jury selection is to begin Monday in a federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election.\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his father, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of Hunter Biden at https://apnews.com/hub/hunter-biden.\n\nMore from this section\n\nDocumentary Showcase Presents 'Liyana,' a Tale of

LiveNOW from FOX caught up with attorney Ken Belkin to talk about what's ahead.\n\nJury selection is beginning Monday in the trial of Hunter Biden, who has been charged with three felonies relating to a gun purchase.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after a plea deal to avoid trial, which was seen as special treatment by Republicans, fell apart.\n\nHe has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nThe charges all stem from a dark time in Biden's personal life where he has admitted he was addicted to crack.\n\nHere's what to know about Biden's past and how it connects to his gun trial:\n\nHunter Biden, 54, is the second son of U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nHis mother is Biden's first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden, who was killed in a car crash along with their 1-year-old baby girl, Hunter's sister, in 1972. Hunter and his older brother, Beau, were seriously hurt but survived.\n\nHunter went on to become an attorney, business and family man, though he admitted in his memoir \"Beautiful Things\" that he has struggled with alcohol and drug abuse throughout his life. Writings from his memoir will be seen as critical evidence by the prosecution in his gun trial.\n\nHunter's foreign business dealings have also been subject to federal investigation and are separate from this gun trial.\n\nBut, they were part of a larger plea deal, along with alleged tax crimes, that was going to spare him a politically explosive trial in the middle of his father's reelection campaign and likely prison time. That deal collapsed at the last minute last summer.\n\nIn July 2023, the plea deal unraveled after a federal judge raised concerns about the terms of the agreement, which had infuriated Republicans who believed the president's son was getting preferential treatment.\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers went back and forth over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August 2023, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nIn September 2023, Hunter Biden was indicted on three felonies related to his purchase of a firearm in 2018.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms when he checked a box indicating he was not an unlawful user of, or addicted to, any stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.\n\nThey have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved.\n\nThe contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\n\"I don't think this case is a slam dunk, per se,\" attorney Ken Belkin told LiveNOW from FOX.\n\n\"I mean, certainly some false statements were made on forms, but whether or not Hunter Biden actually knew at the time he was an addict - he was definitely using drugs; there's photographic evidence of that - but some of those people in the midst of their drug addiction, they're not, you know, at a point where they're ready to admit or they actively acknowledge or know that they are an addict.\"\n\nBelkin said this case revolves around the prosecution proving beyond reasonable doubt that Hunter Biden knew he was a drug addict when he purchased the gun.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers say he owned the gun for 11 days, never fired it, and that it ended up dumped in a trash can.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nOne witness who is expected to be called to testify in Hunter Biden's gun trial is Hallie Biden.\n\nHallie was married to Hunter's brother, Beau, until he passed away in 2015 from brain cancer.\n\nHallie's testimony will be relevant because she and Hunter became romantically involved in the time after Beau's death, when Hunter admitted descending into drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nHallie has also reportedly spoken about finding the gun and dumping it in a trash can, where it was ultimately discovered and turned over to authorities.\n\nThree other unknown witnesses are also on the docket, and could include Biden's first wife, Kathleen Buhle, who filed for a divorce in 2016, which is also around the relevant time period of Hunter's drug use.\n\nHunter Biden is currently married to Melissa Cohen, a South African filmmaker, and has been since 2019.\n\nThe two reportedly married in a secret wedding after knowing each other for one month.\n\nShe and Hunter did not know each other in October 2018 when Hunter purchased the gun, so it's unlikely she could provide relevant testimony and may not be called to testify.\n\nHunter Biden has spoken publicly - and under oath - about being sober from alcohol and drugs since June 2019.\n\nBiden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes.\n\nThat case would also have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July that ultimately collapsed.\n\nPossible cases on his alleged foreign business dealings are also pending.", "source": {"uri": "fox4news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 4 News Dallas-Fort Worth"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(AP) -- Jury selection is to begin Monday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son after a deal with prosecutors fell apart that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election.\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his father, has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment.\n\nThe trial comes just four days after Donald Trump was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City after a jury found him guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign.

Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a years-long investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned some unusual aspects of the deal that included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a \"diversion agreement\" on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective; Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad, and attending church together.\n\nBiden, in a last minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding the helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show he was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun - and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence Hunter Biden's published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos where he's often nude and doing drugs and highly personal messages where he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period where, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother Beau Biden from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018, and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

But last July, a plea bargain fell apart.\n\nIf found guilty, Biden could face 25 years in prison, though in practice such offenses, if not accompanied by other charges, are seldom punished by incarceration.\n\n- 'Rehabilitation' -\n\nJurors will hear about the defendant's drug use as prosecutors run through events that led to him buying the firearm in Delaware.\n\nThe defense team has pushed for narrow definitions of the terms \"addict\" and \"user,\" and requested instructions requiring an acquittal if the jury determines that the defendant did not consider himself to fit those definitions.\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" his lawyer Abbe Lowell wrote in court documents.\n\n\"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nAmong those reportedly expected to testify is the defendant's lover at the time of the firearm incident: Hallie Biden, the widow of Hunter's brother Beau Biden.\n\nHunter Biden, pictured in 2023, wrote in his memoir that he was \"smoking crack every 15 minutes\"\n\nThe case comes with Republicans pursuing an impeachment inquiry in Congress into what they claim is a Biden family criminal conspiracy, although they have provided no evidence.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have accused Hunter Biden of engaging in corrupt business practices in China and Ukraine, but he has not been charged with any crimes related to his foreign dealings.\n\nThe president has said he stands by his son and loves him for his attempts to recover from drug addiction.\n\nDemocratic congressman Adam Schiff, a Biden ally, told CNN Sunday that Americans should \"absolutely\" respect the jury's verdict, however it rules.\n\n\"And I think the president himself will respect the verdict -- much as it is painful, I'm sure, to see one of your children on trial.\"\n\nProsecutors have said they expect to take three days to present their case, and the untelevised trial will likely last about two weeks.\n\nHunter Biden faces separate tax evasion charges in California, in a case set for trial later this year.\n\nLast week Trump was convicted in a Manhattan court of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money paid to an adult film star.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type":

The case, brought by U.S. Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California.\n\nThe judge in the gun case, Maryellen Noreika, began screening potential jurors on Monday, many of whom disclosed they had family members or acquaintances with drug problems, including one juror who became emotional when discussing a brother-in-law with an addiction.\n\nFew jurors expressed strong political views.\n\nOne said he had worked with First Lady Jill Biden and said he had met \"Jill's husband\" multiple times. He also said he supported the campaign of Ferris Wharton, who ran unsuccessfully for Delaware attorney general against Beau Biden, Hunter's brother, who died of cancer in 2015.\n\nAll 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nJill Biden, Hunter Biden's wife Melissa Cohen Biden and his half-sister Ashley Biden were in attendance at the trial in Wilmington, before U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika.\n\n\"Jill and I love our son and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" Joe Biden said in a statement, adding that a lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction.\n\nThe trial comes days after Trump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House. Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday. The president, who had been expected to depart Rehoboth Beach on Monday, traveled on Sunday evening to his home in Wilmington.\n\nGUN PURCHASE\n\nThe case is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nProsecution lawyers revealed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter Biden's phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers. They said they may call as a witness his former wife Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they may try to show he had completed a drug rehabilitation program before purchasing the gun and may have considered his answer on the gun purchase form to be truthful.\n\nA plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Biden. Hunter Biden's lawyers blamed Republican pressure for the failure of the plea agreement.\n\nNoreika entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.\n\nThat testimony could have helped Biden show that he did not know he was lying on the background check form. The government is required to prove that Biden knowingly lied.\n\nCongressional Republicans spent years in vain trying to find evidence of a corrupt link between Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, including work for Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and his father's political power.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; additional reporting by Stephanie Kelly in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware; editing by Amy Stevens, Chizu Nomiyama, Nick Zieminski and Noeleen Walder)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update\n\nYour morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up\n\nView all of our newsletters.\n\nSuccess!

(AP) -- President Joe Biden's son Hunter arrived at court on Monday for jury selection in a federal gun case against him after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden arrived shortly after, entering the courthouse in support of her son.\n\nJoe Biden said that as president he wouldn't comment on the criminal trial but as a dad he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said in a statement. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first at the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court to support him.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

The trial is set to begin with jury selection on Monday at 8:30am in Delaware (12:30 GMT).\n\nThis is the first time that a child of a sitting president will be a criminal defendant, coming shortly after another historic first: the trial of a former US president, after Donald Trump went to court over a vase centred on hush money he paid adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump was convicted in the case on Thursday.\n\nHere is more about the upcoming Hunter Biden trial:\n\nThe younger Biden, 54, faces a three-count indictment over making false statements about his drug use to buy a gun back in 2018.\n\nHis indictment was filed on September 14, 2023 and brought by US Special Counsel David Weiss after a plea deal between Hunter Biden and Weiss imploded in July 2023. The deal would have erased gun charges in exchange for Biden pleading guilty to two tax charges. Under the deal, Biden would have avoided prison.\n\nIn October 2018, Hunter Biden purchased a Colt Cobra .38 special revolver from a gun shop called StarQuest Shooters & Survival Supply in Wilmington, Delaware -- a town that the Bidens call home.\n\nDelaware gun laws allow adults to purchase and own guns, but federal law requires the person seeking to purchase to fill out a Firearm Transaction Record form, or ATF Form 4473. The form requires details such as height, weight, birth date and declarations such as whether the purchaser is in the country unlawfully, has been convicted of a felony or admitted to a mental institution in the past.\n\nAmogn the questions on the form is: \"Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?\" with \"Yes\" and \"No\" options as answers. While purchasing the revolver in 2018, Hunter Biden allegedly selected \"No\" to this question. This was when the younger Biden was addicted to crack cocaine.\n\nHere are the three counts that he was indicted for:\n\nIf Hunter Biden is convicted on all charges, he could face a maximum punishment of 25 years in prison, according to the US Department of Justice.\n\nHowever, since he would be a first-time offender if convicted, he is likely to face a much lower sentence than the maximum stated.\n\nSince this is a federal case, Joe Biden could in theory pardon his son -- but the White House has explicitly ruled out this possibility.\n\nDistrict Judge Maryellen Noreika, 57, is overseeing this case.\n\nNoreika obtained her Juris Doctor (JD) from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law before specialising in patent law.\n\nShe was appointed by Trump in 2018 and her appointment was confirmed by a unanimous voice vote in the Senate.\n\nThe Hunter Biden trial will be in the Biden family's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. It will be held in the J Caleb Boggs Federal Building in Noreika's fourth-floor courtroom. Members of the public and media can access courtroom seats on a first come first served basis.\n\nApproximately 250 Delaware residents form the pool from which 12 seated jurors and four alternates will be shortlisted.\n\nThe jury selection process will involve prospective jurors being asked a series of questions including whether the jurors think Hunter Biden is being tried because his father is president; or whether the jurors have donated to political campaigns or run for office.\n\nFederal prosecutors have said they will present photographs and text message screenshots as evidence that Hunter Biden was an illegal drug user when he purchased the gun.\n\nSome of this evidence is believed to be on a laptop that the younger Biden abandoned at a computer repair store in Wilmington in 2019, from where it was seized by government authorities months later. The laptop is believed to have photos of Hunter Biden using drugs as well as messages exchanged with drug dealers.\n\nPotential key witnesses include Hallie Biden, who was the wife of Hunter's brother Beau, who passed away from cancer in 2015. Hunter and Hallie were in a relationship after Beau's passing.

Jury selection got underway, with the trial expected to last one to two weeks.\n\nPresident Biden said he and the first lady, who was marking her 73rd birthday Monday, were \"so proud\" of Hunter Biden.\n\n\"As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nThe trial comes days after a jury in New York made history by finding Donald Trump guilty of business fraud, the first time a former president has ever been criminally convicted.\n\nTrump, who is running as the Republican challenger to Joe Biden in November, faces three other far more serious criminal cases, including his alleged attempt to overthrow the 2020 presidential election.\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden attends the trial of her son Hunter Biden in Delaware\n\nThe Delaware trial -- along with another in which Hunter Biden faces charges in California on tax evasion -- is an embarrassment for Joe Biden, as he seeks a second term and hopes to keep the country's focus on Trump's behavior.\n\nIn addition to being a political distraction, Hunter Biden's legal woes will reopen painful emotional wounds for the family from his lengthy period as a serious drug addict -- a period that both he and his father have discussed publicly. Hunter Biden's brother Beau died from cancer in 2015 and his sister Naomi died as an infant in a 1972 car crash.\n\n- Addiction -\n\nUS President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who is to go on trial in June on gun charges\n\nThe Yale-trained lawyer and lobbyist-turned-artist is charged with falsely stating on legal paperwork when buying a .38 caliber Colt Cobra revolver in 2018 that he was not using drugs illegally. He is also charged with illegal possession of the firearm, which he had for just 11 days in October of that year.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty. He had earlier reached a plea deal with prosecutors but this collapsed, leading to the trial.\n\nProsecutors are set to introduce voluminous -- and often uncomfortable -- evidence linked to Hunter Biden's years as an addict.\n\nThey have called as witnesses three of his former partners, including Lunden Roberts, the mother of one of his children.\n\nThe president's son, who has written unsparingly about his addiction, will contend that at the moment he bought the revolver, he did not consider himself to be an addict. He has stated that he has been sober since 2019.\n\nIf found guilty, Hunter Biden could face 25 years in prison, although as a first-time offender he could get a far lighter sentence or escape any jail time.\n\nPresident Biden on Monday said that his son's difficulties would resonate widely.\n\n\"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\" he said.\n\n- Republican target -\n\nHunter Biden, pictured in 2023, wrote in his memoir that he was \"smoking crack every 15 minutes\"\n\nHunter Biden has long been the target of Trump and hard-right Republicans, amplified by exhaustive coverage on Fox News.\n\nLurid photos from his time as an addict have been leaked, and Trump allies have investigated him at length in Congress on allegations of corruption and influence-peddling. However, no charges have ever been brought.\n\nHunter Biden's messy private life and controversial foreign business dealings in China and Ukraine have also formed the basis for attempts by Republicans in Congress to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Biden. Those efforts too have gone nowhere.\n\nThe White House said last year that there would be no presidential pardon for Hunter Biden in case of a conviction.\n\nDemocratic congressman Adam Schiff, a Biden ally, told CNN Sunday that Americans should \"absolutely\" respect the jury's verdict.\n\n\"I think the president himself will respect the verdict -- much as it is painful, I'm sure, to see one of your children on trial.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden",

What is Hunter Biden's gun trial?", "body": "Hunter Biden, son of US President Joe Biden, departs the O'Neill House Office Building in Washington, US, 28 February, 2024. File Image/Reuters\n\nHunter Biden, the son of United States President Joe Biden, is set to stand trial on felony gun charges , marking a historic moment as no child of a sitting US president has ever faced such legal proceedings. The trial could have significant implications for Biden's re-election campaign.\n\nHere's an in-depth look at the case, including the charges, key players, and potential outcomes:\n\nWhat are the charges brought against Hunter Biden?\n\nHunter Biden, 54, faces three felony charges related to the purchase and possession of a firearm while he was allegedly addicted to drugs.\n\nThe indictment, brought by the Justice Department under special counsel David Weiss, accuses Biden of lying on a federal gun purchase form by denying his drug use. He possessed the gun for 11 days in October 2018 before his girlfriend disposed of it due to concerns over his mental state. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nThe charges include:\n\nNabeel Kibria, a defence attorney, told CNN, \"Guns present a danger if they get in the wrong hands, and that's the impetus behind these laws. The evidence seems pretty stacked against Hunter &mldr; but who determines who is an addict?\"\n\nHow far along is the trial?\n\nThe trial is taking place in Wilmington, Delaware, and is expected to last one to two weeks. Approximately 250 Delaware residents have been summoned for jury duty, with a final panel of 12 jurors and four alternates to be selected.\n\nDuring the selection process, potential jurors will be questioned about their ability to remain impartial given the high-profile nature of the case and their views on addiction and firearms.\n\nWho are the key witnesses and is there any evidence?\n\nProsecutors plan to call about a dozen witnesses, including three of Hunter Biden's former romantic partners: his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle, Hallie Biden (the widow of his late brother Beau Biden), and Lunden Roberts, the mother of one of his children. Their testimonies are expected to shed light on Biden's drug use during the period when he purchased the gun.\n\nHunter Biden's own words from his memoir and personal texts will also be used as evidence. In his memoir, Biden admitted to his struggles with addiction, stating he was almost always on drugs during that time.\n\nAlso Read: How Hunter Biden is threatening to sue Fox News for 'revenge porn'\n\nHis texts reveal a deep self-awareness of his condition, such as a message to Hallie Biden saying, \"I'm a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I've ruined every relationship I've ever cherished.\"\n\nAdditionally, evidence from Hunter Biden's infamous laptop, which contains messages and images that have been at the center of political controversy, will be presented. These materials include texts and emails that prosecutors argue support the claim that he was using illegal drugs when he bought the gun.\n\nWho are the prosecutors and the defence?\n\nThe case was initiated by David Weiss, a former Trump-appointed US attorney in Delaware, who was elevated to special counsel status by US Attorney General Merrick Garland. This followed the collapse of a proposed plea deal that would have resolved the gun charges and a separate tax investigation with a misdemeanor-only plea.\n\nHunter Biden's legal team argues that Weiss only sought the indictment due to pressure from Republican lawmakers, reported CNN. However, Weiss has dismissed these claims as \"fiction designed for a Hollywood script.\" The defence also planned to call an expert witness to testify about addiction but was blocked by the judge due to procedural issues.\n\nWhat are the potential outcomes for Hunter Biden?\n\nIf convicted on all three counts, Hunter Biden could face up to 25 years in prison. However, first-time offenders typically receive much lighter sentences. The final decision on his punishment will rest with US District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who has been presiding over the case with a no-nonsense approach.\n\nThe White House has ruled out the possibility of a pardon for Hunter Biden, although this stance could change after the November election. The trial's outcome could significantly impact Biden, who has expressed deep concern for his son's well-being.\n\nAlso Read | Trouble keeps finding him: The many legal and personal problems of Hunter Biden\n\nDouglas Brinkley, a CNN presidential historian, remarked, \"This trial is an albatross around President Biden's neck and weighs very heavily on his psyche. For any parent to watch their child go through addiction, and now face possible jail time, it's harrowing.\"\n\nWill the trial affect Joe Biden's re-election bid?\n\nThis trial is unprecedented in US history. While other presidential family members have faced legal troubles, none have been subjected to a criminal trial while their parent was in office.\n\nThe trial's proximity to the 2024 election adds a layer of political complexity. Biden's allies fear the trial could become a major distraction, especially as he campaigns under challenging poll numbers and prepares for upcoming presidential debates.\n\nIn addition to the gun charges, Hunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. This second trial, originally scheduled for June, was postponed but will coincide with the final stretch of the presidential campaign, further intensifying the political stakes.\n\nThe case not only holds personal significance for the Biden family but also carries potential repercussions for Joe Biden's 2024 political re-election campaign.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news",

He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment.\n\nThe trial comes just four days after Donald Trump was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City after a jury found him guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are not related, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a years-long investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned some unusual aspects of the deal that included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a \"diversion agreement\" on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective; Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad, and attending church together.\n\nBiden, in a last minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding the helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show he was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun - and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence Hunter Biden's published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos where he's often nude and doing drugs and highly personal messages where he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period where, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother Beau Biden from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018, and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.", "source": {"uri": "nationalnewswatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Newswatch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The judge in the case punched holes in the agreement, to the delight of Trump's allies in Congress who tried to scuttle that deal and have portrayed Hunter Biden's legal problems as equivalent to those of their party's 2024 presidential candidate in an effort to impeach President Joe Biden.\n\nStill, it is the son -- not the father -- who will be on trial twice during an election year. On Monday, he is set to report to the fourth-floor courtroom of Judge Maryellen Noreika when jury selection begins at 9 a.m. in a trial expected to last three to five days. The other, set to begin in September, involves a series of tax offenses related to his failure to file returns for a number of years.\n\nLast September, a federal grand jury charged Hunter Biden with three felonies: lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the federal firearms application used to screen applicants and possessing an illegally obtained gun for 11 days, from Oct. 12 to Oct. 23, 2018.\n\n\"Hunter Biden possessed a firearm while knowing he was an unlawful user of or addicted to any stimulant, narcotic drug or any other controlled substance, in violation of federal law,\" prosecutors said.\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison and $750,000 in fines. But nonviolent first-time offenders who have not been accused of using the weapon in another crime rarely get serious prison time for the charges. In fact, legal experts say it is more likely a sentence could include a central element of the original plea deal -- mandatory enrollment in a firearms diversion program intended to reduce incarceration rates for the least serious gun crimes.\n\nIt is also possible that the parties could reach another plea agreement, much narrower than the first, though Hunter Biden's legal team believes prosecutors are determined to bring the case to trial to avoid accusations that they are showing preferential treatment.\n\nAfter intense digging and unfounded accusations, Republicans in Congress have yet to prove that the president profited from his troubled son's dealings with a Ukrainian energy company. For now, they have abandoned their stated objective of impeaching the president, whom they claim, without evidence, is the leader of the \"Biden crime family.\"\n\nBut the spectacle of Hunter Biden's trial, and its timing, create significant headaches for Joe Biden's campaign, as it seeks to maximize the effect of Trump's conviction without the distraction of having a family member on trial days after Trump was officially designated a felon.\n\nIt also promises to be an excruciating personal ordeal for the president. The special counsel overseeing the prosecution, David Weiss, has signaled that he will air some of the Biden family's most embarrassing secrets by calling Hunter Biden's former wife, Kathleen Buhle, who is locked in a long legal battle with him over unpaid alimony, according to prosecutors.\n\nA top deputy to Weiss, Leo Wise, has filed court papers indicating that he also plans to call Hallie Biden, the widow of Hunter Biden's brother, Beau. Hallie Biden was dating Hunter Biden when he bought a handgun in 2018 while he was in the throes of drug addiction.\n\nThe gun charges are related to whether Hunter Biden had lied on a standard form issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, when he bought a .38-caliber pistol. Prosecutors said he falsely claimed he was not taking drugs at the time.\n\nHunter Biden had the gun for under two weeks, he has said, before Hallie tossed it into a dumpster, fearful that he would use it to harm himself.\n\nIt is relatively rare for such gun charges to be brought against a first-time, nonviolent offender like Hunter Biden, unless it is being used as leverage for a confession on other crimes, such as drug trafficking, current and former prosecutors have said.\n\nThe ATF officials who initially reviewed Hunter Biden's form believed the case would not have been prosecuted had it involved someone other than a Biden, particularly because Hunter Biden had taken steps to address his addiction, according to a former official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the investigation.\n\nHunter Biden has been sober for years and has written about his struggles with crack addiction and alcohol dependency in his memoir, which is likely to be used as evidence in both of his trials. Since the plea agreement fell apart, he has submitted to drug testing and passed, according to his lawyer Abbe Lowell.\n\nHow he plans to pay for his high-powered, high-priced legal representation in both trials remains an open question.\n\nHis main benefactor, who has shelled out nearly $7 million in loans to the president's son, has told associates he is running out of liquid assets. That has deepened a chronic cash crunch that has left his lawyers working for little or no compensation. Efforts to create a legal-defense fund have gone nowhere.\n\nNoreika, a Trump appointee, has indicated in preliminary judgments that she wants the proceeding to move quickly and be narrowly focused on Hunter Biden's actions at the time he completed the firearms application.\n\nShe has also ruled that his lawyers cannot refer to the fact that local authorities declined to prosecute him when the gun was recovered. She also blocked Weiss from making any reference to the tax case when presenting evidence in Delaware.\n\nLast month, the federal judge in Los Angeles who is presiding over the tax case agreed to push the start of that trial from later this month to Sept. 5, giving Hunter Biden's lawyers room to prepare.\n\nWhile the move came as a relief to Joe Biden's son, it thrusts a trial that is likely to highlight Hunter's Biden's efforts to leverage his family's name into profit into the homestretch of the campaign season.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to charges of evading a tax assessment, failing to file and pay taxes, and filing a false or fraudulent tax return.", "source": {"uri": "nytlicensing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spokesman.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Ahead of the trial beginning, Mr. Biden issued a statement saying \"I am the president, but I am also a dad.\" Mr. Biden said he and Jill Biden will \"continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\"\n\nLate Sunday night, Judge Maryellen Norieka declined to allow Hunter Biden's lawyers to admit into evidence a second version of the firearms purchase form he filled out to buy the gun. His attorney, Abbe Lowell, claimed new information had been added to that second version after the criminal investigation had begun, including information about the types of identification Hunter Biden had presented. Norieka noted in her order that on both forms, \"no\" was checked next to the question about whether the applicant was an \"unlawful user or addict.\"\n\nThe president's son was indicted by a federal grand jury in September after a diversion agreement for a felony gun offense and a plea deal related to misdemeanor tax charges unraveled when U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned whether the agreement would allow him to avoid potential future charges.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys decried the charges and argued they were \"unconstitutional\" and \"unprecedented,\" as well as in violation of the diversion agreement they maintain was still legally binding and valid.\n\nA flurry of motions to dismiss filed by Hunter Biden's attorneys were denied by Judge Noreika, and a federal appeals court rejected his motion to dismiss the gun charges in May.\n\nIn the three-count indictment, the president's son is charged with making false statements on a federal gun form about his drug use, certifying he was not a user of or addicted to any controlled substance during a period when prosecutors allege he was addicted to crack cocaine. Biden purchased a Colt Cobra .38 Special revolver, and it remained in his possession for 11 days before it was discarded in an outdoor receptacle by Hallie Biden, Hunter Biden's romantic partner at the time.\n\nProsecutors are expected to introduce evidence that details Biden's use of controlled substances leading up to and during the period he purchased the firearm. In their trial brief, they reference Biden's own admission of drug addiction in excerpts from his memoir, Beautiful Things, as well as photos and videos from his laptop and text messages.\n\nProsecutors also intend to include testimony from Hunter Biden's former romantic partners recounting his substance abuse, including his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle and Hallie Biden, the widow of his late brother, Beau Biden, and expert testimony from FBI and DEA agents.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys seek to call their own expert witnesses on addiction and forensic psychiatry and forensic toxicology.\n\nThe charges were brought by special counsel David Weiss who was appointed U.S. attorney for Delaware by former President Donald Trump and named special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2023. Federal probes into Hunter Biden, led by Weiss, spanned five years over the course of both the Trump and Biden administrations.\n\nAttorneys for Hunter Biden asserted that Weiss \"buckled under political pressure to bring more severe charges\" after the plea agreement elicited a \"sharp rebuke\" from former President Trump and his Republican allies when it was first made public. Weiss' office slammed claims that the charges were fueled by politics and were pursued to appease Republicans.\n\n\"The charges in this case are not trumped up or because of former President Trump -- they are instead a result of the defendant's own choices and were brought in spite of, not because of, any outside noise made by politicians,\" prosecutors said.\n\nHunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison and $750,000 in fines if convicted on all counts.\n\nSeparately, he faces nine federal tax charges in the central district of California in a second indictment brought by Weiss' office where federal prosecutors allege President Biden's son engaged in a \"four-year scheme\" to avoid paying at least $1.4 million in federal taxes.\n\nHunter Biden is charged with three felony and six misdemeanor charges related to his alleged failure to file and pay taxes, evasion of assessment, and filing a false or fraudulent tax return. Biden has pleaded not guilty to those charges.\n\nHis motions to dismiss the federal tax charges were all denied by U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi in April. If convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 17 years in prison.\n\nReferences to the tax charges or questioning related to those charges or the plea hearing are not admissible in his federal gun trial in Delaware.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5,

(AP) -- A federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter opened Monday with jury selection, following the collapse of a plea deal that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden was seated in the front row of the courtroom, in a show of support for her son.\n\nIn a statement, the president said he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants by saying he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nIn Delaware, prospective jurors who answered \"yes\" on a questionnaire were quizzed individually by Judge Maryellen Noreika to determine whether they could be fair and impartial. One by one, they were dismissed, winnowing down the pool.\n\nThe questions ranged from their knowledge of the case to their thoughts about gun ownership and whether they or anyone close to them have struggled with substance abuse or addiction or ever owned a gun. Other questions focused on the role politics may have played in the charges.\n\nOne prospective juror said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she replied when an attorney asked her opinion. Another prospective juror was dismissed because his family has a long history in law enforcement, and he said he could not be impartial. A third was excused because he was very aware of the case, and, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nOnly one potential juror answered \"no\" to all the questions and moved on to the next phase. Another who was not dismissed said he holds a concealed carry permit and owns three handguns. The man said he has strong views on gun ownership and believes every law-abiding citizen should be able to own a gun.\n\n\"I believe the Second Amendment is very important,\" he explained.\n\nAttorneys jointly moved to dismiss a woman who expressed strong anti-gun views during questioning.\n\n\"I would like stronger laws in this country about certain types of weapons,\" she said. \"The ones with high repeat, you know, that kill children in schools.\"\n\nThe woman also said the government should require more background checks and make it harder to get a gun \"that can kill a lot of people at once.\"\n\n\"I would ban them altogether to be honest,\" acknowledged the woman, who also said she has donated to Democratic congressional candidates around the country and joined \"one of the resistance groups\" after the 2016 election.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first to the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court, and his wife Melissa. The president in Wilmington until he left for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nDefense attorneys have suggested they may argue that Hunter Biden didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They will also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

Facing three felony gun charges, President Joe Biden's son has pleaded not guilty. The case, overseen by U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, coincides with notable political events, including Donald Trump's own legal troubles.\n\nThe criminal trial of Hunter Biden kicks off on Monday in federal court in Delaware as President Joe Biden's son faces gun charges in a historic case that begins four days after Donald Trump became the first former U.S. president to be convicted.\n\nIn the first trial of the child of a sitting president, Hunter Biden, 54, faces three felony charges stemming from his purchase and possession of a revolver in 2018. He has pleaded not guilty. It is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California. The trial in Wilmington, with U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika presiding, begins with the jury selection process.\n\nTrump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York on Thursday of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House. Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the Nov. 5 U.S. election. Hunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.\n\nHunter Biden was charged last September in the case brought by U.S. Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018. Weiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges. If convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday in the sunny beach town.

He has pleaded not guilty. It is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California.\n\nThe trial in Wilmington, with U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika presiding, begins with the jury selection process.\n\nTrump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York on Thursday of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House. Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.\n\nHunter Biden was charged last September in the case brought by U.S. Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018. Weiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday in the sunny beach town. The president, who had been expected to depart Rehoboth Beach on Monday, traveled on Sunday evening to his home in Wilmington.\n\nPotential jurors will be screened for their ability to commit to serving the length of the trial, which is expected to run through the end of next week. All 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nThe case is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nProsecution lawyers revealed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter Biden's phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers. They said they may call as a witness his former wife Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they may try to show he had completed a drug rehabilitation program before purchasing the gun and may have considered his answer on the gun purchase form to be truthful.\n\nA plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Biden.

A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of Hunter Biden at https://apnews.com/hub/hunter-biden.\n\nRandall Chase, Claudia Lauer, Michael Kunzelman And Colleen Long, The

He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment.\n\nThe trial comes just four days after Donald Trump was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City after a jury found him guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are not related, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a years-long investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned some unusual aspects of the deal that included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a \"diversion agreement\" on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective; Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad, and attending church together.\n\nBiden, in a last minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding the helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show he was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun - and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence Hunter Biden's published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos where he's often nude and doing drugs and highly personal messages where he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period where, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother Beau Biden from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018, and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type":

However, the now-nixed guilty plea offer spectacularly fell apart after the judge presiding over the criminal proceedings -- Judge Maryellen Noreika, a Trump appointee -- called B.S. on the eyebrow-raising arrangement, which would've allowed Hunter Biden to avoid any jail time.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to begin Monday morning with jury selection at the federal courthouse in President Joe Biden's backyard -- Wilmington, Delaware. It's supposed to last three to six days, but the introduction of Hunter Biden's infamous laptop into evidence on an item-by-item basis, meaning the defense is permitted to raise objections to each piece of evidence extracted from the device, could spark feuds between parties and stretch the trial far past the one-week timeframe we're expecting.\n\nTownhall will be there all week, so stay tuned for live updates from inside the courtroom.\n\nThe three felony firearm charges can be boiled down to Hunter Biden allegedly deceiving a federally licensed firearms dealer, falsely denying his drug addiction on a federal firearms form, and unlawfully possessing the gun that he, thereby, illegally bought.\n\nIf convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison, plus $750,000 fines and almost a decade of supervised release.\n\nSpecial counsel David C. Weiss, a Trump-nominated prosecutor retained by the Biden administration, is spearheading the prosecution, which will have to prove that Hunter Biden knowingly lied about his crack addiction on the background check.\n\nThe much-anticipated jury trial is expected to delve into Hunter Biden's drug use in relation to when he purchased the .38 special revolver that authorities found after it was thrown into the trash can of a Wilmington-area grocery store, the Janssen's Market.\n\nIn mid-October 2018, Hunter Biden bought the Colt Cobra at the StarQuest Shooters & Survival Supply gun shop. Any person who purchases a firearm has to fill out paperwork (a Firearms Transaction Record, a.k.a. \"ATF Form 4473\") required by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). On that background check form, Hunter Biden was asked whether he was an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance, such as crack cocaine; he answered, \"No,\" to the question.\n\nLast week, Judge Noreika barred Hunter Biden's defense attorneys from arguing or suggesting that the prosecution must demonstrate that he did drugs on the day of the gun's purchase. According to ATF's regulations, the prosecutors simply need to show that the substance abuse \"occurred recently enough to indicate that the individual is actively engaged in such conduct.\"\n\nThe defense is still disputing what definitions jurors will work with. In a court filing Wednesday, the defense attorneys submitted arguments asking for additional revisions to the jury instructions, asserting that Hunter Biden's understanding of what those terms -- drug \"user\" and \"addict\" -- meant determines whether he \"knowingly\" believed he was either one at the time of the gun's sale.\n\n\"Words sometimes are understood to have different meanings to different people...\" Hunter Biden's counsel wrote, attempting to raise a \"good faith\" defense. \"It does not matter whether you or Congress or anyone else would define the defendant as an 'addict' or 'user of controlled substances,' if Mr. Biden did not understand that he was an 'addict' or 'user of a controlled substance' at the time of the alleged charges, he did not knowingly break the law then either and he must be found not guilty.\"\n\nThe mountain of evidence the prosecution has accumulated against Hunter Biden includes his own admissions he published in his memoir, Beautiful Things, where he extensively talked about his \"four years of active addiction\" spanning from 2015 to 2019.\n\nExcerpts that prosecutors cite in court documents range from Hunter Biden's recounting of rehab and relapses to his self-identification as a crack addict who spent \"twenty-four hours a day, smoking every fifteen minutes, seven days a week.\"\n\nAs for the defense, Hunter Biden unsuccessfully sought to toss out the case on grounds that the charges are legally defective. He also failed to outright bar the laptop from being into evidence, claiming it had been hacked and seeded with false information. \"[T]he data had been altered and compromised before investigators obtained the electronic material...\" the defense had asserted.\n\nHunter Biden's high-profile lawyer, Abbe Lowell, who previously represented Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) in his federal corruption case, is heavily relying on the argument that the user/addict terms were \"not defined on the form and were not explained to him.\"\n\n\"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict,\" Lowell wrote in response to the prosecution's 20-page trial brief.\n\nThe prosecution intends to call on witnesses close to Hunter Biden.\n\nAlthough they're only identified as Witness 1, Witness 2, and Witness 3, it can be inferred based on the information the prosecution provided ahead of trial that they're Hunter Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle; the widow of Hunter Biden's brother, Hallie Biden, with whom he had an affair; and his baby mama, Lunden Roberts, with whom he fathered five-year-old Navy Joan.\n\nRoberts successfully sued Hunter Biden, who had denied paternity, for being a deadbeat dad, forcing him to pay child support. Navy, the seventh grandchild of President Biden, has been repeatedly snubbed by both Hunter Biden and the Biden family.\n\nRoberts will testify that she \"observed the defendant using crack cocaine frequently -- every 20 minutes except when he slept.\"\n\nDays before Hallie Biden's expected testimony, President Biden reportedly visited his daughter-in-law near the ninth anniversary of Beau Biden's death. Hallie Biden had allegedly discarded the handgun that was recovered from the local shop's dumpster.\n\nThis week, Judge Noreika swatted down Hunter Biden's last-ditch bid to stop the case from heading to trial, calling the attempt \"frivolous\" and finding \"no reason to believe\" that the defense's appeal would be \"any more meritorious than his prior efforts.\"\n\nHunter Biden's May 14 motion to enjoin the special counsel's investigation and prosecution of him claimed that the use of congressional appropriations to fund Weiss was unconstitutional because the prosecutor is not an \"independent counsel.\"\n\n\"Somewhat incongruously, [Biden] has asserted in this case both that he is being selectively prosecuted by a Special Counsel 'making prosecutorial decisions for political reasons,' and that the Special Counsel making those decisions is not actually independent from the Attorney General appointed by his father or the Executive Branch headed by his father,\" Noreika ruled.\n\nAt the pre-trial conference, Lowell asked whether Hunter Biden could participate in any attorney-judge sidebars near the judge's bench at trial. NBC News reported that he is allowed to \"wander\" around the courtroom, a freedom that not all defendants have.\n\nHunter Biden is separately staving off tax evasion charges in a California case slated to go to trial this fall.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mia_cathell@townhall.com", "name": "Mia Cathell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco,_Firearms_and_Explosives", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Controlled substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_C._Weiss", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David C.

The indictment was brought by the Justice Department, specifically by David Weiss, the special counsel appointed last year to oversee the Hunter Biden probes.\n\nHunter Biden, 54, is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He pleaded not guilty to the three charges, though he has been open about his struggles with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction.\n\nThe trial could last one to two weeks and is taking place in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWhat are the charges?\n\nThe first two charges in the three-count indictment are tied to the gun purchase itself.\n\nWhen a person buys a gun, they must fill out a form with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and affirm that they are legally allowed to buy the weapon. Hunter Biden has been charged with lying on those forms.\n\nThese questions include: Have you been convicted of a felony? Are you a fugitive? Are you in the country unlawfully? And, importantly for this case, are you an \"unlawful user of, or addicted to\" illegal drugs? Hunter Biden allegedly checked the box that said, \"No.\"\n\nCount 3 relates to the possession of the gun. It's also against federal law to possess a gun if you are abusing drugs. Hunter Biden had the gun for 11 days in October 2018, before his girlfriend threw it in a dumpster because she was worried about his mental health, according to the indictment and texts made public in recent court filings.\n\n\"Guns present a danger if they get in the wrong hands, and that's the impetus behind these laws,\" Nabeel Kibria, a Washington, DC-based defense attorney who has handled hundreds of gun cases, told CNN. \"The evidence seems pretty stacked against Hunter ... but who determines who is an addict? What are the bright-line rules that must be followed?\"\n\nWho are the witnesses?\n\nProsecutors have said they plan to call about a dozen witnesses for their case.\n\nMost notably, they've lined up testimony from three of Hunter Biden's former romantic partners to testify about his drug use around the time he bought the gun. This includes his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle; his late brother's widow, Hallie Biden, whom Hunter Biden later dated; and Lunden Roberts, the mother of one of his children.\n\nTheir testimony could bring to life a period that Hunter Biden has described as his rock bottom, during which he was almost always on drugs or trying to get drugs. At his attempted plea hearing last year, Hunter Biden testified that he has been sober since May 2019.\n\n\"He's going to experience stress and shame at the trial,\" said Valerie Earnshaw, a social psychology professor at the University of Delaware who researches the stigmas surrounding addiction. \"It depends on his own recovery journey, but there could be days where he experiences a lot of shame. It's a toxic emotion that eats you up. It does not motivate healthy behaviors.\"\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers said they might call an expert who can tell the jury about how people with addictions understand their own struggles. His team also has a forensic chemist who could testify about a white residue on his gun pouch that prosecutors say testified positive for cocaine when it was analyzed by the FBI in 2023.\n\nWho are the prosecutors?\n\nThe case was initiated by Weiss, the former Donald Trump-appointed US attorney in Delaware. Attorney General Merrick Garland elevated Weiss to special counsel status last year, after a proposed plea deal with Hunter Biden blew up in spectacular fashion.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers claimed Weiss only sought the indictment because he caved to a relentless pressure campaign from Republican lawmakers and the former president. Weiss panned this theory as a \"fiction designed for a Hollywood script,\" and the judge overseeing the gun case concluded the allegations were \"nonsensical under the facts here.\"\n\nBut many Republicans have criticized Weiss, claiming he offered Hunter Biden a \"sweetheart deal\" last year that would have resolved the gun matter and ended a tax probe with a misdemeanor-only plea. (Legal experts told CNN at the time that the proposed deal was reasonable.)\n\nWho is the judge?\n\nDistrict Judge Maryellen Noreika is presiding over the case. A former patent lawyer, she had the support of Delaware's two Democratic senators when she was appointed by Trump. The Senate confirmed her nomination with a unanimous voice vote in 2018.\n\nShe oversaw last summer's dramatic hearing during which both sides asked her to approve a plea deal. But she balked and uncovered through tough questioning that there were grave differences between the parties about the scope of the deal. That hearing ended without a resolution, and the plea discussions later collapsed. That's when Garland named Weiss as special counsel.\n\nNoreika's no-nonsense approach has kept the proceedings moving in a steady fashion. She rejected Hunter Biden's attempts to toss the case or derail the prosecution but has sided with him on several key evidentiary questions.\n\nCould Hunter Biden go to prison?\n\nIf convicted on all three counts, the president's son could face up to 25 years in prison.\n\nHowever, he doesn't have a prior criminal record, and first-time offenders often get much lower sentences than the maximum. His punishment would be solely up to Noreika.\n\nThese are federal charges, so Joe Biden has the power to pardon his son at any time. If his son is convicted, the president could also commute the sentence, sparing him from the levied punishment.\n\nThe White House has explicitly ruled out the possibility of a pardon, but that political calculus could change after the November election.\n\nHas this ever happened before?\n\nThis is a historic moment for the United States and the history of the presidency. No president has ever tried to run the country while watching his own child go on trial.\n\nOver the decades, there are plenty of examples of presidential family members getting in trouble. George H. W. Bush's son faced civil penalties for violating banking laws while his father was serving in the White House. Jimmy Carter's brother was scrutinized for his foreign lobbying. But nothing has sunk to the level of a criminal trial.\n\nCNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said that \"there's always somebody considered a black sheep in the presidential family\" but that Hunter Biden's sprawling legal issues \"cut unusually close to the bone because it's the president's son.\"\n\n\"This trial is an albatross around President Biden's neck and weighs very heavily on his psyche,\" Brinkley said. \"For any parent to watch their child go through addiction, and now face possible jail time, it's harrowing. You would hope that family would be his comfort zone. But in this case, family is probably his biggest worry of the moment.\"\n\nThe family ties have also led to some intriguing divergences between father and son.\n\nThere is a separate court battle over the constitutionality of the law that makes it illegal for drug users to own a gun. The Biden administration is defending the law and wants the Supreme Court to take up the matter. But Hunter Biden's team argued in his case - unsuccessfully - that the law violates the Second Amendment.\n\nThe jury pool\n\nApproximately 250 Delaware residents have been summoned for jury service, according to the judge. They'll be whittled down to a panel of 12 seated jurors and four alternates.\n\nDelaware is one of the smallest states in the country, and the Biden family looms large.\n\nAs part of the selection process - called voir dire - prospective jurors will be asked whether they can stay impartial regardless of their views about the 2024 election. They'll also be asked whether they can keep an open mind about Hunter Biden and even whether they've been eligible to vote in past elections for Joe Biden, who has held public office in Delaware since 1971.\n\nOther questions touch on the highly politicized atmosphere surrounding the case, including, \"Do you believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted in this case because his father is the President of the United States?\" or, coming from the other side, whether they think he \"is not being prosecuted for other crimes because his father is the President.\"\n\nWhat has Hunter Biden said?\n\nSince his indictments last year, Hunter Biden hasn't said much about his legal cases.\n\nHe spoke out in December amid his fight with the House Republicans who are probing his business dealings and took responsibility for having \"made mistakes in my life and wasted opportunities and privileges that I was afforded.\" But he slammed the \"MAGA right\" lawmakers who \"ridiculed my struggle with addiction\" and \"belittled my recovery.\"\n\n\"They have tried to dehumanize me, all to embarrass and damage my father,\" he said.\n\nPreviously, Hunter Biden shared intensely personal details about his addiction in his 2021 memoir, which prosecutors plan to use against him at trial. He described his stints in rehab, his relapses, how he bought drugs near the White House, and the stretches of time when he \"had no plan beyond the moment-to-moment demands of the crack pipe.\"\n\nThe laptop, texts and emails\n\nOne of the most notable pieces of evidence in the case will be messages from Hunter Biden's infamous laptop, which has been at the center of a yearslong political saga. Weiss said the material \"is real\" and will be an important part of his case, rebutting past claims from the president's son that the laptop might be fake or even Russian disinformation.\n\nRepublican officials and right-wing outlets have seized on the laptop's embarrassing emails and sexually explicit images to attack Hunter Biden, while his lawyers say the files were manipulated and sued a repair-shop owner who helped make the materials public.\n\nMany on the right celebrated this move by Weiss, even if he hasn't verified their loftier anti-Biden allegations. The New York Post, the conservative tabloid that was first to publish messages from the laptop in 2020, recently took a victory lap on its front cover.\n\nIn a ruling last month, Noreika said she'll let Hunter Biden challenge the authenticity of any messages introduced at trial. Some of the texts contain gut-wrenching arguments between Hunter Biden and his loved ones about his sobriety. Others show him meeting up with drug dealers, including some just a few blocks from the Wilmington federal courthouse.\n\n\"I'm a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I've ruined every relationship I've ever cherished,\" he texted Hallie Biden in October 2018, according to Weiss' filings.\n\nProsecutors plan to use the laptop to specifically support their claim that he was using illegal drugs when he bought the gun in 2018. Weiss has not addressed - and the case is not about - Republicans' unproven allegation that emails from the laptop prove that Hunter Biden and his father were involved in corrupt foreign business deals.\n\nWhat about the tax charges?\n\nThis is just one of two trials Hunter Biden faces this year.\n\nThe second case is scheduled for September in Los Angeles and revolves around Hunter Biden's troubled finances. He has pleaded not guilty to tax evasion, filing false tax returns and failing to file his taxes on time.\n\nOriginally, the trials were both scheduled for June, but Hunter Biden got a reprieve from the California federal judge, who agreed to postpone that trial. But the September trial date means that case will coincide with the final stretch of the presidential campaign.\n\nCNN's Holmes Lybrand contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

First lady Jill Biden arrived shortly after him. As the first lady departed the main courtroom during the late-morning break, Hunter Biden hugged her and kissed her on the cheek. She returned his embrace, touching his face. Hunter Biden and his wife then exited the room holding hands.\n\nPresident Biden is not at the hearing; he's scheduled to attend a fundraiser in Connecticut Monday evening. But he did issue a statement, declining to weigh in on the trial but offering a statement of support for his son.\n\n\"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" his statement read. \"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean.\"\n\nThe president's son was indicted by a federal grand jury in September after a diversion agreement for a felony gun offense and a plea deal related to misdemeanor tax charges unraveled when U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned whether the agreement would allow him to avoid potential future charges.\n\nLate Sunday night, Norieka declined to allow Hunter Biden's lawyers to admit into evidence a second version of the firearms purchase form he filled out to buy the gun. His attorney, Abbe Lowell, claimed new information had been added to that second version after the criminal investigation had begun, including information about the types of identification Hunter Biden had presented. Norieka noted in her order that on both forms, \"no\" was checked next to the question about whether the applicant was an \"unlawful user or addict.\"\n\nIn a separate order the same day, Norieka also granted the government's motion to exclude one of the defense's expert witnesses, Dr. Elie Aoun, who was to testify on the nature of Hunter Biden's drug abuse and whether he understood himself to be an addict. She has reserved her opinion on whether to allow the testimony of another expert witness, Michael Lee Coyer.\n\nThroughout jury selection, Hunter Biden sat attentively, periodically taking notes. The first lady directly behind him, sharing the first row with his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, half-sister Ashley Biden and Hollywood attorney and ally Kevin Morris. The first family largely did not react as jurors answered questions.\n\nAll but one juror was made aware of the case by news reports, and many said they had an immediate connection to someone struggling with drug and alcohol abuse. By 11:45 a.m. ET, 12 potential jurors out of 30 were excused for cause, including scheduling conflicts and political views. One person asserted gun ownership was a \"God-given right,\" while another said her opinion of the Bidens was \"not a good one.\"\n\nThe defense struck another potential juror, too, a former Wilmington police officer who said he is a Fox News viewer, said he is an acquaintance of Jill Biden's, having worked with her at the college where she taught. He also said he's met Mr. Biden at multiple events and donated to a challenger to Beau Biden in his race to be Delaware attorney general. The potential juror also told the judge that he believes prosecutors file cases for political reasons, mentioning the criminal case against former President Donald Trump in New York, and when asked if \"political prosecutions\" ever target Democrats, he offered an emphatic \"no\" in response.\n\nOther potential jurors also answered \"yes\" when the judge asked \"are some Department of Justice and law enforcement probes politically motivated?\" A series of them cited Trump's New York case.\n\nIn the three-count indictment, the president's son is charged with making false statements on a federal gun form about his drug use, certifying he was not a user of or addicted to any controlled substance during a period when prosecutors allege he was addicted to crack cocaine. Biden purchased a Colt Cobra .38 Special revolver, and it remained in his possession for 11 days before it was discarded in an outdoor receptacle by Hallie Biden, Hunter Biden's romantic partner at the time.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys have decried the charges and argued they were \"unconstitutional\" and \"unprecedented,\" as well as in violation of the diversion agreement they maintain was still legally binding and valid.\n\nA flurry of motions to dismiss filed by Hunter Biden's attorneys were denied by Judge Noreika, and a federal appeals court rejected his motion to dismiss the gun charges in May.\n\nProsecutors are expected to introduce evidence that details Hunter Biden's use of controlled substances leading up to and during the period he purchased the firearm. In their trial brief, they reference his own admission of drug addiction in excerpts from his memoir, Beautiful Things, as well as photos and videos from his laptop and text messages.\n\nThe government also intends to include testimony from Hunter Biden's former romantic partners recounting his substance abuse, including his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle and Hallie Biden, the widow of his late brother, Beau Biden, and expert testimony from FBI and DEA agents.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys seek to call their own expert witnesses on addiction and forensic psychiatry and forensic toxicology.\n\nThe charges were brought by special counsel David Weiss who was appointed U.S. attorney for Delaware by former President Donald Trump and named special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2023. Federal probes into Hunter Biden, led by Weiss, spanned five years over the course of both the Trump and Biden administrations.\n\nAttorneys for Hunter Biden asserted that Weiss \"buckled under political pressure to bring more severe charges\" after the plea agreement elicited a \"sharp rebuke\" from former President Trump and his Republican allies when it was first made public. Weiss' office slammed claims that the charges were fueled by politics and were pursued to appease Republicans.\n\n\"The charges in this case are not trumped up or because of former President Trump -- they are instead a result of the defendant's own choices and were brought in spite of, not because of, any outside noise made by politicians,\" prosecutors said.\n\nHunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison and $750,000 in fines if convicted on all counts.\n\nSeparately, he faces nine federal tax charges in the central district of California in a second indictment brought by Weiss' office where federal prosecutors allege President Biden's son engaged in a \"four-year scheme\" to avoid paying at least $1.4 million in federal taxes.\n\nHunter Biden is charged with three felony and six misdemeanor charges related to his alleged failure to file and pay taxes, evasion of assessment, and filing a false or fraudulent tax return. Biden has pleaded not guilty to those charges.\n\nHis motions to dismiss the federal tax charges were all denied by U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi in April. If convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 17 years in prison.\n\nReferences to the tax charges or questioning related to those charges or the plea hearing are not admissible in his federal gun trial in Delaware.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5,

The first son pleaded not guilty to the charges, which could land Hunter Biden in prison for up to 25 years if he is convicted.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden joined Hunter Biden and his wife, Melissa Cohen, at the courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware, for the first day of the trial. The Washington Post reported that the judge predicted jury selection could last until Wednesday and the trial is estimated to last up to two weeks.\n\nWitnesses may include Hunter Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, and his late brother Beau Biden's wife, Hallie Biden, with whom Hunter Biden had a relationship after Beau Biden died of brain cancer in 2015. Hallie Biden, whose public disposal of the gun led up to the charges, received a visit from President Biden at her home last week.\n\nThe trial in Delaware begins this week after a judge rejected Hunter Biden's bid to delay the prosecution.

He had earlier reached a plea deal with prosecutors but this collapsed, leading to the trial.\n\nProsecutors are set to introduce voluminous -- and often uncomfortable -- evidence linked to Hunter Biden's years as an addict.\n\nThey have called as witnesses three of his former partners, including Lunden Roberts, the mother of one of his children.\n\nThe president's son, who has written unsparingly about his addiction, will contend that at the moment he bought the revolver, he did not consider himself to be an addict. He has stated that he has been sober since 2019.\n\nIf found guilty, Hunter Biden could face 25 years in prison, although as a first-time offender he could get a far lighter sentence or escape any jail time. He could also face fines of up to $750,000.\n\nPresident Biden on Monday said that his son's difficulties would resonate widely.\n\n\"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\" he said.\n\n- Republican target -\n\nHunter Biden has long been the target of Trump and hard-right Republicans, amplified by exhaustive coverage on Fox News.\n\nLurid photos from his time as an addict have been leaked, and Trump allies have investigated him at length in Congress on allegations of corruption and influence-peddling. However, no charges have ever been brought.\n\nHunter Biden's messy private life and controversial foreign business dealings in China and Ukraine have also formed the basis for attempts by Republicans in Congress to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Biden. Those efforts too have gone nowhere.\n\nThe White House said last year that there would be no presidential pardon for Hunter Biden in case of a conviction.\n\nDemocratic congressman Adam Schiff, a Biden ally, told CNN Sunday that Americans should \"absolutely\" respect the jury's verdict.\n\n\"I think the president himself will respect the verdict -- much as it is painful, I'm sure, to see one of your children on trial.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person",

In a statement, the president said that as a father he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength\".\n\nProsecutors allege that Hunter Biden lied about his drug use on application forms when he purchased a handgun in 2018, while in the throes of addiction.\n\nIn theory, he could face a hefty jail sentence, but it is widely seen as highly unlikely.\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" Biden said, noting that he would not comment further on the case. The president's youngest and only surviving son, Hunter has long struggled with drug addiction and a troubled private life, which is now at the center of the federal case.\n\n\"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" Biden wrote. \"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us.\"\n\nThe president's son has acknowledged being addicted to crack cocaine during that period in 2018, but his lawyers have said he didn't break the law. In his memoir Beautiful Things, he described becoming consumed by drugs and alcohol after his older brother, Beau, died in 2015 at age 46 from brain cancer. The brothers were very close, having survived a car crash when they were young that killed their mother and baby sister.\n\nRelated: Hunter Biden gun trial to begin next month after judge denies bid to delay\n\nHunter Biden has said he has been sober since 2019. But prosecutors intend to use his memoir to make the case that he knew he was addicted to drugs when he denied it on the form that every person must fill out when buying a gun.\n\nA plea deal aimed at avoiding a trial collapsed last year, though it is possible some form of pact could still be revived as the trial starts to play out. But one thing seen as certain this is that Republicans will use Hunter Biden's trial - and another more serious one over tax issues set for September - as a weapon to attack Joe Biden, as they have sought to do for several years.\n\nRepublicans will no doubt be motivated by Trump's host of legal travails. The former president seen as a lock to be the party's 2024 nominee was found guilty last week of falsifying business records linked to hush-money payments to adult film actor Stormy Daniels to cover an affair that was seen as potentially harming his 2016 election prospects. Like Hunter Biden, Trump too could face jail, though that also is seen as unlikely.\n\nThe timing of the trial is unfortunate for Democrats, who are seeking to highlight Trump's historic first of being the only US president to become a felon. But Joe Biden, in keeping with his reputation as a close family man, has stuck by Hunter Biden through all his troubles and that is unlikely to change during the trial which is expected to last a week or so.\n\nHowever, the trial could air potentially embarrassing family details.\n\nDavid C Weiss, special counsel overseeing the prosecution, has signaled he will call Hunter Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, to the stand. Prosecutors also may call Hallie Biden, the widow of Joe Biden's son Beau, who died of brain cancer. Hallie Biden was dating Hunter Biden when he bought a handgun in 2018.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crack cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Traffic collision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Buhle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kathleen Buhle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brain tumor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show_Jumping", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show Jumping", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual_Addiction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual Addiction", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/e24194f3344f1071a1feed36f39a5498", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The culmination of a sprawling investigation, the deal between Hunter Biden and prosecutors was going to spare him a politically explosive trial in the middle of his father\u00b4s reelection campaign and likely prison time.\n\nBut it all fell apart.\n\nNow, Hunter Biden is headed to trial on federal gun charges in a case brought by his father\u00b4s Justice Department at a time when America's political and legal worlds are colliding like never before. Dogged for years by investigations, scrutinized over his troubled personal life and vilified by Republicans, the younger Biden is now also confronting the threat of felony convictions and time behind bars.\n\nThe case opening Monday with jury selection in Delaware is not about Hunter Biden's business dealings, which have been the focus of the yearslong federal investigation and Republicans' fruitless impeachment inquiry into the Democratic president. It's about a gun Hunter Biden had for about 11 days - a .38-caliber Colt Cobra Special. Prosecutors say he bought it illegally in October 2018 because he falsely swore on a federal form that he was not a drug user. He never fired the gun, according to his lawyers, and it ended up dumped in a trash can.\n\nThe trial will lack details about his foreign business matters that Republicans have seized on to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt, but it is expected to feature deeply personal and embarrassing testimony about dark time in the younger Biden's life. And it probably will provide new political impetus for Donald Trump's allies, who are eager to distract from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's own legal problems after he was convicted of 34 felony counts in his hush money trial.\n\nAllies of Joe Biden are worried about the toll the trial may take on the president, who already is concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as that son's darkest moments are relived in public. They also are worried that the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign while facing anemic poll numbers and is scheduled to prepare in Wilmington for a June 27 debate with Trump as the trial plays out nearby.\n\nHunter Biden arrives for a court appearance, Friday, May 24, 2024, in Wilmington, Del. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nIt once looked like Hunter Biden was going to avoid prosecution in the gun case altogether.\n\nThe deal was announced last June. Nearly three years earlier, Hunter Biden had confirmed the federal investigation into his tax affairs in December 2020, shortly after his father was elected.\n\nThe younger Biden would have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses; prosecutors would have recommended two years of probation. There was also a \"diversion agreement\" that would have allowed him to escape prosecution on a felony gun charge as long he stayed out of trouble for two years.\n\nBut the plea hearing quickly unraveled.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, quizzed both sides with concerns about the deal. To her, it seemed unusual and required her to be involved in the case in a way most federal judges are not. The lawyers huddled, trying to salvage the deal. At one point they could be heard yelling at each other.\n\n\"Well, we\u00b4ll just rip it up!\" Chris Clark, Biden's then-attorney, shouted as tempers flared.\n\n\"So what do we do now?\" the judge later asked the lawyers.\n\n\"Then there is no deal,\" prosecutor Leo Wise told her.\n\nA few weeks later, Attorney General Merrick Garland named David Weiss, the Trump-nominated U.S. attorney in Delaware who was leading the investigation, as a special counsel.\n\nHunter Biden was indicted a month after that on three gun counts. They are punishable by up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.\n\nThe bitterness between prosecutors and Hunter Biden's legal team is glaring. It's likely to be on display Monday.\n\nClark withdrew from the case, saying he might be called to testify in a potential legal dispute over the now-defunct deal. Another defense lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has accused Weiss of caving to political pressure to indict the president's son after Trump and other Republicans blasted the \"sweetheart deal.\" The defense has noted that charges related to gun possession by drug users are rare when not in connection with a more serious crime.\n\n\"Mr. Biden is not being prosecuted for any sin that DOJ (the Department of Justice) believes he has committed. He is being punished for the perceived sins of his father - the sin of opposing Mr. Trump\u00b4s election to the president,\" according to court papers filed by Lowell, who also has represented Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the former president's daughter and son-in-law.\n\nProsecutors say Lowell's contention is \"fiction designed for a Hollywood script.\"\n\n\"Contrary to his assertion, he has not established that the Special Counsel, appointed by and serving at the pleasure of President Biden and his Attorney General, is punishing the defendant 'for the perceived sins of his father\u00b4 in order to capitulate to a former President because of his tweets,\" Weiss' team responded.\n\nWeiss has said \"political considerations\" played no part in the investigation. He told lawmakers behind closed doors last year that that no one at the Justice Department prevented him from pursuing charges or taking other necessary steps, disputing claims from two IRS whistleblowers that the department improperly interfered in the tax investigation.\n\nThe case stems from a period where, by his own admission, Hunter Biden was addicted to crack.\n\nIn his memoir \"Beautiful Things,\" he described becoming consumed by drugs and alcohol after his older brother, Beau, died in 2015 at age 46 from brain cancer. The brothers were very close, having survived a car crash when they were young that killed their mother and baby sister.\n\nHunter Biden has said he has been sober since 2019. But prosecutors intend to use his memoir to make the case that he knew he was addicted to drugs when he denied it on the form that every person must fill out when buying a gun. They plan to show jurors text messages, videos and photos of Hunter Biden smoking crack, as well details about cocaine residue that authorities say was found on the pouch he used to hold his gun.\n\n\"I\u00b4m a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I\u00b4m delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I\u00b4ve ruined every relationship I\u00b4ve ever cherished,\" Hunter Biden wrote in one text message weeks after he bought the firearm, according to prosecutors.\n\nJurors are expected to hear testimony from his ex-wife and other former romantic partners, including Beau's widow, Hallie Biden, with whom Hunter Biden had a relationship after his brother's death. Hallie Biden found the gun in Hunter Biden's truck and threw it in a trash. It was found by a man collecting recyclables who gave it to the police.\n\nThe defense has suggested it will attack the credibility of the gun shop employees, noting there were changes to the gun-purchase form after the sale. Prosecutors say there were minor additions unrelated to the parts Hunter Biden filled out. His lawyers have suggested they may argue that Hunter Biden did not see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form.\n\n\"The terms 'user\u00b4 or 'addict\u00b4 are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" the defense wrote in a recent filing. \"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nThe case is expected to last a couple of weeks. He also is scheduled to stand trial in September in California in the case where he is accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over four years.\n\n_____\n\nAssociated Press writer Colleen in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nHunter Biden, President Joe Biden's son, right, walks with his wife Melissa Cohen Biden, to board Air Force One at Dover Air Force Base, Del., Friday, May 31, 2024.

He has pleaded not guilty. It is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California.\n\nThe trial in Wilmington, with U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika presiding, begins with the jury selection process.\n\nTrump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York on Thursday of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House. Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.\n\nHunter Biden was charged last September in the case brought by U.S. Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018. Weiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday in the sunny beach town. The president, who had been expected to depart Rehoboth Beach on Monday, traveled on Sunday evening to his home in Wilmington.\n\nPotential jurors will be screened for their ability to commit to serving the length of the trial, which is expected to run through the end of next week. All 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nThe case is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nProsecution lawyers revealed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter Biden's phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers. They said they may call as a witness his former wife Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they may try to show he had completed a drug rehabilitation program before purchasing the gun and may have considered his answer on the gun purchase form to be truthful.\n\nA plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Biden. Hunter Biden's lawyers blamed Republican pressure for the failure of the plea agreement.\n\nCongressional Republicans spent years in vain trying to find evidence of a corrupt link between Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, including work for Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and his father's political power.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; additional reporting by

At 8:30 a.m., he's due in the fourth-floor courtroom of U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika for the start of jury selection.\n\nFor the younger Biden and his family, the proceeding comes with substantial legal and political peril. Hunter Biden, 54, pleaded not guilty last year to charges he lied on a federal form about his drug use when he purchased the revolver in 2018, at a time when he has acknowledged being addicted to crack cocaine. If convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years behind bars, although any prison term is likely to amount to just a fraction of that maximum sentence.\n\nBut the proceeding itself is expected to delve into details of his addiction and thrust the Biden family's inner dynamics into public view as the president campaigns for re-election. The trial is expected to wrap up just weeks before Biden has his first debate with former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nThe sitting president's son will be defending himself against the Justice Department of his own father's administration, just days after Trump was convicted on 34 charges related to paying hush money to a porn star.\n\nUnlike in that trial, where leading Republicans rallied around the former president and showed up to support him in court, Democrats aren't expected to emerge as a major force defending Hunter Biden in the public arena. The White House views the trial as a personal matter and has no formal plans to respond to courtroom developments, according to a person familiar with the strategy.\n\n\"We support rule of law taking place without political hectoring,\" said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.), the top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.\n\nEfforts to put together a legal-defense fund for Hunter Biden have gained little traction, said David Jolly, the onetime Republican congressman who has been involved in efforts to shore up public support for Hunter Biden. He said he presented a memo outlining options for a fund to some Biden allies months ago and said his ideas remained on the drawing board.\n\nHunter Biden accompanied his father to the president's Rehoboth Beach vacation home in Delaware over the weekend. The two rode bikes together Saturday morning and attended church in the afternoon.\n\nThe president's son once thought he had headed off a trial. Last summer, he reached an agreement with federal prosecutors to plead guilty to a pair of misdemeanor tax charges and avoid prosecution on a gun charge.\n\nThe plea deal carried the promise of resolving a five-year investigation and avoiding a trial that would air tawdry details of a troubled period in which he has acknowledged struggles with drugs and alcohol. But the deal disintegrated during a dramatic July hearing in which the younger Biden's lawyers and federal prosecutors disagreed in open court about the extent of the immunity the agreement granted the president's son from possible future charges.\n\nWithin weeks of the hearing, Attorney General Merrick Garland conferred special counsel status on the federal prosecutor overseeing the investigation, David Weiss, an appointment that formally gave him added autonomy within the Justice Department.\n\nBy the end of the year, Biden was indicted on the gun charges in Delaware and, later, on tax charges in Los Angeles. His trial on tax charges, initially set to begin later in June, was recently delayed to early September.\n\nIn the gun case, federal prosecutors are planning to use the younger Biden's own words against him. They are expected to draw from excerpts of Biden's memoir published in 2021, \"Beautiful Things.\" Among the excerpts is a section of the book about his return to Delaware in October 2018.\n\n\"All my energy revolved around smoking drugs and making arrangements to buy drugs -- feeding the beast,\" Hunter Biden wrote in one excerpt that prosecutors referenced in court filings.\n\nIn court papers ahead of trial, federal prosecutors have also previewed a witness list that includes Hunter Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, and Hallie Biden, the widow of his late brother, Beau Biden. Prosecutors didn't reference either woman by name, but both are identifiable by the descriptions of their respective relationships to Hunter Biden, who had a romantic relationship with Hallie Biden following his brother's death.\n\nProsecutors said Buhle checked Hunter Biden's car periodically because she didn't want their children in a vehicle with drugs. On about a dozen occasions, prosecutors said, she found drugs or paraphernalia, which she discarded in a trash can. In a March 2018 text message, she wrote: \"I also found a few crack pipes. I took them out because our daughter was driving the car.\"\n\nProsecutors also plan to show videos and photographs of Biden smoking crack that were backed up to his Apple iCloud account and the now-infamous laptop he left at a Delaware computer store.\n\nIn court hearings ahead of trial, prosecutors have described the case as simple and straightforward.\n\nBiden's attorneys have dug in for a vigorous defense. His lead lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has questioned the legality of the gun sale and alleged that the store improperly accepted Biden's passport as identification.\n\nNoreika, a Trump appointee confirmed in 2018, said up to 250 residents of Delaware would be summoned to impanel a 12-member jury with four alternates in reserve. When a prosecutor asked if she would hold trial proceedings on Fridays, she replied, \"We're a five-day-a-week kind of court.\"", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

First lady Jill Biden arrived shortly after him.\n\nPresident Biden is not at the hearing; he's scheduled to attend a fundraiser in Connecticut Monday evening. But he did issue a statement, declining to weigh in on the trial but offering a statement of support for his son.\n\n\"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" his statement read. \"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean.\"\n\nThe president's son was indicted by a federal grand jury in September after a diversion agreement for a felony gun offense and a plea deal related to misdemeanor tax charges unraveled when U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned whether the agreement would allow him to avoid potential future charges.\n\nLate Sunday night, Norieka declined to allow Hunter Biden's lawyers to admit into evidence a second version of the firearms purchase form he filled out to buy the gun. His attorney, Abbe Lowell, claimed new information had been added to that second version after the criminal investigation had begun, including information about the types of identification Hunter Biden had presented. Norieka noted in her order that on both forms, \"no\" was checked next to the question about whether the applicant was an \"unlawful user or addict.\"\n\nIn a separate order the same day, Norieka also granted the government's motion to exclude one of the defense's expert witnesses, Dr. Elie Aoun, who was to testify on the nature of Hunter Biden's drug abuse and whether he understood himself to be an addict. She has reserved her opinion on whether to allow the testimony of another expert witness, Michael Lee Coyer.\n\nThe defense struck a potential juror early Monday after the prospective juror, a former Wilmington police officer who said he is a Fox News viewer, said he is an acquaintance of Jill Biden's, having worked with her at the college. He also said he has met Mr. Biden at multiple events, and donated to a challenger to Beau Biden, who served as the Attorney General of Delaware. The potential juror also told the judge that he believes prosecutors file cases for political reasons, mentioning the criminal case against former President Donald Trump in New York, and when asked if \"political prosecutions\" ever target Democrats, he answered no.\n\nOther potential jurors also answered \"yes\" when the judge asked \"are some dept of justice and law enforcement probes politically motivated?\" A series of them cited Trump's New York case.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys have decried the charges and argued they were \"unconstitutional\" and \"unprecedented,\" as well as in violation of the diversion agreement they maintain was still legally binding and valid.\n\nA flurry of motions to dismiss filed by Hunter Biden's attorneys were denied by Judge Noreika, and a federal appeals court rejected his motion to dismiss the gun charges in May.\n\nIn the three-count indictment, the president's son is charged with making false statements on a federal gun form about his drug use, certifying he was not a user of or addicted to any controlled substance during a period when prosecutors allege he was addicted to crack cocaine. Biden purchased a Colt Cobra .38 Special revolver, and it remained in his possession for 11 days before it was discarded in an outdoor receptacle by Hallie Biden, Hunter Biden's romantic partner at the time.\n\nProsecutors are expected to introduce evidence that details Hunter Biden's use of controlled substances leading up to and during the period he purchased the firearm. In their trial brief, they reference his own admission of drug addiction in excerpts from his memoir, Beautiful Things, as well as photos and videos from his laptop and text messages.\n\nProsecutors also intend to include testimony from Hunter Biden's former romantic partners recounting his substance abuse, including his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle and Hallie Biden, the widow of his late brother, Beau Biden, and expert testimony from FBI and DEA agents.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys seek to call their own expert witnesses on addiction and forensic psychiatry and forensic toxicology.\n\nThe charges were brought by special counsel David Weiss who was appointed U.S. attorney for Delaware by former President Donald Trump and named special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2023. Federal probes into Hunter Biden, led by Weiss, spanned five years over the course of both the Trump and Biden administrations.\n\nAttorneys for Hunter Biden asserted that Weiss \"buckled under political pressure to bring more severe charges\" after the plea agreement elicited a \"sharp rebuke\" from former President Trump and his Republican allies when it was first made public. Weiss' office slammed claims that the charges were fueled by politics and were pursued to appease Republicans.\n\n\"The charges in this case are not trumped up or because of former President Trump -- they are instead a result of the defendant's own choices and were brought in spite of, not because of, any outside noise made by politicians,\" prosecutors said.\n\nHunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison and $750,000 in fines if convicted on all counts.\n\nSeparately, he faces nine federal tax charges in the central district of California in a second indictment brought by Weiss' office where federal prosecutors allege President Biden's son engaged in a \"four-year scheme\" to avoid paying at least $1.4 million in federal taxes.\n\nHunter Biden is charged with three felony and six misdemeanor charges related to his alleged failure to file and pay taxes, evasion of assessment, and filing a false or fraudulent tax return. Biden has pleaded not guilty to those charges.\n\nHis motions to dismiss the federal tax charges were all denied by U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi in April. If convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 17 years in prison.\n\nReferences to the tax charges or questioning related to those charges or the plea hearing are not admissible in his federal gun trial in

The son of a sitting president has never before faced a criminal trial.\n\nMORE: As Hunter Biden goes to trial on gun charges, here's how his attorneys plan to defend a 'simple case'\n\nThe trial comes on the heels of former President Donald Trump's conviction on felony charges related to a 2016 hush money payment made to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nHunter Biden has arrived at the courthouse for the start of his federal gun trial this morning.\n\nHis mother, first lady Jill Biden, is also attending.\n\nTwo hundred and fifty Delaware residents have been summoned to the courthouse in downtown Wilmington, where they will face typical questions about their fitness to serve as jurors.\n\nBut because this is the trial of the son of a sitting president, there will be some novel topics covered during the jury selection process known as \"voir dire.\"\n\nAmong the questions jurors will be asked: \"If you were eligible to vote in any election(s) in which Joseph R. Biden was a candidate, would that fact prevent you from maintaining an open, impartial mind until all of the evidence is presented, and the instructions of the Court are given?\"\n\nAnd \"Do you believe Robert Hunter Biden is being prosecuted in this case because his father is the President of the United States and a candidate for President?\"\n\nOn the eve of trial, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika threw a wrench in one of the key arguments attorneys for Hunter Biden were planning to advance, ruling that an annotated copy of the federal form Hunter Biden is accused of lying on would be excluded from evidence.\n\nThe original document, called an ATF Form 4473, was created in 2018 when Hunter Biden purchased the firearm. But in 2021, gun store employees made a copy that included some handwritten notes. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell contended that employees had \"tampered with\" the document, and that it raised questions about \"who wrote what on the form, and when.\"\n\nLowell hoped his argument would undermine the credibility of some key government witnesses -- the people who sold Biden the gun -- and potentially create a reasonable doubt that Hunter Biden was the one who actually checked that box.\n\nAttorneys for special counsel David Weiss' office have said the gun shop employees merely \"annotated\" the form and urged Noreika to prevent Lowell from introducing it into evidence.\n\nJury selection is scheduled to get underway today in the federal gun trial of Hunter Biden, who authorities say broke the law when he purchased a Colt revolver in 2018.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's son faces two counts of making false statements while purchasing the firearm and a third count of illegally obtaining it while addicted to drugs.\n\nAlthough the charges together carry a possible sentence of up to 25 years, legal experts say that, as a first-time and nonviolent offender, Hunter Biden would not likely serve time if convicted.\n\nThe trial, in Delaware federal court, is expected to last two to three weeks.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden",

He has pleaded not guilty. It is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California.\n\nThe trial in Wilmington, with U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika presiding, begins with the jury selection process.\n\nTrump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York on Thursday of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House. Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.\n\nHunter Biden was charged last September in the case brought by U.S. Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018. Weiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday in the sunny beach town. The president, who had been expected to depart Rehoboth Beach on Monday, traveled on Sunday evening to his home in Wilmington.\n\nPotential jurors will be screened for their ability to commit to serving the length of the trial, which is expected to run through the end of next week. All 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nThe case is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nProsecution lawyers revealed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter Biden's phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers. They said they may call as a witness his former wife Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they may try to show he had completed a drug rehabilitation program before purchasing the gun and may have considered his answer on the gun purchase form to be truthful.\n\nA plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Biden. Hunter Biden's lawyers blamed Republican pressure for the failure of the plea agreement.\n\nCongressional Republicans spent years in vain trying to find evidence of a corrupt link between Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, including work for Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and his father's political power.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; additional reporting by Stephanie Kelly in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware; editing by Amy Stevens, Will Dunham and Michael Perry)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Jury selection got underway, with the trial expected to last one to two weeks.\n\nPresident Biden said he and the first lady, who was marking her 73rd birthday Monday, were \"so proud\" of Hunter Biden.\n\n\"As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nThe trial comes days after a jury in New York made history by finding Donald Trump guilty of business fraud, the first time a former president has ever been criminally convicted.\n\nTrump, who is running as the Republican challenger to Joe Biden in November, faces three other far more serious criminal cases, including his alleged attempt to overthrow the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe Delaware trial -- along with another in which Hunter Biden faces charges in California on tax evasion -- is an embarrassment for Joe Biden, as he seeks a second term and hopes to keep the country's focus on Trump's behavior.\n\nIn addition to being a political distraction, Hunter Biden's legal woes will reopen painful emotional wounds for the family from his lengthy period as a serious drug addict -- a period that both he and his father have discussed publicly. Hunter Biden's brother Beau died from cancer in 2015 and his sister Naomi died as an infant in a 1972 car crash.\n\nThe Yale-trained lawyer and lobbyist-turned-artist is charged with falsely stating on legal paperwork when buying a .38 caliber Colt Cobra revolver in 2018 that he was not using drugs illegally. He is also charged with illegal possession of the firearm, which he had for just 11 days in October of that year.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty. He had earlier reached a plea deal with prosecutors but this collapsed, leading to the trial.\n\nProsecutors are set to introduce voluminous -- and often uncomfortable -- evidence linked to Hunter Biden's years as an addict.\n\nThey have called as witnesses three of his former partners, including Lunden Roberts, the mother of one of his children.\n\nThe president's son, who has written unsparingly about his addiction, will contend that at the moment he bought the revolver, he did not consider himself to be an addict. He has stated that he has been sober since 2019.\n\nIf found guilty, Hunter Biden could face 25 years in prison, although as a first-time offender he could get a far lighter sentence or escape any jail time.\n\nPresident Biden on Monday said that his son's difficulties would resonate widely.\n\n\"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\" he said.\n\nHunter Biden has long been the target of Trump and hard-right Republicans, amplified by exhaustive coverage on Fox News.\n\nLurid photos from his time as an addict have been leaked, and Trump allies have investigated him at length in Congress on allegations of corruption and influence-peddling. However, no charges have ever been brought.\n\nHunter Biden's messy private life and controversial foreign business dealings in China and Ukraine have also formed the basis for attempts by Republicans in Congress to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Biden. Those efforts too have gone nowhere.\n\nThe White House said last year that there would be no presidential pardon for Hunter Biden in case of a conviction.\n\nDemocratic congressman Adam Schiff, a Biden ally, told CNN Sunday that Americans should \"absolutely\" respect the jury's verdict.\n\n\"I think the president himself will respect the verdict -- much as it is painful, I'm sure, to see one of your children on trial.\"", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times AU"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(AP) -- Jury selection is to begin Monday in a federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election.\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his father, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_kunzelman@thestar.com", "name": "Michael Kunzelman", "type":

The indictment was brought by the Justice Department, specifically by David Weiss, the special counsel appointed last year to oversee the Hunter Biden probes.\n\nHunter Biden, 54, is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He pleaded not guilty to the three charges, though he has been open about his struggles with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction.\n\nThe trial could last one to two weeks and is taking place in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nThe first two charges in the three-count indictment are tied to the gun purchase itself.\n\nWhen a person buys a gun, they must fill out a form with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and affirm that they are legally allowed to buy the weapon. Hunter Biden has been charged with lying on those forms.\n\nThese questions include: Have you been convicted of a felony? Are you a fugitive? Are you in the country unlawfully? And, importantly for this case, are you an \"unlawful user of, or addicted to\" illegal drugs? Hunter Biden allegedly checked the box that said, \"No.\"\n\nCount 3 relates to the possession of the gun. It's also against federal law to possess a gun if you are abusing drugs. Hunter Biden had the gun for 11 days in October 2018, before his girlfriend threw it in a dumpster because she was worried about his mental health, according to the indictment and texts made public in recent court filings.\n\n\"Guns present a danger if they get in the wrong hands, and that's the impetus behind these laws,\" Nabeel Kibria, a Washington, DC-based defense attorney who has handled hundreds of gun cases, told CNN. \"The evidence seems pretty stacked against Hunter ... but who determines who is an addict? What are the bright-line rules that must be followed?\"\n\nProsecutors have said they plan to call about a dozen witnesses for their case.\n\nMost notably, they've lined up testimony from three of Hunter Biden's former romantic partners to testify about his drug use around the time he bought the gun. This includes his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle; his late brother's widow, Hallie Biden, whom Hunter Biden later dated; and Lunden Roberts, the mother of one of his children.\n\nTheir testimony could bring to life a period that Hunter Biden has described as his rock bottom, during which he was almost always on drugs or trying to get drugs. At his attempted plea hearing last year, Hunter Biden testified that he has been sober since May 2019.\n\n\"He's going to experience stress and shame at the trial,\" said Valerie Earnshaw, a social psychology professor at the University of Delaware who researches the stigmas surrounding addiction. \"It depends on his own recovery journey, but there could be days where he experiences a lot of shame. It's a toxic emotion that eats you up. It does not motivate healthy behaviors.\"\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers wanted to call an expert who could tell the jury about how people with addictions understand their own struggles. But in a ruling Sunday, the judge blocked the defense attorneys from using that witness because of procedural defects with their disclosures to prosecutors about what the expert might say.\n\nHis team also has a forensic chemist who could testify about a white residue on his gun pouch that prosecutors say testified positive for cocaine when it was analyzed by the FBI in 2023.\n\nThe case was initiated by Weiss, the former Donald Trump-appointed US attorney in Delaware. Attorney General Merrick Garland elevated Weiss to special counsel status last year, after a proposed plea deal with Hunter Biden blew up in spectacular fashion.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers claimed Weiss only sought the indictment because he caved to a relentless pressure campaign from Republican lawmakers and the former president. Weiss panned this theory as a \"fiction designed for a Hollywood script,\" and the judge overseeing the gun case concluded the allegations were \"nonsensical under the facts here.\"\n\nBut many Republicans have criticized Weiss, claiming he offered Hunter Biden a \"sweetheart deal\" last year that would have resolved the gun matter and ended a tax probe with a misdemeanor-only plea. (Legal experts told CNN at the time that the proposed deal was reasonable.)\n\nDistrict Judge Maryellen Noreika is presiding over the case. A former patent lawyer, she had the support of Delaware's two Democratic senators when she was appointed by Trump. The Senate confirmed her nomination with a unanimous voice vote in 2018.\n\nShe oversaw last summer's dramatic hearing during which both sides asked her to approve a plea deal. But she balked and uncovered through tough questioning that there were grave differences between the parties about the scope of the deal. That hearing ended without a resolution, and the plea discussions later collapsed. That's when Garland named Weiss as special counsel.\n\nNoreika's no-nonsense approach has kept the proceedings moving in a steady fashion. She rejected Hunter Biden's attempts to toss the case or derail the prosecution but has sided with him on several key evidentiary questions.\n\nIf convicted on all three counts, the president's son could face up to 25 years in prison.\n\nHowever, he doesn't have a prior criminal record, and first-time offenders often get much lower sentences than the maximum. His punishment would be solely up to Noreika.\n\nThese are federal charges, so Joe Biden has the power to pardon his son at any time. If his son is convicted, the president could also commute the sentence, sparing him from the levied punishment.\n\nThe White House has explicitly ruled out the possibility of a pardon, but that political calculus could change after the November election.\n\nThis is a historic moment for the United States and the history of the presidency. No president has ever tried to run the country while watching his own child go on trial.\n\nOver the decades, there are plenty of examples of presidential family members getting in trouble. George H. W. Bush's son faced civil penalties for violating banking laws while his father was serving in the White House. Jimmy Carter's brother was scrutinized for his foreign lobbying. But nothing has sunk to the level of a criminal trial.\n\nCNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said that \"there's always somebody considered a black sheep in the presidential family\" but that Hunter Biden's sprawling legal issues \"cut unusually close to the bone because it's the president's son.\"\n\nRELATED: Hunter Biden threatens to sue Fox News for airing 'revenge porn'\n\n\"This trial is an albatross around President Biden's neck and weighs very heavily on his psyche,\" Brinkley said. \"For any parent to watch their child go through addiction, and now face possible jail time, it's harrowing. You would hope that family would be his comfort zone. But in this case, family is probably his biggest worry of the moment.\"\n\nThe family ties have also led to some intriguing divergences between father and son.\n\nThere is a separate court battle over the constitutionality of the law that makes it illegal for drug users to own a gun. The Biden administration is defending the law and wants the Supreme Court to take up the matter. But Hunter Biden's team argued in his case - unsuccessfully - that the law violates the Second Amendment.\n\nApproximately 250 Delaware residents have been summoned for jury service, according to the judge. They'll be whittled down to a panel of 12 seated jurors and four alternates.\n\nDelaware is one of the smallest states in the country, and the Biden family looms large.\n\nAs part of the selection process - called voir dire - prospective jurors will be asked whether they can stay impartial regardless of their views about the 2024 election. They'll also be asked whether they can keep an open mind about Hunter Biden and even whether they've been eligible to vote in past elections for Joe Biden, who has held public office in Delaware since 1971.\n\nOther questions touch on the highly politicized atmosphere surrounding the case, including, \"Do you believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted in this case because his father is the President of the United States?\" or, coming from the other side, whether they think he \"is not being prosecuted for other crimes because his father is the President.\"\n\nSince his indictments last year, Hunter Biden hasn't said much about his legal cases.\n\nHe spoke out in December amid his fight with the House Republicans who are probing his business dealings and took responsibility for having \"made mistakes in my life and wasted opportunities and privileges that I was afforded.\" But he slammed the \"MAGA right\" lawmakers who \"ridiculed my struggle with addiction\" and \"belittled my recovery.\"\n\n\"They have tried to dehumanize me, all to embarrass and damage my father,\" he said.\n\nPreviously, Hunter Biden shared intensely personal details about his addiction in his 2021 memoir, which prosecutors plan to use against him at trial. He described his stints in rehab, his relapses, how he bought drugs near the White House, and the stretches of time when he \"had no plan beyond the moment-to-moment demands of the crack pipe.\"\n\nOne of the most notable pieces of evidence in the case will be messages from Hunter Biden's infamous laptop, which has been at the center of a yearslong political saga. Weiss said the material \"is real\" and will be an important part of his case, rebutting past claims from the president's son that the laptop might be fake or even Russian disinformation.\n\nRepublican officials and right-wing outlets have seized on the laptop's embarrassing emails and sexually explicit images to attack Hunter Biden, while his lawyers say the files were manipulated and sued a repair-shop owner who helped make the materials public.\n\nMany on the right celebrated this move by Weiss, even if he hasn't verified their loftier anti-Biden allegations. The New York Post, the conservative tabloid that was first to publish messages from the laptop in 2020, recently took a victory lap on its front cover.\n\nRELATED: Hunter Biden laptop to be introduced as evidence at gun trial, special counsel Weiss says in filing\n\nIn a ruling last month, Noreika said she'll let Hunter Biden challenge the authenticity of any messages introduced at trial. Some of the texts contain gut-wrenching arguments between Hunter Biden and his loved ones about his sobriety. Others show him meeting up with drug dealers, including some just a few blocks from the Wilmington federal courthouse.\n\n\"I'm a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I've ruined every relationship I've ever cherished,\" he texted Hallie Biden in October 2018, according to Weiss' filings.\n\nProsecutors plan to use the laptop to specifically support their claim that he was using illegal drugs when he bought the gun in 2018. Weiss has not addressed - and the case is not about - Republicans' unproven allegation that emails from the laptop prove that Hunter Biden and his father were involved in corrupt foreign business deals.\n\nThis is just one of two trials Hunter Biden faces this year.\n\nThe second case is scheduled for September in Los Angeles and revolves around Hunter Biden's troubled finances. He has pleaded not guilty to tax evasion, filing false tax returns and failing to file his taxes on time.\n\nOriginally, the trials were both scheduled for June, but Hunter Biden got a reprieve from the California federal judge, who agreed to postpone that trial.

The indictment was brought by the Justice Department, specifically by David Weiss, the special counsel appointed last year to oversee the Hunter Biden probes.\n\nHunter Biden, 54, is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He pleaded not guilty to the three charges, though he has been open about his struggles with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction.\n\nThe trial could last one to two weeks and is taking place in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWhen a person buys a gun, they must fill out a form with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and affirm that they are legally allowed to buy the weapon. Hunter Biden has been charged with lying on those forms.\n\nThese questions include: Have you been convicted of a felony? Are you a fugitive? Are you in the country unlawfully? And, importantly for this case, are you an \"unlawful user of, or addicted to\" illegal drugs? Hunter Biden allegedly checked the box that said, \"No.\"\n\nCount 3 relates to the possession of the gun. It's also against federal law to possess a gun if you are abusing drugs. Hunter Biden had the gun for 11 days in October 2018, before his girlfriend threw it in a dumpster because she was worried about his mental health, according to the indictment and texts made public in recent court filings.\n\n\"Guns present a danger if they get in the wrong hands, and that's the impetus behind these laws,\" Nabeel Kibria, a Washington, DC-based defense attorney who has handled hundreds of gun cases, told CNN. \"The evidence seems pretty stacked against Hunter ... but who determines who is an addict? What are the bright-line rules that must be followed?\"\n\nWho are the witnesses?\n\nProsecutors have said they plan to call about a dozen witnesses for their case.\n\nMost notably, they've lined up testimony from three of Hunter Biden's former romantic partners to testify about his drug use around the time he bought the gun. This includes his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle; his late brother's widow, Hallie Biden, whom Hunter Biden later dated; and Lunden Roberts, the mother of one of his children.\n\nTheir testimony could bring to life a period that Hunter Biden has described as his rock bottom, during which he was almost always on drugs or trying to get drugs. At his attempted plea hearing last year, Hunter Biden testified that he has been sober since May 2019.\n\n\"He's going to experience stress and shame at the trial,\" said Valerie Earnshaw, a social psychology professor at the University of Delaware who researches the stigmas surrounding addiction. \"It depends on his own recovery journey, but there could be days where he experiences a lot of shame. It's a toxic emotion that eats you up. It does not motivate healthy behaviors.\"\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers said they might call an expert who can tell the jury about how people with addictions understand their own struggles. His team also has a forensic chemist who could testify about a white residue on his gun pouch that prosecutors say testified positive for cocaine when it was analyzed by the FBI in 2023.\n\nWho are the prosecutors?\n\nThe case was initiated by Weiss, the former Donald Trump-appointed US attorney in Delaware. Attorney General Merrick Garland elevated Weiss to special counsel status last year, after a proposed plea deal with Hunter Biden blew up in spectacular fashion.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers claimed Weiss only sought the indictment because he caved to a relentless pressure campaign from Republican lawmakers and the former president. Weiss panned this theory as a \"fiction designed for a Hollywood script,\" and the judge overseeing the gun case concluded the allegations were \"nonsensical under the facts here.\"\n\nBut many Republicans have criticized Weiss, claiming he offered Hunter Biden a \"sweetheart deal\" last year that would have resolved the gun matter and ended a tax probe with a misdemeanor-only plea. (Legal experts told CNN at the time that the proposed deal was reasonable.)\n\nWho is the judge?\n\nDistrict Judge Maryellen Noreika is presiding over the case. A former patent lawyer, she had the support of Delaware's two Democratic senators when she was appointed by Trump. The Senate confirmed her nomination with a unanimous voice vote in 2018.\n\nShe oversaw last summer's dramatic hearing during which both sides asked her to approve a plea deal. But she balked and uncovered through tough questioning that there were grave differences between the parties about the scope of the deal. That hearing ended without a resolution, and the plea discussions later collapsed. That's when Garland named Weiss as special counsel.\n\nNoreika's no-nonsense approach has kept the proceedings moving in a steady fashion. She rejected Hunter Biden's attempts to toss the case or derail the prosecution but has sided with him on several key evidentiary questions.\n\nCould Hunter Biden go to prison?\n\nIf convicted on all three counts, the president's son could face up to 25 years in prison.\n\nHowever, he doesn't have a prior criminal record, and first-time offenders often get much lower sentences than the maximum. His punishment would be solely up to Noreika.\n\nThese are federal charges, so Joe Biden has the power to pardon his son at any time. If his son is convicted, the president could also commute the sentence, sparing him from the levied punishment.\n\nThe White House has explicitly ruled out the possibility of a pardon, but that political calculus could change after the November election.\n\nHas this ever happened before?\n\nThis is a historic moment for the United States and the history of the presidency. No president has ever tried to run the country while watching his own child go on trial.\n\nOver the decades, there are plenty of examples of presidential family members getting in trouble. George H. W. Bush's son faced civil penalties for violating banking laws while his father was serving in the White House. Jimmy Carter's brother was scrutinized for his foreign lobbying. But nothing has sunk to the level of a criminal trial.\n\nCNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said that \"there's always somebody considered a black sheep in the presidential family\" but that Hunter Biden's sprawling legal issues \"cut unusually close to the bone because it's the president's son.\"\n\n\"This trial is an albatross around President Biden's neck and weighs very heavily on his psyche,\" Brinkley said. \"For any parent to watch their child go through addiction, and now face possible jail time, it's harrowing. You would hope that family would be his comfort zone. But in this case, family is probably his biggest worry of the moment.\"\n\nThe family ties have also led to some intriguing divergences between father and son.\n\nThere is a separate court battle over the constitutionality of the law that makes it illegal for drug users to own a gun. The Biden administration is defending the law and wants the Supreme Court to take up the matter. But Hunter Biden's team argued in his case - unsuccessfully - that the law violates the Second Amendment.\n\nThe jury pool\n\nApproximately 250 Delaware residents have been summoned for jury service, according to the judge. They'll be whittled down to a panel of 12 seated jurors and four alternates.\n\nDelaware is one of the smallest states in the country, and the Biden family looms large.\n\nAs part of the selection process - called voir dire - prospective jurors will be asked whether they can stay impartial regardless of their views about the 2024 election. They'll also be asked whether they can keep an open mind about Hunter Biden and even whether they've been eligible to vote in past elections for Joe Biden, who has held public office in Delaware since 1971.\n\nOther questions touch on the highly politicized atmosphere surrounding the case, including, \"Do you believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted in this case because his father is the President of the United States?\" or, coming from the other side, whether they think he \"is not being prosecuted for other crimes because his father is the President.\"\n\nWhat has Hunter Biden said?\n\nSince his indictments last year, Hunter Biden hasn't said much about his legal cases.\n\nHe spoke out in December amid his fight with the House Republicans who are probing his business dealings and took responsibility for having \"made mistakes in my life and wasted opportunities and privileges that I was afforded.\" But he slammed the \"MAGA right\" lawmakers who \"ridiculed my struggle with addiction\" and \"belittled my recovery.\"\n\n\"They have tried to dehumanize me, all to embarrass and damage my father,\" he said.\n\nPreviously, Hunter Biden shared intensely personal details about his addiction in his 2021 memoir, which prosecutors plan to use against him at trial. He described his stints in rehab, his relapses, how he bought drugs near the White House, and the stretches of time when he \"had no plan beyond the moment-to-moment demands of the crack pipe.\"\n\nThe laptop, texts and emails\n\nOne of the most notable pieces of evidence in the case will be messages from Hunter Biden's infamous laptop, which has been at the center of a yearslong political saga. Weiss said the material \"is real\" and will be an important part of his case, rebutting past claims from the president's son that the laptop might be fake or even Russian disinformation.\n\nRepublican officials and right-wing outlets have seized on the laptop's embarrassing emails and sexually explicit images to attack Hunter Biden, while his lawyers say the files were manipulated and sued a repair-shop owner who helped make the materials public.\n\nMany on the right celebrated this move by Weiss, even if he hasn't verified their loftier anti-Biden allegations. The New York Post, the conservative tabloid that was first to publish messages from the laptop in 2020, recently took a victory lap on its front cover.\n\nIn a ruling last month, Noreika said she'll let Hunter Biden challenge the authenticity of any messages introduced at trial. Some of the texts contain gut-wrenching arguments between Hunter Biden and his loved ones about his sobriety. Others show him meeting up with drug dealers, including some just a few blocks from the Wilmington federal courthouse.\n\n\"I'm a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I've ruined every relationship I've ever cherished,\" he texted Hallie Biden in October 2018, according to Weiss' filings.\n\nProsecutors plan to use the laptop to specifically support their claim that he was using illegal drugs when he bought the gun in 2018. Weiss has not addressed - and the case is not about - Republicans' unproven allegation that emails from the laptop prove that Hunter Biden and his father were involved in corrupt foreign business deals.\n\nWhat about the tax charges?\n\nThis is just one of two trials Hunter Biden faces this year.\n\nThe second case is scheduled for September in Los Angeles and revolves around Hunter Biden's troubled finances. He has pleaded not guilty to tax evasion, filing false tax returns and failing to file his taxes on time.\n\nOriginally, the trials were both scheduled for June, but Hunter Biden got a reprieve from the California federal judge, who agreed to postpone that trial. But the September trial date means that case will coincide with the final stretch of the presidential campaign.\n\nCNN's Holmes Lybrand contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

(AP) -- Jury selection is to begin Monday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son after a deal with prosecutors fell apart that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election.\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his father, has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment.\n\nThe trial comes just four days after Donald Trump was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City after a jury found him guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are not related, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a years-long investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned some unusual aspects of the deal that included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a \"diversion agreement\" on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective; Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad, and attending church together.\n\nBiden, in a last minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding the helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show he was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun - and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence Hunter Biden's published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos where he's often nude and doing drugs and highly personal messages where he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period where, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother Beau Biden from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018, and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.\n\nMore from this section\n\nDocumentary Showcase Presents 'Liyana,' a Tale of Orphaned African Children Transforming Trauma Into Hope\n\nMy

Jury selection got underway, with the trial expected to last one to two weeks.\n\nPresident Biden said he and the first lady, who was marking her 73rd birthday Monday, were \"so proud\" of Hunter Biden.\n\n\"As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nThe trial comes days after a jury in New York made history by finding Donald Trump guilty of business fraud, the first time a former president has ever been criminally convicted.\n\nTrump, who is running as the Republican challenger to Joe Biden in November, faces three other far more serious criminal cases, including his alleged attempt to overthrow the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe Delaware trial -- along with another in which Hunter Biden faces charges in California on tax evasion -- is an embarrassment for Joe Biden, as he seeks a second term and hopes to keep the country's focus on Trump's behavior.\n\nIn addition to being a political distraction, Hunter Biden's legal woes will reopen painful emotional wounds for the family from his lengthy period as a serious drug addict -- a period that both he and his father have discussed publicly. Hunter Biden's brother Beau died from cancer in 2015 and his sister Naomi died as an infant in a 1972 car crash.\n\n- Addiction -\n\nThe Yale-trained lawyer and lobbyist-turned-artist is charged with falsely stating on legal paperwork when buying a .38 caliber Colt Cobra revolver in 2018 that he was not using drugs illegally. He is also charged with illegal possession of the firearm, which he had for just 11 days in October of that year.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty. He had earlier reached a plea deal with prosecutors but this collapsed, leading to the trial.\n\nProsecutors are set to introduce voluminous -- and often uncomfortable -- evidence linked to Hunter Biden's years as an addict.\n\nThey have called as witnesses three of his former partners, including Lunden Roberts, the mother of one of his children.\n\nThe president's son, who has written unsparingly about his addiction, will contend that at the moment he bought the revolver, he did not consider himself to be an addict. He has stated that he has been sober since 2019.\n\nIf found guilty, Hunter Biden could face 25 years in prison, although as a first-time offender he could get a far lighter sentence or escape any jail time.\n\nPresident Biden on Monday said that his son's difficulties would resonate widely.\n\n\"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\" he said.\n\n- Republican target -\n\nHunter Biden has long been the target of Trump and hard-right Republicans, amplified by exhaustive coverage on Fox News.\n\nLurid photos from his time as an addict have been leaked, and Trump allies have investigated him at length in Congress on allegations of corruption and influence-peddling. However, no charges have ever been brought.\n\nHunter Biden's messy private life and controversial foreign business dealings in China and Ukraine have also formed the basis for attempts by Republicans in Congress to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Biden. Those efforts too have gone nowhere.\n\nThe White House said last year that there would be no presidential pardon for Hunter Biden in case of a conviction.\n\nDemocratic congressman Adam Schiff, a Biden ally, told CNN Sunday that Americans should \"absolutely\" respect the jury's verdict.\n\n\"I think the president himself will respect the verdict -- much as it is painful, I'm sure, to see one of your children on trial.\"", "source": {"uri": "digitaljournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@digitaljournal.com", "name": "Agence

(AP) -- Jury selection is to begin Monday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son after a deal with prosecutors fell apart that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election.\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his father, has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment.\n\nThe trial comes just four days after Donald Trump was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City after a jury found him guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are not related, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a years-long investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned some unusual aspects of the deal that included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a \"diversion agreement\" on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective; Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad, and attending church together.\n\nBiden, in a last minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding the helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show he was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun -- and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence Hunter Biden's published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos where he's often nude and doing drugs and highly personal messages where he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period where, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother Beau Biden from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018, and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.\n\nOur 2024 Coverage Needs YouIt's Another Trump-Biden Showdown -- And We Need Your HelpThe Future Of Democracy Is At StakeOur 2024 Coverage Needs YouYour Loyalty Means The World To Us\n\nAs Americans head to the polls in 2024, the very future of our country is at stake.

But last July, a plea bargain fell apart.\n\nIf found guilty, Biden could face 25 years in prison, though in practice such offenses, if not accompanied by other charges, are seldom punished by incarceration.\n\n'Rehabilitation'\n\nJurors will hear about the defendant's drug use as prosecutors run through events that led to him buying the firearm in Delaware.\n\nThe defense team has pushed for narrow definitions of the terms \"addict\" and \"user,\" and requested instructions requiring an acquittal if the jury determines that the defendant did not consider himself to fit those definitions.\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" his lawyer Abbe Lowell wrote in court documents.\n\n\"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nAmong those reportedly expected to testify is the defendant's lover at the time of the firearm incident: Hallie Biden, the widow of Hunter's brother Beau Biden.\n\nThe case comes with Republicans pursuing an impeachment inquiry in Congress into what they claim is a Biden family criminal conspiracy, although they have provided no evidence.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have accused Hunter Biden of engaging in corrupt business practices in China and Ukraine, but he has not been charged with any crimes related to his foreign dealings.\n\nThe president has said he stands by his son and loves him for his attempts to recover from drug addiction.\n\nDemocratic congressman Adam Schiff, a Biden ally, told CNN Sunday that Americans should \"absolutely\" respect the jury's verdict, however it rules.\n\n\"And I think the president himself will respect the verdict -- much as it is painful, I'm sure, to see one of your children on trial.\"\n\nProsecutors have said they expect to take three days to present their case, and the untelevised trial will likely last about two weeks.\n\nHunter Biden faces separate tax evasion charges in California, in a case set for trial later this year.\n\nLast week Trump was convicted in a Manhattan court of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money paid to an adult film star.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors":

The two criminal cases are not related, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken centre stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay USD 1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a years-long investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned some unusual aspects of the deal that included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanour offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a \"diversion agreement\" on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinised. He's also protective; Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad, and attending church together.\n\nBiden, in a last minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding the helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show he was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun - and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence Hunter Biden's published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved.\n\nThe contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos where he's often nude and doing drugs and highly personal messages where he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period where, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother Beau Biden from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018, and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.

Prosecutors have indicated they could call at least two of Hunter Biden's exes to testify: his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle and Hallie Biden, the widow of Hunter Biden's brother, Beau, who Hunter Biden was dating at the time of the gun purchase. Hallie Biden allegedly found the gun in Hunter Biden's truck and discarded it, federal prosecutors alleged, citing text messages they obtained between the two.\n\nHunter Biden is facing two sets of charges: The gun-related charges, and a set of tax charges. The Internal Revenue Service began probing Hunter Biden's finances in 2018, and he publicly confirmed the investigation in 2020, just days before his father's inauguration. Hunter Biden's attorneys announced they had reached a plea deal with federal prosecutors last summer for him to plead guilty to two misdemeanor charges of failing to pay more than $100,000 in taxes in 2017 and 2018. Separately, the gun charge would have been wiped from his record if he adhered to the terms of the agreement, including completing a diversion program. The plea deal unraveled when prosecutors indicated the investigation against Hunter Biden was ongoing and he could potentially face other charges, and prosecutors subsequently charged him with tax crimes in Los Angeles and gun charges in Delaware.\n\nThe trial for the nine federal tax charges Hunter Biden faces is set to begin Sept. 5 in Los Angeles. He has pleaded not guilty to three felony and six misdemeanor counts, including failing to file and pay taxes and tax evasion. Prosecutors allege Hunter Biden failed to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes between 2016 and 2019 and instead spent the money on an \"extravagant lifestyle.\"\n\nHunter Biden has been at the center of Republican-led congressional investigations probing whether the president used his influence to aid his family's business dealings. Republicans have aired salacious details of Hunter Biden's personal life throughout the course of the years-long probes, presenting evidence collected from the infamous laptop he allegedly left at a Delaware computer store.

Jury selection got underway, with the trial expected to last one to two weeks.\n\nPresident Biden said he and the first lady, who was marking her 73rd birthday Monday, were \"so proud\" of Hunter Biden.\n\n\"As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nThe trial comes days after a jury in New York made history by finding Donald Trump guilty of business fraud, the first time a former president has ever been criminally convicted.\n\nTrump, who is running as the Republican challenger to Joe Biden in November, faces three other far more serious criminal cases, including his alleged attempt to overthrow the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe Delaware trial -- along with another in which Hunter Biden faces charges in California on tax evasion -- is an embarrassment for Joe Biden, as he seeks a second term and hopes to keep the country's focus on Trump's behavior.\n\nIn addition to being a political distraction, Hunter Biden's legal woes will reopen painful emotional wounds for the family from his lengthy period as a serious drug addict -- a period that both he and his father have discussed publicly. Hunter Biden's brother Beau died from cancer in 2015 and his sister Naomi died as an infant in a 1972 car crash.\n\n- Addiction -\n\nThe Yale-trained lawyer and lobbyist-turned-artist is charged with falsely stating on legal paperwork when buying a .38 caliber Colt Cobra revolver in 2018 that he was not using drugs illegally. He is also charged with illegal possession of the firearm, which he had for just 11 days in October of that year.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty. He had earlier reached a plea deal with prosecutors but this collapsed, leading to the trial.\n\nProsecutors are set to introduce voluminous -- and often uncomfortable -- evidence linked to Hunter Biden's years as an addict.\n\nMore from this section Westport Pride's 4th annual Pride celebration kicks off on the Jesup Green Feeling flush: Japan's high-tech toilets go global Exit Polls 2024: Will BJP Win Over 400 Seats? | Excitement High For The INDIA vs. BJP contest?\n\nThey have called as witnesses three of his former partners, including Lunden Roberts, the mother of one of his children.\n\nThe president's son, who has written unsparingly about his addiction, will contend that at the moment he bought the revolver, he did not consider himself to be an addict. He has stated that he has been sober since 2019.\n\nIf found guilty, Hunter Biden could face 25 years in prison, although as a first-time offender he could get a far lighter sentence or escape any jail time.\n\nPresident Biden on Monday said that his son's difficulties would resonate widely.\n\n\"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\" he said.\n\n- Republican target -\n\nHunter Biden has long been the target of Trump and hard-right Republicans, amplified by exhaustive coverage on Fox News.\n\nLurid photos from his time as an addict have been leaked, and Trump allies have investigated him at length in Congress on allegations of corruption and influence-peddling. However, no charges have ever been brought.\n\nHunter Biden's messy private life and controversial foreign business dealings in China and Ukraine have also formed the basis for attempts by Republicans in Congress to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Biden. Those efforts too have gone nowhere.\n\nThe White House said last year that there would be no presidential pardon for Hunter Biden in case of a conviction.\n\nDemocratic congressman Adam Schiff, a Biden ally, told CNN Sunday that Americans should \"absolutely\" respect the jury's verdict.\n\n\"I think the president himself will respect the verdict -- much as it is painful, I'm sure, to see one of your children on trial.\"\n\nsms/bgs", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The culmination of a sprawling investigation, the deal between Hunter Biden and prosecutors was going to spare him a politically explosive trial in the middle of his father's reelection campaign and likely prison time.\n\nBut it all fell apart.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nNow, Hunter Biden is headed to trial on federal gun charges in a case brought by his father's Justice Department at a time when America's political and legal worlds are colliding like never before. Dogged for years by investigations, scrutinized over his troubled personal life and vilified by Republicans, the younger Biden is now also confronting the threat of felony convictions and time behind bars.\n\nThe case opening Monday with jury selection in Delaware is not about Hunter Biden's business dealings, which have been the focus of the yearslong federal investigation and Republicans' fruitless impeachment inquiry into the Democratic president. It's about a gun Hunter Biden had for about 11 days -- a .38-caliber Colt Cobra Special. Prosecutors say he bought it illegally in October 2018 because he falsely swore on a federal form that he was not a drug user. He never fired the gun, according to his lawyers, and it ended up dumped in a trash can.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe trial will lack details about his foreign business matters that Republicans have seized on to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt, but it is expected to feature deeply personal and embarrassing testimony about dark time in the younger Biden's life. And it probably will provide new political impetus for Donald Trump's allies, who are eager to distract from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's own legal problems after he was convicted of 34 felony counts in his hush money trial.\n\nAllies of Joe Biden are worried about the toll the trial may take on the president, who already is concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as that son's darkest moments are relived in public. They also are worried that the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign while facing anemic poll numbers and is scheduled to prepare in Wilmington for a June 27 debate with Trump as the trial plays out nearby.\n\nTHE DEAL THAT NEVER WAS\n\nIt once looked like Hunter Biden was going to avoid prosecution in the gun case altogether.\n\nThe deal was announced last June. Nearly three years earlier, Hunter Biden had confirmed the federal investigation into his tax affairs in December 2020, shortly after his father was elected.\n\nThe younger Biden would have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses; prosecutors would have recommended two years of probation. There was also a \"diversion agreement\" that would have allowed him to escape prosecution on a felony gun charge as long he stayed out of trouble for two years.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut the plea hearing quickly unraveled.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, quizzed both sides with concerns about the deal. To her, it seemed unusual and required her to be involved in the case in a way most federal judges are not. The lawyers huddled, trying to salvage the deal. At one point they could be heard yelling at each other.\n\n\"Well, we'll just rip it up!\" Chris Clark, Biden's then-attorney, shouted as tempers flared.\n\n\"So what do we do now?\" the judge later asked the lawyers.\n\n\"Then there is no deal,\" prosecutor Leo Wise told her.\n\nA few weeks later, Attorney General Merrick Garland named David Weiss, the Trump-nominated U.S. attorney in Delaware who was leading the investigation, as a special counsel.\n\nHunter Biden was indicted a month after that on three gun counts. They are punishable by up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.\n\nCOURTROOM TENSION\n\nThe bitterness between prosecutors and Hunter Biden's legal team is glaring. It's likely to be on display Monday.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nClark withdrew from the case, saying he might be called to testify in a potential legal dispute over the now-defunct deal. Another defense lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has accused Weiss of caving to political pressure to indict the president's son after Trump and other Republicans blasted the \"sweetheart deal.\" The defense has noted that charges related to gun possession by drug users are rare when not in connection with a more serious crime.\n\n\"Mr. Biden is not being prosecuted for any sin that DOJ (the Department of Justice) believes he has committed. He is being punished for the perceived sins of his father -- the sin of opposing Mr. Trump's election to the president,\" according to court papers filed by Lowell, who also has represented Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the former president's daughter and son-in-law.\n\nProsecutors say Lowell's contention is \"fiction designed for a Hollywood script.\"\n\n\"Contrary to his assertion, he has not established that the Special Counsel, appointed by and serving at the pleasure of President Biden and his Attorney General, is punishing the defendant 'for the perceived sins of his father' in order to capitulate to a former President because of his tweets,\" Weiss' team responded.\n\nWeiss has said \"political considerations\" played no part in the investigation. He told lawmakers behind closed doors last year that that no one at the Justice Department prevented him from pursuing charges or taking other necessary steps, disputing claims from two IRS whistleblowers that the department improperly interfered in the tax investigation.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nA DARK TIME\n\nThe case stems from a period where, by his own admission, Hunter Biden was addicted to crack.\n\nIn his memoir \"Beautiful Things,\" he described becoming consumed by drugs and alcohol after his older brother, Beau, died in 2015 at age 46 from brain cancer. The brothers were very close, having survived a car crash when they were young that killed their mother and baby sister.\n\nHunter Biden has said he has been sober since 2019. But prosecutors intend to use his memoir to make the case that he knew he was addicted to drugs when he denied it on the form that every person must fill out when buying a gun. They plan to show jurors text messages, videos and photos of Hunter Biden smoking crack, as well details about cocaine residue that authorities say was found on the pouch he used to hold his gun.\n\n\"I'm a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I've ruined every relationship I've ever cherished,\" Hunter Biden wrote in one text message weeks after he bought the firearm, according to prosecutors.\n\nJurors are expected to hear testimony from his ex-wife and other former romantic partners, including Beau's widow, Hallie Biden, with whom Hunter Biden had a relationship after his brother's death. Hallie Biden found the gun in Hunter Biden's truck and threw it in a trash. It was found by a man collecting recyclables who gave it to the police.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe defense has suggested it will attack the credibility of the gun shop employees, noting there were changes to the gun-purchase form after the sale. Prosecutors say there were minor additions unrelated to the parts Hunter Biden filled out. His lawyers have suggested they may argue that Hunter Biden did not see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form.\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" the defense wrote in a recent filing. \"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nThe case is expected to last a couple of weeks. He also is scheduled to stand trial in September in California in the case where he is accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over four years.\n\n_____\n\nAssociated Press writer

Instead, Hunter Biden was seen at the White House and in Delaware at his father's side amid what the president's allies acknowledge is a difficult moment for both men.\n\nThey attended a White House state dinner for Kenya last month; marked the ninth anniversary of the death of Beau Biden, the president's eldest son, at church last week; and cycled together along a trail in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on Saturday.\n\nThe president also planned to spend most of Monday in Wilmington, where jury selection for the trial - the first of a sitting US president's child - is underway. He traveled there Sunday evening, arriving earlier than originally planned.\n\nAs proceedings were getting underway, first lady Jill Biden -- who, like her husband, has remained supportive and protective of Hunter amid his addiction and legal problems -- was seen arriving at the courthouse.\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" the president said in a statement Monday.\n\n\"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\" he went on. \"As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength. Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\"\n\nHunter Biden, 54, is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He pleaded not guilty to the three charges, though he has been open about his struggles with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction.\n\nFor the president, the legal problems facing his son have been reason to pull him close, rather than push him away. Joe Biden has paid little mind to some of his allies who question the approach. Instead, his concern for his son's well-being surpasses any potential political fallout, advisers have said.\n\nThat concern has appeared at moments to be all-consuming, including in the darkest moments of Hunter Biden's addiction, when the president and his family desperately sought to head off a self-destructive cycle.\n\nJoe Biden still speaks with or texts with his son almost daily, particularly as his legal issues mounted.\n\nThe president told an interviewer last year his son had done \"nothing wrong,\" and that the only way Hunter Biden's legal issues were affecting his presidency was in creating a surge of fatherly pride.\n\n\"It impacts my presidency by making me feel proud of him,\" he said on MSNBC.\n\nAs the gun trial gets underway, Biden will be heading overseas to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day. There is little question he will remain in regular touch with his son while abroad and will keep abreast of the trial amid a heavy schedule of commemorations, speeches and a state visit in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nBut neither he nor the White House is expected to speak proactively about the trial. Hunter Biden's legal team generally operates separately from the president and his campaign, and there are few who believe there would be much benefit in the president weighing in publicly.\n\nProsecutors have said they plan to call about a dozen witnesses for their case.\n\nMost notably, they've lined up testimony from three of Hunter Biden's former romantic partners to testify about his drug use around the time he bought the gun. This includes his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle; his late brother's widow, Hallie Biden, whom Hunter Biden later dated; and Lunden Roberts, the mother of one of his children.\n\nTheir testimony could bring to life a period that Hunter Biden has described as his rock bottom, during which he was almost always on drugs or trying to get drugs. At his attempted plea hearing last year, Hunter Biden testified that he has been sober since May 2019.\n\nThere was a time last summer when the president and his orbit believed Hunter Biden's legal ordeal would end with a plea deal and that the family would be able to close a dark chapter.\n\nThose hopes were dashed when the agreement fell apart and, weeks later, a special counsel was appointed to oversee the investigation into the president's son, opening the prospect of prolonged legal battles overlapping with Joe Biden's run for reelection.\n\nBut many in Biden's orbit suggest his son's legal issues will not be a driving concern for voters heading into November's election.\n\nStill, few issues are more sensitive inside the Biden White House than the president's son, from his addiction battles to his legal woes.\n\nThat has largely left Hunter Biden and his team to go on their own offense, accusing Republicans and others of trying to use his addiction issues for political profit.\n\n\"They are trying to, in their most illegitimate way, but rational way, they're trying to destroy a presidency,\" Hunter Biden said in a podcast released late last year. \"And so, it's not about me, and ... what they're trying to do is they're trying to kill me, knowing that it will be a pain greater than my father could be able to handle and so therefore destroying a presidency in that way.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The indictment was brought by the Justice Department, specifically by David Weiss, the special counsel appointed last year to oversee the Hunter Biden probes.\n\nHunter Biden, 54, is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He pleaded not guilty to the three charges, though he has been open about his struggles with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction.\n\nThe trial could last one to two weeks and is taking place in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWhat are the charges?\n\nThe first two charges in the three-count indictment are tied to the gun purchase itself.\n\nWhen a person buys a gun, they must fill out a form with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and affirm that they are legally allowed to buy the weapon. Hunter Biden has been charged with lying on those forms.\n\nThese questions include: Have you been convicted of a felony? Are you a fugitive? Are you in the country unlawfully? And, importantly for this case, are you an \"unlawful user of, or addicted to\" illegal drugs? Hunter Biden allegedly checked the box that said, \"No.\"\n\nCount 3 relates to the possession of the gun. It's also against federal law to possess a gun if you are abusing drugs. Hunter Biden had the gun for 11 days in October 2018, before his girlfriend threw it in a dumpster because she was worried about his mental health, according to the indictment and texts made public in recent court filings.\n\n\"Guns present a danger if they get in the wrong hands, and that's the impetus behind these laws,\" Nabeel Kibria, a Washington, DC-based defense attorney who has handled hundreds of gun cases, told CNN. \"The evidence seems pretty stacked against Hunter ... but who determines who is an addict? What are the bright-line rules that must be followed?\"\n\nWho are the witnesses?\n\nProsecutors have said they plan to call about a dozen witnesses for their case.\n\nMost notably, they've lined up testimony from three of Hunter Biden's former romantic partners to testify about his drug use around the time he bought the gun. This includes his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle; his late brother's widow, Hallie Biden, whom Hunter Biden later dated; and Lunden Roberts, the mother of one of his children.\n\nTheir testimony could bring to life a period that Hunter Biden has described as his rock bottom, during which he was almost always on drugs or trying to get drugs. At his attempted plea hearing last year, Hunter Biden testified that he has been sober since May 2019.\n\n\"He's going to experience stress and shame at the trial,\" said Valerie Earnshaw, a social psychology professor at the University of Delaware who researches the stigmas surrounding addiction. \"It depends on his own recovery journey, but there could be days where he experiences a lot of shame. It's a toxic emotion that eats you up. It does not motivate healthy behaviors.\"\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers said they might call an expert who can tell the jury about how people with addictions understand their own struggles. His team also has a forensic chemist who could testify about a white residue on his gun pouch that prosecutors say testified positive for cocaine when it was analyzed by the FBI in 2023.\n\nWho are the prosecutors?\n\nThe case was initiated by Weiss, the former Donald Trump-appointed US attorney in Delaware. Attorney General Merrick Garland elevated Weiss to special counsel status last year, after a proposed plea deal with Hunter Biden blew up in spectacular fashion.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers claimed Weiss only sought the indictment because he caved to a relentless pressure campaign from Republican lawmakers and the former president. Weiss panned this theory as a \"fiction designed for a Hollywood script,\" and the judge overseeing the gun case concluded the allegations were \"nonsensical under the facts here.\"\n\nBut many Republicans have criticized Weiss, claiming he offered Hunter Biden a \"sweetheart deal\" last year that would have resolved the gun matter and ended a tax probe with a misdemeanor-only plea. (Legal experts told CNN at the time that the proposed deal was reasonable.)\n\nWho is the judge?\n\nDistrict Judge Maryellen Noreika is presiding over the case. A former patent lawyer, she had the support of Delaware's two Democratic senators when she was appointed by Trump. The Senate confirmed her nomination with a unanimous voice vote in 2018.\n\nShe oversaw last summer's dramatic hearing during which both sides asked her to approve a plea deal. But she balked and uncovered through tough questioning that there were grave differences between the parties about the scope of the deal. That hearing ended without a resolution, and the plea discussions later collapsed. That's when Garland named Weiss as special counsel.\n\nNoreika's no-nonsense approach has kept the proceedings moving in a steady fashion. She rejected Hunter Biden's attempts to toss the case or derail the prosecution but has sided with him on several key evidentiary questions.\n\nCould Hunter Biden go to prison?\n\nIf convicted on all three counts, the president's son could face up to 25 years in prison.\n\nHowever, he doesn't have a prior criminal record, and first-time offenders often get much lower sentences than the maximum. His punishment would be solely up to Noreika.\n\nThese are federal charges, so Joe Biden has the power to pardon his son at any time. If his son is convicted, the president could also commute the sentence, sparing him from the levied punishment.\n\nThe White House has explicitly ruled out the possibility of a pardon, but that political calculus could change after the November election.\n\nHas this ever happened before?\n\nThis is a historic moment for the United States and the history of the presidency. No president has ever tried to run the country while watching his own child go on trial.\n\nOver the decades, there are plenty of examples of presidential family members getting in trouble. George H. W. Bush's son faced civil penalties for violating banking laws while his father was serving in the White House. Jimmy Carter's brother was scrutinized for his foreign lobbying. But nothing has sunk to the level of a criminal trial.\n\nCNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said that \"there's always somebody considered a black sheep in the presidential family\" but that Hunter Biden's sprawling legal issues \"cut unusually close to the bone because it's the president's son.\"\n\n\"This trial is an albatross around President Biden's neck and weighs very heavily on his psyche,\" Brinkley said. \"For any parent to watch their child go through addiction, and now face possible jail time, it's harrowing. You would hope that family would be his comfort zone. But in this case, family is probably his biggest worry of the moment.\"\n\nThe family ties have also led to some intriguing divergences between father and son.\n\nThere is a separate court battle over the constitutionality of the law that makes it illegal for drug users to own a gun. The Biden administration is defending the law and wants the Supreme Court to take up the matter. But Hunter Biden's team argued in his case - unsuccessfully - that the law violates the Second Amendment.\n\nThe jury pool\n\nApproximately 250 Delaware residents have been summoned for jury service, according to the judge. They'll be whittled down to a panel of 12 seated jurors and four alternates.\n\nDelaware is one of the smallest states in the country, and the Biden family looms large.\n\nAs part of the selection process - called voir dire - prospective jurors will be asked whether they can stay impartial regardless of their views about the 2024 election. They'll also be asked whether they can keep an open mind about Hunter Biden and even whether they've been eligible to vote in past elections for Joe Biden, who has held public office in Delaware since 1971.\n\nOther questions touch on the highly politicized atmosphere surrounding the case, including, \"Do you believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted in this case because his father is the President of the United States?\" or, coming from the other side, whether they think he \"is not being prosecuted for other crimes because his father is the President.\"\n\nWhat has Hunter Biden said?\n\nSince his indictments last year, Hunter Biden hasn't said much about his legal cases.\n\nHe spoke out in December amid his fight with the House Republicans who are probing his business dealings and took responsibility for having \"made mistakes in my life and wasted opportunities and privileges that I was afforded.\" But he slammed the \"MAGA right\" lawmakers who \"ridiculed my struggle with addiction\" and \"belittled my recovery.\"\n\n\"They have tried to dehumanize me, all to embarrass and damage my father,\" he said.\n\nPreviously, Hunter Biden shared intensely personal details about his addiction in his 2021 memoir, which prosecutors plan to use against him at trial. He described his stints in rehab, his relapses, how he bought drugs near the White House, and the stretches of time when he \"had no plan beyond the moment-to-moment demands of the crack pipe.\"\n\nThe laptop, texts and emails\n\nOne of the most notable pieces of evidence in the case will be messages from Hunter Biden's infamous laptop, which has been at the center of a yearslong political saga. Weiss said the material \"is real\" and will be an important part of his case, rebutting past claims from the president's son that the laptop might be fake or even Russian disinformation.\n\nRepublican officials and right-wing outlets have seized on the laptop's embarrassing emails and sexually explicit images to attack Hunter Biden, while his lawyers say the files were manipulated and sued a repair-shop owner who helped make the materials public.\n\nMany on the right celebrated this move by Weiss, even if he hasn't verified their loftier anti-Biden allegations. The New York Post, the conservative tabloid that was first to publish messages from the laptop in 2020, recently took a victory lap on its front cover.\n\nIn a ruling last month, Noreika said she'll let Hunter Biden challenge the authenticity of any messages introduced at trial. Some of the texts contain gut-wrenching arguments between Hunter Biden and his loved ones about his sobriety. Others show him meeting up with drug dealers, including some just a few blocks from the Wilmington federal courthouse.\n\n\"I'm a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I've ruined every relationship I've ever cherished,\" he texted Hallie Biden in October 2018, according to Weiss' filings.\n\nProsecutors plan to use the laptop to specifically support their claim that he was using illegal drugs when he bought the gun in 2018. Weiss has not addressed - and the case is not about - Republicans' unproven allegation that emails from the laptop prove that Hunter Biden and his father were involved in corrupt foreign business deals.\n\nWhat about the tax charges?\n\nThis is just one of two trials Hunter Biden faces this year.\n\nThe second case is scheduled for September in Los Angeles and revolves around Hunter Biden's troubled finances. He has pleaded not guilty to tax evasion, filing false tax returns and failing to file his taxes on time.\n\nOriginally, the trials were both scheduled for June, but Hunter Biden got a reprieve from the California federal judge, who agreed to postpone that trial. But the September trial date means that case will coincide with the final stretch of the presidential campaign.\n\nCNN's Holmes Lybrand contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marshall_cohen@cnn.com", "name": "Marshall Cohen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Buhle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kathleen Buhle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Delaware", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Delaware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crack cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pardon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco,_Firearms_and_Explosives", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fugitive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Brinkley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Brinkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George H.

Now Hunter Biden's gun trial is set to start", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Hunter Biden is set to become the first child of a sitting U.S. president tried for crimes, just days after the historic guilty verdict against Donald Trump -- two events that may inject fresh uncertainty into the 2024 election.\n\nJury selection begins Monday in the first of two cases Hunter Biden has tried to avoid for years, both to stay out of prison and spare his father, President Joe Biden, political and personal turmoil as he runs for a second term most likely against Trump.\n\nThe trial in Wilmington, Delaware, on three federal gun violations is expected to plumb the depths of the younger Biden's drug use. During that period, prosecutors allege he lied about his substance abuse on a federal form to illegally purchase a firearm.\n\nSpecial Counsel David Weiss has indicated he plans to raise painful events from the Biden family's past related to Hunter's conduct and events that involve the president. Still, White House officials largely view the trial as a private matter for Biden's son tied to his personal behavior from years ago.\n\nThe president, who is expected to travel to France during part of the trial, will be monitoring it primarily as a concerned parent who has supported his son's recovery from addiction, according to a person familiar with his thinking.\n\nThere are no plans for the White House to publicly engage with the trial, said the person, who requested anonymity to discuss how the president and his staff view the legal matter. But those plans could change, and the person did not rule out the possibility of the president reacting to developments in real time.\n\nPlea possibility\n\nWhile the possibility exists for a last-minute plea deal between the two sides, Hunter Biden's legal team is prepared to argue the charges are unconstitutional and violate the Second Amendment, as well as point out flaws in the government's evidence.\n\nDick Harpootlian, a Biden ally and former South Carolina prosecutor, said jurors in Biden's home state might wonder why prosecutors brought the criminal case against him now that he's shaken his drug addiction.\n\n\"It only takes one for a hung jury, and I can definitely see one or more jurors questioning the propriety of bringing this case,\" said Harpootlian, who now serves as a state senator.\n\nBiden's trial represents another highly politicized spectacle following the former President Trump's criminal trial in New York, which ended Thursday with his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up an affair with a porn star during the 2016 race.\n\nHunter Biden also has been charged by Weiss in Los Angeles for nine federal tax violations and is scheduled to go on trial in that case in September.\n\nThe gun trial is expected to be short but dramatic, with prosecutors airing details about Hunter Biden's drug-laden years that include excerpts from a book he wrote about it, \"Beautiful Things: A Memoir.\"\n\n\"His book is replete with admissions that establish he knew he was an addict and knew he was using crack cocaine throughout 2018, including in October 2018 when he purchased and possessed the gun,\" prosecutors wrote in a May 20 trial brief.\n\nFordham University law professor Cheryl Bader, an ex-assistant U.S. attorney who now runs the school's criminal law clinic, said Biden's chances of winning an acquittal are slim given his acknowledgment in his memoir.\n\nBiden has been open about his struggles with alcohol and drugs but said he has remained sober since mid-2019.\n\nFederal prosecutors \"only bring cases that they are confident they can win, and they are known for dotting their I's and crossing their T's,\" Bader said.\n\nTwo of the gun counts carry maximum prison time of 10 years; another is punishable by as much as five years. However, judges rarely impose maximum sentences.\n\nBiden's lawyers plan to challenge the government's charge that he bought the gun while a drug addict as constitutionally vague. They are set to argue that he wasn't using drugs when he bought the gun. They also plan to contend that the seller didn't comply with legal requirements in the gun sale and documentation.\n\n\"Intoxication from too much alcohol or using drugs, legal or illegal, may make it too dangerous for people to drive a car, operate heavy machinery, or possess a firearm one day, but they may be perfectly sober enough to do all those things the next day,\" according to a May 23 trial brief by Biden's lawyers.\n\nWeiss was nominated by Trump to serve as the U.S. attorney for Delaware and kept on by Biden. He was appointed as a special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2023 to manage the cases against Hunter Biden.\n\nBiden and Weiss had agreed to a plea deal last year to resolve both allegations, but the agreement fell apart under questioning by the federal judge overseeing the case. Biden's lawyers and supporters have argued that Weiss then bowed to political pressure by Trump and conservatives in bringing the charges.\n\nThe gun case is U.S. v.

He also claimed to have believed that he was sober the day he filled out the form.\n\nThe Post previously reported on images from the first son's laptop showing him asleep with what appears to be a crack pipe in his mouth on Oct. 8, 2018.\n\nHunter Biden later told The Daily Beast that the photograph depicted a meth pipe rather than a crack pipe and alleged that the picture had been staged.\n\nIn his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" Hunter claimed that he was \"smoking crack every 15 minutes\" around the time of the gun purchase.\n\nOn Oct. 11, 2018, the day before Hunter went to buy the gun, he texted a man identified in his contacts as \"q\" asking to meet at a 7-Eleven. \"Q\" asked Hunter if he wanted \"the same\" thing, an apparent reference to drugs.\n\nHe also bought a HKS Speedloader and 25 rounds of ammunition, according to prosecutors, who don't have to prove that the first son was wasted on the day he made the purchases.\n\nHunter Biden held onto the weapon for 11 days before it got tossed into a trash can.\n\nAt the time, Hunter Biden was in the midst of a tryst with his former sister-in-law turned lover Hallie Biden, the widow of his late brother, Beau.\n\nOn Oct. 23, 2018, Hallie Biden, frustrated with Hunter's drug use, discovered the .38-caliber revolver in his unlocked car and discarded it -- wrapped in a black shopping bag -- behind a supermarket located across the street from a local high school.\n\nThis did not go over well with Hunter Biden, who launched a barrage of profane text messages at her upon learning what she had done.\n\nHunter demanded that Hallie return to the trash can and retrieve the firearm for him, but when she did, it was gone, according to a police report unearthed by Politico in March 2021. Hallie then contacted the store's management, which drew in law enforcement.\n\nWhen cops called Hunter Biden to the scene, he claimed to have used the firearm for target practice.\n\nHunter Biden waved off questions about whether he was using drugs by suggesting Hallie had thought \"I was gonna kill myself,\" per the report.\n\nWhen asked if he had spoken about the issue with his father, then the former vice president, Hunter responded: \"I have never called my dad for anything.\"\n\nDays later, the gun was turned in by an older man who regularly went through the store's trash for recyclable items.\n\nIn court filings last month, prosecutors noted that the FBI had interviewed the Wilmington gun store owner, Ron Palimere, who said that both Delaware State Police and Secret Service agents visited his business the day after the .38-caliber revolver went missing.\n\n\"They said the firearm was involved in a case of some kind and they wanted to expedite the trace process and get access to the Form 4473,\" the FBI document outlining Palimere's interview states, referring to the transaction record filled out by Hunter. \"Both agencies asked the same questions and it appeared they were not aware of each other's investigations.\"\n\nSuspicious of the request by the Secret Service, Palimere contacted an ATF agent, who told him, in the FBI's words, \"not to turn the original Form 4473 over to anyone and to turn over a copy only if Palimere felt Palimere had to.\"\n\nThe Secret Service has said it has no information corroborating Palimere's claims, noting the Biden family was not under the agency's protection at the time.\n\nDavid Weiss has been US Attorney for Delaware since 2018, having been nominated to that position under Trump, with the support of the First State's two Democratic US senators, both Biden allies.\n\nWeiss' office has been investigating Hunter Biden on a number of tracks, including the gun charge, tax evasion and allegations of unregistered foreign lobbying.\n\nIn December 2020 -- a month after his father won the presidency -- Hunter Biden confirmed publicly that he was subject to a federal probe into his \"tax affairs.\"\n\nIn June 2023, prosecutors announced a plea deal on tax charges against the first son and a pretrial diversion agreement on the gun charges.\n\nAs a result, he was expected to get about two years of probation contingent on him remaining sober.\n\nBut that agreement went up in flames the following month when Delaware US District Judge Maryellen Noreika exposed daylight between the defense and prosecution over whether or not Hunter would enjoy blanket immunity.\n\nOn Aug. 11, 2023, Attorney General Merrick Garland elevated Weiss to special counsel status, giving him the authority to bring charges against the first son wherever he wished.\n\nOn Sept. 14, Weiss' team announced that a grand jury had returned the firearm indictment against the first son.\n\nAhead of the trial, attorneys for the first son have made several attempts to quash the case, all of which have failed so far.\n\nOne notable argument is that the charges against Hunter violated his Second Amendment rights on the grounds that \"past drug use\" is no longer sufficient to deny gun ownership following a landmark Supreme Court ruling in 2022.\n\nNoreika, who will also be the presiding judge at trial, rejected that claim, saying laws against drug addicts owning firearms are \"consistent with this country's historical tradition of firearm regulation.\"\n\nThe defense team has also suggested that the 4473 form may have been \"tampered with\" by an employee at the gun store who helped Hunter Biden fill it out.\n\nThe Justice Department has included a photo of Hunter Biden's signature on the form as evidence.\n\nBut lead defense attorney Abbe Lowell has teased there might be more to the case.\n\nIn their trial brief, prosecutors teased plans to call at least nine witnesses, mainly officials from the FBI, Delaware State Police, and Drug Enforcement Administration -- along with \"an employee of Starquest Shooters,\" possibly Palimere, and three individuals identified as Witness 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThe Post has identified those witnesses based on the description provided by prosecutors as Hunter's ex-wife Kathleen Buhle, ex-girlfriend Zoe Kestan, and Hallie Biden.\n\nBuhle tied the knot with Hunter Biden in 1993 and the pair split in 2017, not long after she learned that he was having an affair with his sister-in-law, according to her book, \"If We Break.\"\n\nEven after the divorce was finalized, Buhle continued to express concerns about her ex's addiction struggles, writing in a March 9, 2018, message that she \"found a few crack pipes\" in the family car and removed them because their \"daughter was driving\" it at the time.\"\n\nKestan -- a lingerie and textile designer who uses \"weed_slut_420\" as her social media handle -- testified before a Delaware grand jury back in 2022, The Post previously reported.\n\nKestan allegedly claimed to have been with Hunter \"at the craziest point of his life\" and stated that during the roughly nine months of their relationship, he smoked crack cocaine about \"every 20 minutes except when he slept.\"\n\nAside from those witnesses, prosecutors will also be allowed to cite evidence from Hunter Biden's \"laptop from hell,\" though the defense will be able to challenge exhibits on a case-by-case basis.\n\nProsecutors have also indicated they will reference his memoir,\" Beautiful Things.\"\n\nWhile the president has not spoken publicly about the case, the White House has repeatedly insisted that the president will not pardon his son should he be convicted.\n\n\"I've been very clear; the president is not going to pardon his son,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reiterated back in December.\n\nBehind the scenes, President Biden is reportedly very anxious that his son could wind up behind bars. And there have been some conspicuous crossing of paths on the eve of the trial.\n\nOn May 26, President Biden met with Hallie Biden, a move that raised some eyebrows given that she's expected to be a star witness.\n\nThree days earlier, Hunter Biden was present at a White House State dinner honoring visiting Kenyan President William Ruto which Garland also attended.\n\nNoreika was nominated to the bench by Trump and confirmed by the Senate in August 2018 -- again with support from both of Delaware's Democratic senators.\n\nAt Pittsburgh native, Noreika holds an undergraduate degree from Lehigh University, a master's degree in biology from Columbia University and a law degree from the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nNoreika has given campaign donations to candidates on both sides of the aisle, with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), a particular favorite.\n\nHunter Biden's main lawyer responding to Weiss' probe was Chris Clark, who played a critical role in negotiating the aborted plea and diversion agreements.\n\nIn August 2023, Clark withdrew fom the case due to the possibility that he could be called as a witness to discuss deliberations with prosecutors.\n\nClark had previously hinted at plans to bring President Biden to the stand if the agreement failed.\n\n\"President Biden now unquestionably would be a fact witness for the defense in any criminal trial,\" Clark wrote at one point, Politico reported.\n\nLowell, a Winston & Strawn partner, then took a more pronounced role in Hunter Biden's defense. He previously represented Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and has also helped the first son navigate through the onslaught of House Republican investigations.\n\nIn addition to Lowell, the first son has tapped Dalton Bartholomew of Dalton & Associates and more recently brought on David Kolansky, who previously helped Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ).\n\nSince his father took office as president, Hunter Biden's primary patron has been Hollywood lawyer Kevin Morris, sometimes referred to as the first son's \"sugar brother.\"\n\nMorris, 60, testified before the House GOP impeachment inquiry back in January that he loaned the first son more than $4.9 million and had visited the White House on at least three occasions during that timeframe.\n\nOther recent reports peg that figure at around $6.5 million. Morris' cash flow to the troubled first son covered everything from divorce costs, back taxes, a paternity suit, car payments, and more.\n\nHe has also quietly worked on a gauzy documentary about the Biden scion, assisted him with publishing his memoir, helped him find a new home, and reportedly purchased some of his top-dollar works of art.\n\nBut now there are questions about whether Morris' resources are drying up.\n\n\"Kevin is completely tapped out. So just when Hunter is facing two criminal trials starting in a few weeks, he has no resources. It's pretty dire,\" a source familiar with the situation recently told Politico.\n\nIn addition to the firearm case, Hunter Biden is also staring down a tax indictment that Weiss secured from a grand jury out of Los Angeles in December.\n\nHe is facing six misdemeanor and three felony counts for allegedly stiffing Uncle Sam of $1.4 million in federal taxes between 2016 and 2019. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nHunter Biden has since paid off that lien, thanks to a loan from Morris.\n\nThat trial, which had initially been slated for June 20, is now set to begin Sept. 5 after federal judge Mark Scarsi delayed it last week.\n\nSpeculation has also swirled about possible charges under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), which is governed under a five-year statute of limitations. Weiss has maintained that his investigation remains \"ongoing.\"\n\nFARA requires individuals to disclose when they're acting on behalf of foreign principals in a bid to influence US officials.\n\nDetractors have pointed to Hunter Biden's position on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma from 2014 until 2019, and his 10% stake in Chinese state-backed investment fund BHR Partners between 2013 and part of 2021, among other concerns.\n\nYet the clock appears to be running out on some of those potential avenues.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.), who is leading an impeachment inquiry into the president, has also dangled the possibility of unspecified criminal referrals.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York

(AP) -- A federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter opened Monday with jury selection, following the collapse of a plea deal that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden was seated in the front row of the courtroom, in a show of support for her son.\n\nIn a statement, the president said he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants by saying he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nIn Delaware, prospective jurors who answered \"yes\" on a questionnaire were quizzed individually by Judge Maryellen Noreika to determine whether they could be fair and impartial. One by one, they were dismissed, winnowing down the pool.\n\nThe questions ranged from their knowledge of the case to their thoughts about gun ownership and whether they or anyone close to them have struggled with substance abuse or addiction or ever owned a gun. Other questions focused on the role politics may have played in the charges.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOne prospective juror said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she replied when an attorney asked her opinion. Another prospective juror was dismissed because his family has a long history in law enforcement, and he said he could not be impartial. A third was excused because he was very aware of the case, and, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nOnly one potential juror answered \"no\" to all the questions and moved on to the next phase. Another who was not dismissed said he holds a concealed carry permit and owns three handguns. The man said he has strong views on gun ownership and believes every law-abiding citizen should be able to own a gun.\n\n\"I believe the Second Amendment is very important,\" he explained.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first to the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court, and his wife Melissa. The president in Wilmington until he left for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They will also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nIf convicted, he faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

He has long struggled with addiction issues and a troubled private life.\n\nThe president's son has acknowledged struggling with an addiction to crack cocaine during that period in 2018, but his lawyers have said he didn't break the law. In his memoir Beautiful Things, he described becoming consumed by drugs and alcohol after his older brother, Beau, died in 2015 at age 46 from brain cancer. The brothers were very close, having survived a car crash when they were young that killed their mother and baby sister.\n\nRelated: Hunter Biden gun trial to begin next month after judge denies bid to delay\n\nHunter Biden has said he has been sober since 2019. But prosecutors intend to use his memoir to make the case that he knew he was addicted to drugs when he denied it on the form that every person must fill out when buying a gun.\n\nA plea deal aimed at avoiding a trial collapsed last year, though it is possible some form of pact could still be revived as the trial starts to play out. But one thing seen as certain this is that Republicans will use Hunter Biden's trial - and another more serious one over tax issues set for September - as a weapon to attack Joe Biden, as they have sought to do for several years.\n\nRepublicans will no doubt be motivated by Trump's host of legal travails. The former president seen as a lock to be the party's 2024 nominee was found guilty last week of falsifying business records linked to hush-money payments to adult film actor Stormy Daniels to cover an affair that was seen as potentially harming his 2016 election prospects. Like Hunter Biden, Trump too could face jail, though that also is seen as unlikely.\n\nThe timing of the trial is unfortunate for Democrats, who are seeking to highlight Trump's historic first of being the only US president to become a felon. But Joe Biden, in keeping with his reputation as a close family man, has stuck by Hunter Biden through all his troubles and that is unlikely to change during the trial which is expected to last a week or so.\n\nHowever, the trial could air potentially embarrassing family details.\n\nDavid C Weiss, special counsel overseeing the prosecution, has signaled he will call Hunter Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, to the stand. Prosecutors also may call Hallie Biden, the widow of Joe Biden's son Beau, who died of brain cancer.

The indictment was brought by the Justice Department, specifically by David Weiss, the special counsel appointed last year to oversee the Hunter Biden probes.\n\nHunter Biden, 54, is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He pleaded not guilty to the three charges, though he has been open about his struggles with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction.\n\nThe trial could last one to two weeks and is taking place in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWhen a person buys a gun, they must fill out a form with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and affirm that they are legally allowed to buy the weapon. Hunter Biden has been charged with lying on those forms.\n\nThese questions include: Have you been convicted of a felony? Are you a fugitive? Are you in the country unlawfully? And, importantly for this case, are you an \"unlawful user of, or addicted to\" illegal drugs? Hunter Biden allegedly checked the box that said, \"No.\"\n\nCount 3 relates to the possession of the gun. It's also against federal law to possess a gun if you are abusing drugs. Hunter Biden had the gun for 11 days in October 2018, before his girlfriend threw it in a dumpster because she was worried about his mental health, according to the indictment and texts made public in recent court filings.\n\n\"Guns present a danger if they get in the wrong hands, and that's the impetus behind these laws,\" Nabeel Kibria, a Washington, DC-based defense attorney who has handled hundreds of gun cases, told CNN. \"The evidence seems pretty stacked against Hunter ... but who determines who is an addict? What are the bright-line rules that must be followed?\"\n\nWho are the witnesses?\n\nProsecutors have said they plan to call about a dozen witnesses for their case.\n\nMost notably, they've lined up testimony from three of Hunter Biden's former romantic partners to testify about his drug use around the time he bought the gun. This includes his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle; his late brother's widow, Hallie Biden, whom Hunter Biden later dated; and Lunden Roberts, the mother of one of his children.\n\nTheir testimony could bring to life a period that Hunter Biden has described as his rock bottom, during which he was almost always on drugs or trying to get drugs. At his attempted plea hearing last year, Hunter Biden testified that he has been sober since May 2019.\n\n\"He's going to experience stress and shame at the trial,\" said Valerie Earnshaw, a social psychology professor at the University of Delaware who researches the stigmas surrounding addiction. \"It depends on his own recovery journey, but there could be days where he experiences a lot of shame. It's a toxic emotion that eats you up. It does not motivate healthy behaviors.\"\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers said they might call an expert who can tell the jury about how people with addictions understand their own struggles. His team also has a forensic chemist who could testify about a white residue on his gun pouch that prosecutors say testified positive for cocaine when it was analyzed by the FBI in 2023.\n\nWho are the prosecutors?\n\nThe case was initiated by Weiss, the former Donald Trump-appointed US attorney in Delaware. Attorney General Merrick Garland elevated Weiss to special counsel status last year, after a proposed plea deal with Hunter Biden blew up in spectacular fashion.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers claimed Weiss only sought the indictment because he caved to a relentless pressure campaign from Republican lawmakers and the former president. Weiss panned this theory as a \"fiction designed for a Hollywood script,\" and the judge overseeing the gun case concluded the allegations were \"nonsensical under the facts here.\"\n\nBut many Republicans have criticized Weiss, claiming he offered Hunter Biden a \"sweetheart deal\" last year that would have resolved the gun matter and ended a tax probe with a misdemeanor-only plea. (Legal experts told CNN at the time that the proposed deal was reasonable.)\n\nWho is the judge?\n\nDistrict Judge Maryellen Noreika is presiding over the case. A former patent lawyer, she had the support of Delaware's two Democratic senators when she was appointed by Trump. The Senate confirmed her nomination with a unanimous voice vote in 2018.\n\nShe oversaw last summer's dramatic hearing during which both sides asked her to approve a plea deal. But she balked and uncovered through tough questioning that there were grave differences between the parties about the scope of the deal. That hearing ended without a resolution, and the plea discussions later collapsed. That's when Garland named Weiss as special counsel.\n\nNoreika's no-nonsense approach has kept the proceedings moving in a steady fashion. She rejected Hunter Biden's attempts to toss the case or derail the prosecution but has sided with him on several key evidentiary questions.\n\nCould Hunter Biden go to prison?\n\nIf convicted on all three counts, the president's son could face up to 25 years in prison.\n\nHowever, he doesn't have a prior criminal record, and first-time offenders often get much lower sentences than the maximum. His punishment would be solely up to Noreika.\n\nThese are federal charges, so Joe Biden has the power to pardon his son at any time. If his son is convicted, the president could also commute the sentence, sparing him from the levied punishment.\n\nThe White House has explicitly ruled out the possibility of a pardon, but that political calculus could change after the November election.\n\nHas this ever happened before?\n\nThis is a historic moment for the United States and the history of the presidency. No president has ever tried to run the country while watching his own child go on trial.\n\nOver the decades, there are plenty of examples of presidential family members getting in trouble. George H. W. Bush's son faced civil penalties for violating banking laws while his father was serving in the White House. Jimmy Carter's brother was scrutinized for his foreign lobbying. But nothing has sunk to the level of a criminal trial.\n\nCNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said that \"there's always somebody considered a black sheep in the presidential family\" but that Hunter Biden's sprawling legal issues \"cut unusually close to the bone because it's the president's son.\"\n\n\"This trial is an albatross around President Biden's neck and weighs very heavily on his psyche,\" Brinkley said. \"For any parent to watch their child go through addiction, and now face possible jail time, it's harrowing. You would hope that family would be his comfort zone. But in this case, family is probably his biggest worry of the moment.\"\n\nThe family ties have also led to some intriguing divergences between father and son.\n\nThere is a separate court battle over the constitutionality of the law that makes it illegal for drug users to own a gun. The Biden administration is defending the law and wants the Supreme Court to take up the matter. But Hunter Biden's team argued in his case - unsuccessfully - that the law violates the Second Amendment.\n\nThe jury pool\n\nApproximately 250 Delaware residents have been summoned for jury service, according to the judge. They'll be whittled down to a panel of 12 seated jurors and four alternates.\n\nDelaware is one of the smallest states in the country, and the Biden family looms large.\n\nAs part of the selection process - called voir dire - prospective jurors will be asked whether they can stay impartial regardless of their views about the 2024 election. They'll also be asked whether they can keep an open mind about Hunter Biden and even whether they've been eligible to vote in past elections for Joe Biden, who has held public office in Delaware since 1971.\n\nOther questions touch on the highly politicized atmosphere surrounding the case, including, \"Do you believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted in this case because his father is the President of the United States?\" or, coming from the other side, whether they think he \"is not being prosecuted for other crimes because his father is the President.\"\n\nWhat has Hunter Biden said?\n\nSince his indictments last year, Hunter Biden hasn't said much about his legal cases.\n\nHe spoke out in December amid his fight with the House Republicans who are probing his business dealings and took responsibility for having \"made mistakes in my life and wasted opportunities and privileges that I was afforded.\" But he slammed the \"MAGA right\" lawmakers who \"ridiculed my struggle with addiction\" and \"belittled my recovery.\"\n\n\"They have tried to dehumanize me, all to embarrass and damage my father,\" he said.\n\nPreviously, Hunter Biden shared intensely personal details about his addiction in his 2021 memoir, which prosecutors plan to use against him at trial. He described his stints in rehab, his relapses, how he bought drugs near the White House, and the stretches of time when he \"had no plan beyond the moment-to-moment demands of the crack pipe.\"\n\nThe laptop, texts and emails\n\nOne of the most notable pieces of evidence in the case will be messages from Hunter Biden's infamous laptop, which has been at the center of a yearslong political saga. Weiss said the material \"is real\" and will be an important part of his case, rebutting past claims from the president's son that the laptop might be fake or even Russian disinformation.\n\nRepublican officials and right-wing outlets have seized on the laptop's embarrassing emails and sexually explicit images to attack Hunter Biden, while his lawyers say the files were manipulated and sued a repair-shop owner who helped make the materials public.\n\nMany on the right celebrated this move by Weiss, even if he hasn't verified their loftier anti-Biden allegations. The New York Post, the conservative tabloid that was first to publish messages from the laptop in 2020, recently took a victory lap on its front cover.\n\nIn a ruling last month, Noreika said she'll let Hunter Biden challenge the authenticity of any messages introduced at trial. Some of the texts contain gut-wrenching arguments between Hunter Biden and his loved ones about his sobriety. Others show him meeting up with drug dealers, including some just a few blocks from the Wilmington federal courthouse.\n\n\"I'm a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I've ruined every relationship I've ever cherished,\" he texted Hallie Biden in October 2018, according to Weiss' filings.\n\nProsecutors plan to use the laptop to specifically support their claim that he was using illegal drugs when he bought the gun in 2018. Weiss has not addressed - and the case is not about - Republicans' unproven allegation that emails from the laptop prove that Hunter Biden and his father were involved in corrupt foreign business deals.\n\nWhat about the tax charges?\n\nThis is just one of two trials Hunter Biden faces this year.\n\nThe second case is scheduled for September in Los Angeles and revolves around Hunter Biden's troubled finances. He has pleaded not guilty to tax evasion, filing false tax returns and failing to file his taxes on time.\n\nOriginally, the trials were both scheduled for June, but Hunter Biden got a reprieve from the California federal judge, who agreed to postpone that trial. But the September trial date means that case will coincide with the final stretch of the presidential campaign.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Buhle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kathleen Buhle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Delaware", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Delaware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crack cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pardon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco,_Firearms_and_Explosives", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fugitive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social stigma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Brinkley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Brinkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George H.

Fully 79 percent of Republican voters warn against pardoning Hunter, compared to 52 percent of Democrats.\n\nVoters were split over whether the younger Biden could get a fair trial in Delaware.\n\nWhile 44 percent of respondents said the proceedings would be even-handed, another 31 percent said they would not.\n\nAnother quarter of voters said they were not sure.\n\nAmericans aged 65 and above, white people, and Democratic voters were more likely to say Hunter would get a fair trial.\n\nThe survey has a +/-2.4 percent error margin. It was carried out in late May by TIPP, which is noted for the accuracy of its polls.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from the legal troubles of their likely nominee for this year's presidential election, Trump.\n\nThe case brought by US Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, last September.\n\nVoters are divided over whether the commander-in-chief's son can get a fair trial\n\nHunter Biden was charged with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018.\n\nWeiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden since at least 2019, also brought the tax charges.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences.\n\nHunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday.\n\nPotential jurors will be screened for their ability to commit to serving the length of the trial, which is expected to run through the end of next week.\n\nAll 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nThe case is expected to center on Hunter's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography\n\nHe told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for 'no' next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nProsecution lawyers revealed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter's phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers.\n\nA plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Biden.\n\nCongressional Republicans spent years in vain trying to find evidence of a corrupt link between Hunter's foreign business dealings, including work for Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and his father's political power.\n\nWith agencies.", "source": {"uri":

AP\n\nThe 54-year-old denies three felony counts stemming from his purchase of a .38-caliber Colt Cobra revolver in 2018 when, by his own admission, he was heavily addicted to drugs.\n\nThe Yale-trained lawyer and lobbyist-turned-artist has been plagued by legal troubles and controversies that have been a drag on his father's campaign, mostly connected to alcoholism and crack cocaine addiction.\n\nIn the latest chapter in his troubled life, Hunter Biden will be tried in the family's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, on two counts of making false statements on paperwork for the gun purchase that he was not using drugs illegally.\n\nHe faces a third charge that he illegally possessed the gun -- which he had for only 11 days in October 2018.\n\nThe prosecution is a public relations test for the Democrats, coming just days after another historic event -- Republican White House nominee Donald Trump becoming the first former US president to be criminally convicted.\n\nBiden campaign aides face the challenge of ensuring that daily responses to journalists' questions about the trial do not force Trump's own legal battles out of the headlines.\n\nIf found guilty, Hunter Biden could in theory face 25 years in prison, though in practice such offenses, if not accompanied by other charges, are seldom punished by jail time.\n\nJurors will hear about the defendant's excessive drug use as prosecutors run through the series of events that led to him buying the firearm in Delaware before it was thrown into a grocery store trash can by his girlfriend.\n\nThe younger Biden, who says he has been sober since 2019, chronicled his longtime struggles with drug addiction in his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things\" -- writing in one eye-watering extract that he was \"smoking crack every 15 minutes.\"\n\nThe book is almost certain to be brought up at trial, with prosecutors expected to lean in on sections in which Biden describes being an addict for four years up to March 2019.\n\nThe defense team has pushed for narrow definitions of the terms \"addict\" and \"user\" and requested instructions requiring an acquittal if the jury determines that the defendant did not consider himself to fit those definitions.\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" his lawyer Abbe Lowell wrote in court documents.\n\n\"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nThe case comes with Republicans pursuing an impeachment inquiry in Congress into what they claim is a Biden family criminal conspiracy, although they have provided no evidence that the president did anything wrong.\n\nRepublican politicians have accused Hunter Biden of engaging in corrupt business practices in China and Ukraine but he has not been charged with any crimes related to his foreign business dealings.\n\nThe president has repeatedly said he stands by his son and loves him for his attempts to recover from drug addiction, while the White House has not commented on the investigation itself.\n\nProsecutors have said they expect to take three days to present their case, and the entire trial will likely last about two weeks.\n\nHunter Biden faces separate tax evasion charges in his home state of California, in a case set to go to trial later in the year.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg", "dataType": "news", "title":

The culmination of a sprawling investigation, the deal between Hunter Biden and prosecutors was going to spare him a politically explosive trial in the middle of his father's reelection campaign and likely prison time.\n\nBut it all fell apart.\n\nNow, Hunter Biden is in court on trial on federal gun charges in a case brought by his father's Justice Department at a time when America's political and legal worlds are colliding like never before. Dogged for years by investigations, scrutinized over his troubled personal life and vilified by Republicans, the younger Biden is now also confronting the threat of felony convictions and time behind bars.\n\nThe case that opened Monday with jury selection in Delaware is not about Hunter Biden's business dealings, which have been the focus of the yearslong federal investigation and Republicans' fruitless impeachment inquiry into the Democratic president. It's about a gun Hunter Biden had for about 11 days -- a .38-caliber Colt Cobra Special. Prosecutors say he bought it illegally in October 2018 because he falsely swore on a federal form that he was not a drug user. He never fired the gun, according to his lawyers, and it ended up dumped in a trash can.\n\nThe trial will lack details about his foreign business matters that Republicans have seized on to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt, but it is expected to feature deeply personal and embarrassing testimony about dark time in the younger Biden's life. And it probably will provide new political impetus for Donald Trump's allies, who are eager to distract from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's own legal problems after he was convicted of 34 felony counts in his hush money trial.\n\nAllies of Joe Biden are worried about the toll the trial may take on the president, who already is concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as that son's darkest moments are relived in public. They also are worried that the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign while facing anemic poll numbers and is scheduled to prepare in Wilmington for a June 27 debate with Trump as the trial plays out nearby.\n\nThe deal that never was\n\nIt once looked like Hunter Biden was going to avoid prosecution in the gun case altogether.\n\nThe deal was announced last June. Nearly three years earlier, Hunter Biden had confirmed the federal investigation into his tax affairs in December 2020, shortly after his father was elected.\n\nThe younger Biden would have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses; prosecutors would have recommended two years of probation. There was also a \"diversion agreement\" that would have allowed him to escape prosecution on a felony gun charge as long he stayed out of trouble for two years.\n\nBut the plea hearing quickly unraveled.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, quizzed both sides with concerns about the deal. To her, it seemed unusual and required her to be involved in the case in a way most federal judges are not. The lawyers huddled, trying to salvage the deal. At one point they could be heard yelling at each other.\n\n\"Well, we'll just rip it up!\" Chris Clark, Biden's then-attorney, shouted as tempers flared.\n\n\"So what do we do now?\" the judge later asked the lawyers.\n\n\"Then there is no deal,\" prosecutor Leo Wise told her.\n\nA few weeks later, Attorney General Merrick Garland named David Weiss, the Trump-nominated U.S. attorney in Delaware who was leading the investigation, as a special counsel.\n\nHunter Biden was indicted a month after that on three gun counts. They are punishable by up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.\n\nCourtroom tension\n\nThe bitterness between prosecutors and Hunter Biden's legal team is glaring.\n\nClark withdrew from the case, saying he might be called to testify in a potential legal dispute over the now-defunct deal. Another defense lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has accused Weiss of caving to political pressure to indict the president's son after Trump and other Republicans blasted the \"sweetheart deal.\" The defense has noted that charges related to gun possession by drug users are rare when not in connection with a more serious crime.\n\n\"Mr. Biden is not being prosecuted for any sin that DOJ (the Department of Justice) believes he has committed. He is being punished for the perceived sins of his father -- the sin of opposing Mr. Trump's election to the president,\" according to court papers filed by Lowell, who also has represented Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the former president's daughter and son-in-law.\n\nProsecutors say Lowell's contention is \"fiction designed for a Hollywood script.\"\n\n\"Contrary to his assertion, he has not established that the Special Counsel, appointed by and serving at the pleasure of President Biden and his Attorney General, is punishing the defendant 'for the perceived sins of his father' in order to capitulate to a former President because of his tweets,\" Weiss' team responded.\n\nWeiss has said \"political considerations\" played no part in the investigation. He told lawmakers behind closed doors last year that that no one at the Justice Department prevented him from pursuing charges or taking other necessary steps, disputing claims from two IRS whistleblowers that the department improperly interfered in the tax investigation.\n\nA dark time\n\nThe case stems from a period where, by his own admission, Hunter Biden was addicted to crack.\n\nIn his memoir \"Beautiful Things,\" he described becoming consumed by drugs and alcohol after his older brother, Beau, died in 2015 at age 46 from brain cancer. The brothers were very close, having survived a car crash when they were young that killed their mother and baby sister.\n\nHunter Biden has said he has been sober since 2019. But prosecutors intend to use his memoir to make the case that he knew he was addicted to drugs when he denied it on the form that every person must fill out when buying a gun. They plan to show jurors text messages, videos and photos of Hunter Biden smoking crack, as well details about cocaine residue that authorities say was found on the pouch he used to hold his gun.\n\n\"I'm a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I've ruined every relationship I've ever cherished,\" Hunter Biden wrote in one text message weeks after he bought the firearm, according to prosecutors.\n\nJurors are expected to hear testimony from his ex-wife and other former romantic partners, including Beau's widow, Hallie Biden, with whom Hunter Biden had a relationship after his brother's death. Hallie Biden found the gun in Hunter Biden's truck and threw it in a trash. It was found by a man collecting recyclables who gave it to the police.\n\nThe defense has suggested it will attack the credibility of the gun shop employees, noting there were changes to the gun-purchase form after the sale. Prosecutors say there were minor additions unrelated to the parts Hunter Biden filled out. His lawyers have suggested they may argue that Hunter Biden did not see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form.\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" the defense wrote in a recent filing. \"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nThe case is expected to last a couple of weeks. He also is scheduled to stand trial in September in California in the case where he is accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over four years.", "source": {"uri": "mynbc5.com",

Here's everything you need to know about the case.", "body": "Hunter Biden is scheduled to stand trial this week in a Delaware federal court on charges that he failed to disclose his drug use on a form when purchasing a gun in 2018. Jury selection will take place on Monday -- days after former President Donald Trump was found guilty on 34 charges of falsifying business records.\n\nThe 54-year-old son of President Joe Biden will be the first child of a sitting president to be a defendant in a criminal trial. With November's 2024 presidential election just months away, the trial is expected to provide fuel for Trump's allies following a failed attempt by Republicans to impeach Joe Biden.\n\nHere's what you need to know ahead of Hunter Biden's trial this week.\n\nIn September 2023, U.S. special counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, charged the president's son with three firearm felonies. They include:\n\nHunter Biden, a first-time offender, pleaded not guilty to all three charges, which carry a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison.\n\nIn October 2018, Biden purchased a .38-caliber Colt revolver from a gun store, StarQuest Shooters & Survival Supply in Wilmington, Del.\n\nAnyone who purchases a firearm is required to provide identification and fill out a form that's collected by federal authorities. The form asks whether the purchaser is an unlawful user or is addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. The younger Biden, who's been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine and claims to have been sober since May 2019, is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form, despite using drugs during that time.\n\nWhile lying on the form is considered a felony, prosecutions for it are extremely rare. According to a 2018 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, only 12 of the 12,700 referred cases in 2017 were investigated by U.S. attorney offices as of June 2018.\n\nHunter owned the gun for 11 days -- from Oct. 12 to Oct. 23, 2018 -- before it was recovered in the trash outside Janssen's Market in Greenville, Del. It was placed there by Hallie Biden, the widow of Hunter's late brother Beau Biden, who Hunter was dating at the time, according to the September 2023 indictment.\n\nA leaked 2018 police report, published by Politico in March 2021, revealed that Hallie Biden told police that she found the gun in Hunter Biden's vehicle before putting it in a bag and throwing it in the trash outside Janssen's. After confronting Hunter Biden about the gun, he implored her to drive back and retrieve it.\n\nWhen she did, Hallie discovered that the gun was no longer there.\n\nHallie Biden eventually confessed about the gun drop to a Janssens's store employee, who then called the police. Hunter Biden met Hallie Biden and the Delaware State Police at the store 30 minutes later. He told police that he purchased the gun for target practice but hadn't shot it yet.\n\nHunter Biden, Hallie Biden and store employees told police that a homeless man, who routinely collected cans from trash in the area, may have taken the gun. About a week later, officers confirmed the man had found the gun in the trash and stashed it inside a box at his home. The police seized the gun when they found it.\n\nThe trial will be overseen by Judge Maryellen Noreika and is expected to explore Hunter Biden's past drug abuse with potentially embarrassing testimony about his 2018 gun purchase. As reported by NBC News, the case may \"distract or distress\" Joe Biden amid his presidential campaign while fueling Trump's allies, who are eager to distract from Trump's own legal problems.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, Hallie Biden is expected to testify in the case as well as a former state police officer who wrote the 2018 police report. Gordon Cleveland, an employee of the gun store where Hunter bought the gun, is also expected to testify. Kathleen Buhle, who was married to the president's son from 1993 to 2017, is another expected witness.\n\nKevin Morris, a Los Angeles lawyer who has provided Hunter Biden with millions of dollars in loans over the years, is reportedly running out of money to alleviate the younger Biden's financial woes.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, this potential decrease in funding is likely to add more stress to Hunter Biden's legal team as it may limit their ability to hire expert witnesses or other specialists in the gun case or in his forthcoming trial on tax charges in California.\n\nThe president's son faces tax evasion charges in a separate California case set for trial in September. In that case, he was indicted on nine tax charges -- three felonies and six misdemeanors -- related to $1.4 million in unpaid taxes between 2016 and 2019.\n\nWhile those back taxes have since been paid back, Hunter could still face a maximum of 17 years in prison if convicted in that case.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

On Monday, he will become the first son of a sitting U.S. president to go on trial. This week, Hunter Biden will be tried on three gun-related charges that carry a maximum sentence of 25 years. The prosecutor accuses him of lying on two forms where he stated that he was free of addictions when he bought a .38-caliber revolver in October 2018 and of possessing and illegally obtained firearm for a few days. The defendant has pleaded not guilty. The trial begins on Monday in Wilmington (Delaware) in a country still reeling from former president Donald Trump's conviction on 34 felonies in New York.\n\n\"No one is above the law,\" said President Biden on Friday in his first statement about the jury's verdict against his predecessor. Neither is his own son. In a twist of fate, the building where the trial is being held is named after J. Caleb Boggs, the Republican senator whose seat was taken in the 1972 election by a young and promising 29-year-old Democratic politician. That politician, Joe Biden, is the tenant of the White House more than half a century later.\n\nRepublicans have regarded Hunter Biden as the president's weak point for years. Although their attempts to link the president to kickbacks and influence peddling connected to his son's businesses have failed miserably (the FBI informant who accused the Bidens of a bribery scheme is now being prosecuted for perjury), Trump's party has repeatedly politicized the legal problems of Hunter Biden, who is also facing a second trial in a California court involving tax crimes.\n\nMonday's trial begins with jury selection and is expected to last about two weeks. For the president, it is a political and personal blow. Despite the possible cost at the polls, Joe Biden continues to support his son and makes public appearances with him constantly, including this past weekend.\n\nAfter years of being investigated by a prosecutor appointed by Donald Trump, David Weiss, Hunter Biden initially admitted to the illegal purchase and possession of the firearm as part of a plea deal with prosecutors that involved lesser penalties for the tax crimes and shelving the firearm case. In exchange, he had to stay away from drugs for two years and give up having a firearm in the future.\n\nIt is a common deal in cases in which the accused has undergone rehabilitation and has no prior criminal record. The plea deal, however, was derailed at the last minute. Judge Maryellen Noreika, appointed by Trump, rejected it due to the different interpretation between the prosecution and the defense, as well as pressure from the Republicans. Attorney General Merrick Garland gave special counsel powers to Weiss, who ultimately decided to press charges.\n\nThe crimes of which Hunter Biden is accused carry maximum sentences of up to 25 years in prison and fines of up to $750,000, but it is not common for sentences as high as this to be imposed in such a case. At the first hearing of the case, the judge highlighted their nature as \"maximum penalties\": a higher one cannot be imposed, but a lower one can.\n\nTo achieve a conviction on the two gun-related charges, prosecutors must convince the 12 jurors, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Hunter Biden knowingly made false statements to a federally licensed gun dealer and on his federal firearms application, and that the lie was relevant for the sale to be closed. For the weapon possession charge, they must prove that Biden was aware that he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance and still knowingly possessed a firearm.\n\nOn October 12, 2018, Hunter Biden walked into the StarQuest Shooters & Survival Supply, a firearms store off Highway 202, north of Wilmington, Delaware. Their display cases are filled with pistols, rifles and semi-automatic rifles. Joe Biden's son decided to buy a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver, caliber 38. To do so, he filled out Form 4473, an application with several pages of small print. Question 11.e asked him to answer whether he was an illegal user or addict of any stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance. Hunter Biden checked the No box. A footnote warned that he was prohibited from purchasing a gun if he marked yes, and that making a false statement in this regard was a crime. Hunter Biden purchased the revolver. The gun ended up 11 days later in a trash can at a Greenville supermarket, about a 10-minute drive from the gun store.\n\nThe president's son acknowledged in his memoirs that he was struggling with a crack addiction at the time, but his lawyers maintain that he did not break the law and that any other non-violent criminal with no prior record would not have been charged. Biden's defense has claimed that he had completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and may have believed he was clean when he checked the No box on the form.\n\nThe prosecution is considering calling Hunter Biden's ex-wife and the widow of his brother Beau Biden, with whom he later had a relationship, as witnesses to testify about his addiction. The defense will try to discredit the prosecution's evidence. Interestingly, like Trump, Hunter Biden maintains that he is the target of political persecution. The defendant alleged that he had been selectively accused for political purposes because he is the son of the president, who is also a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections on November 5. The judge rejected that argument and refused to shelve the case.", "source": {"uri": "english.elpais.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EL PA\u00cdS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "miguel_jimenez@english.elpais.com", "name": "Miguel Jim\u00e9nez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1972 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Caleb_Boggs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

During that period, prosecutors allege he lied about his substance abuse on a federal form to illegally purchase a firearm.\n\nSpecial Counsel David Weiss has indicated he plans to raise painful events from the Biden family's past related to Hunter's conduct and events that involve the president. Still, White House officials largely view the trial as a private matter for Biden's son tied to his personal behavior from years ago.\n\nThe president, who is expected to travel to France during part of the trial, will be monitoring it primarily as a concerned parent who has supported his son's recovery from addiction, according to a person familiar with his thinking.\n\nThere are no plans for the White House to publicly engage with the trial, said the person, who requested anonymity to discuss how the president and his staff view the legal matter. But those plans could change, and the person did not rule out the possibility of the president reacting to developments in real time.\n\nPlea Possibility\n\nWhile the possibility exists for a last-minute plea deal between the two sides, Hunter Biden's legal team is prepared to argue the charges are unconstitutional and violate the Second Amendment, as well as point out flaws in the government's evidence.\n\nDick Harpootlian, a Biden ally and former South Carolina prosecutor, said jurors in Biden's home state might wonder why prosecutors brought the criminal case against him now that he's shaken his drug addiction.\n\n\"It only takes one for a hung jury, and I can definitely see one or more jurors questioning the propriety of bringing this case,\" said Harpootlian, who now serves as a state senator.\n\nBiden's trial represents another highly politicized spectacle following the former President Trump's criminal trial in New York, which ended Thursday with his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up an affair with a porn star during the 2016 race.\n\nHunter Biden also has been charged by Weiss in Los Angeles for nine federal tax violations and is scheduled to go on trial in that case in September.\n\nThe gun trial is expected to be short but dramatic, with prosecutors airing details about Hunter Biden's drug-laden years that include excerpts from a book he wrote about it, Beautiful Things: A Memoir.\n\n\"His book is replete with admissions that establish he knew he was an addict and knew he was using crack cocaine throughout 2018, including in October 2018 when he purchased and possessed the gun,\" prosecutors wrote in a May 20 trial brief.\n\nFordham University law professor Cheryl Bader, an ex-assistant US attorney who now runs the school's criminal-law clinic, said Biden's chances of winning an acquittal are slim given his acknowledgment in his memoir.\n\nBiden has been open about his struggles with alcohol and drugs but said he has remained sober since mid-2019.\n\nFederal prosecutors \"only bring cases that they are confident they can win, and they are known for dotting their I's and crossing their T's,\" Bader said.\n\nTwo of the gun counts carry maximum prison time of 10 years; another is punishable by as much as five years. However, judges rarely impose maximum sentences.\n\nBiden's lawyers plan to challenge the government's charge that he bought the gun while a drug addict as constitutionally vague. They are set to argue that he wasn't using drugs when he bought the gun. They also plan to contend that the seller didn't comply with legal requirements in the gun sale and documentation.\n\n\"Intoxication from too much alcohol or using drugs, legal or illegal, may make it too dangerous for people to drive a car, operate heavy machinery, or possess a firearm one day, but they may be perfectly sober enough to do all those things the next day,\" according to a May 23 trial brief by Biden's lawyers.\n\nWeiss was nominated by Trump to serve as the US attorney for Delaware and kept on by Biden. He was appointed as a special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2023 to manage the cases against Hunter Biden.\n\nBiden and Weiss had agreed to a plea deal last year to resolve both allegations, but the agreement fell apart under questioning by the federal judge overseeing the case. Biden's lawyers and supporters have argued that Weiss then bowed to political pressure by Trump and conservatives in bringing the charges.\n\nThe gun case is US v.

As CNN reported, he faces two charges of lying on federal forms in 2018, in which he swore he was not addicted to drugs in order to buy a gun, and one count of illegally possessing the gun he purchased.\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" Biden said in the statement. \"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean.\n\n\"As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases [italics added], but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\n\n\"Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\"\n\nNote the subtle difference -- but a direct contradiction to what Biden told Ruhle last year.\n\nNow, Biden is claiming he can't comment on a federal case, but he had no problem doing it before -- issuing a blanket (and laughably deceptive) statement that his son had done \"nothing wrong.\" (It's worth noting that Biden didn't repeat that claim Monday. He probably realizes it would only antagonize potential jurors.)\n\nIt's true that Hunter Biden was not under indictment when Biden spoke to Ruhle, but he was under a federal investigation that was widely known. And the president was making his feelings known to his underlings as obviously as if he had written a memo from the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.\n\nNow that that effort to abuse the powers of his office has failed to end his son's legal liabilities, Biden is turning to the heartstrings defense.\n\nIs there a doubt in the world that any American jury, in any state, would not be aware of the words the president has said about a case? If there is, there's no doubt at all that a jury in Wilmington, Delaware, would know about them.\n\nDelaware is the state Biden represented in the Senate for 35 years, the state he returns home to frequently.\n\nNow, he's playing the heartbroken father card, the struggling addict card -- just about anything to distract voters from the fact that the criminal charges his son is facing are just a minuscule part of Hunter's years of crime -- when he earned millions of dollars for doing nothing more than peddling the Biden name.\n\nThe evidence that Hunter Biden was using drugs at the time of the gun purchase is available not only from witnesses who knew him intimately, such as his deceased brother's widow, who was Hunter's lover in 2018, but from Hunter Biden's autobiography, which is chockablock with drug use in his life, including around the time in question.\n\nIn October 2022, the U.K.'s Daily Mail carried a report about a recording of Joe Biden himself pleading with Hunter Biden to get help with his drug addiction, three days after the Hunter Biden purchased the gun. The recording, naturally, was reportedly found on Hunter Biden's infamous laptop.\n\nCan the president's transparent bid for sympathy overcome the mountain of evidence that Hunter Biden is guilty of lying on a federal form to purchase a gun -- a crime other defendants have gone to prison for?\n\nThat remains to be seen. But there's no doubt the White House spin machine is already working on it.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

trial Monday on gun charges, the first prosecution in U.S. history for the child of a sitting president -- just as the Democratic leader is seeking to accelerate his campaign for reelection.\n\nThe 54-year-old denies three felony counts stemming from his purchase of a .38-caliber Colt Cobra revolver in 2018 when, by his own admission, he was heavily addicted to drugs.\n\nThe Yale-trained lawyer and lobbyist-turned-artist has been plagued by legal troubles and controversies that have been a drag on his father's campaign, mostly connected to alcoholism and crack cocaine addiction.\n\nIn the latest chapter in his troubled life, Hunter Biden will be tried in the family's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, on two counts of making false statements on paperwork for the gun purchase that he was not using drugs illegally.\n\nHe faces a third charge that he illegally possessed the gun -- which he had for only 11 days in October 2018.\n\nThe prosecution is a public relations test for the Democrats, coming just days after another historic event -- Republican White House nominee Donald Trump becoming the first former U.S. president to be criminally convicted.\n\nBiden campaign aides face the challenge of ensuring that daily responses to journalists' questions about the trial do not force Trump's own legal battles out of the headlines.\n\nIf found guilty, Hunter Biden could in theory face 25 years in prison, though in practice such offenses, if not accompanied by other charges, are seldom punished by jail time.\n\nJurors will hear about the defendant's excessive drug use as prosecutors run through the series of events that led to him buying the firearm in Delaware before it was thrown into a grocery store trash can by his girlfriend.\n\nThe younger Biden, who says he has been sober since 2019, chronicled his longtime struggles with drug addiction in his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things\" -- writing in one eye-watering extract that he was \"smoking crack every 15 minutes.\"\n\nThe book is almost certain to be brought up at trial, with prosecutors expected to lean in on sections in which Biden describes being an addict for four years up to March 2019.\n\nThe defense team has pushed for narrow definitions of the terms \"addict\" and \"user\" and requested instructions requiring an acquittal if the jury determines that the defendant did not consider himself to fit those definitions.\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" his lawyer Abbe Lowell wrote in court documents.\n\n\"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nThe case comes with Republicans pursuing an impeachment inquiry in Congress into what they claim is a Biden family criminal conspiracy, although they have provided no evidence that the president did anything wrong.\n\nRepublican politicians have accused Hunter Biden of engaging in corrupt business practices in China and Ukraine but he has not been charged with any crimes related to his foreign business dealings.\n\nThe president has repeatedly said he stands by his son and loves him for his attempts to recover from drug addiction, while the White House has not commented on the investigation itself.\n\nProsecutors have said they expect to take three days to present their case, and the entire trial will likely last about two weeks.\n\nHunter Biden faces separate tax evasion charges in his home state of California, in a case set to go to trial later in the year.", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Raw Story"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Biden of engaging in corrupt business practices in China and Ukraine, but he has not been charged with any crimes related to his foreign dealings.\n\nThe president has said he stands by his son and

He is also charged with illegal possession of the firearm, which he had for just 11 days in October of that year.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty. He had earlier reached a plea deal with prosecutors but this collapsed, leading to the trial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProsecutors are set to introduce voluminous evidence linked to Hunter Biden's years as an addict.\n\nThey have called as witnesses three of his former partners, including Lunden Roberts, the mother of one of his children.\n\nThe president's son, who has written unsparingly about his addiction, will contend that at the moment he bought the revolver, he did not consider himself to be an addict. He has stated that he has been sober since 2019.\n\nIf found guilty, Hunter Biden could face 25 years in prison, although as a first-time offender he could get a far lighter sentence or escape any jail time. He could also face fines of up to $750,000.\n\nPresident Biden said today that his son's difficulties would resonate widely.\n\n\"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\" he said.\n\nHunter Biden has long been the target of Trump and hard-right Republicans, amplified by exhaustive coverage on Fox News.\n\nLurid photos from his time as an addict have been leaked and Trump allies have investigated him at length in Congress on allegations of corruption and influence-peddling. However, no charges have ever been brought.\n\nHunter Biden's messy private life and controversial foreign business dealings in China and Ukraine have also formed the basis for attempts by Republicans in Congress to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Biden. Those efforts too have gone nowhere.\n\nThe White House said last year that there would be no presidential pardon for Hunter Biden in case of a conviction.\n\nDemocratic congressman Adam Schiff, a Biden ally, told CNN Sunday that Americans should \"absolutely\" respect the jury's verdict.\n\n\"I think the president himself will respect the verdict -- much as it is painful, I'm sure, to see one of your children on trial.\"\n\n\u00a9 AFP 2024", "source": {"uri": "thejournal.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheJournal.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@thejournal.ie", "name":

Hunter Biden, an admitted drug addict, bought a gun in Delaware and lied on his 4473 form (which attests that he has the legal right to buy a gun) about his drug use. His girlfriend at the time and his late brother's widow, Hallie Biden, dumped the gun in a garbage can at a grocery store across the street from a high school. When Hunter discovered what Hallie had done, the gun was already missing. The Secret Service then tried to seize the original transaction records from the gun store, but the store refused to hand them over. After all, why would the Secret Service need the gun purchase records of then then-former Vice President's son?\n\nEventually, the issue of lying on his 4473 form was rolled up into a \"sweetheart deal\" for Hunter Biden, conveniently folded in with his tax charges, and he was going to plead guilty and walk away. That deal blew up when Judge Maryellen Noreika began poking holes in the entire thing, and ended with Hunter Biden facing federal gun charges in Delaware, and separate felony tax charges in California. The California tax trial has now been delayed to September, but the trial on the gun charges, despite Hunter's legal team's best pleadings, complaints, and wacky persecution theories (which cost his \"sugar brother\" Kevin Morris a whole lot of cash), begins today.\n\nAnd it begins under the shadow of some shady shenanigans being pulled by none other than Joe Biden himself. Imagine, if you will, that Donald Trump visited his former daughter-in-law right before she was supposed to testify against one of the Trump sons. The media would be howling in outrage, right? Well...\n\nPresident Joe Biden visited the home of Hallie Biden days before she is due to testify in his first son Hunter Biden's gun trial, raising eyebrows about the purpose of his visit.\n\nThe White House says the visit was about the ninth anniversary of the death of Beau Biden, the president's first son to whom Hallie was married. However, the president's brief visit with Hallie also comes before she is expected to testify as a witness in Hunter Biden's gun crime trial next month.\n\nHallie dated Hunter at the time of his alleged gun crimes and is one of a dozen expected witnesses, according to Fox News.\n\nLet me just make this point again, for the people in the back. Hallie Biden was not just \"dating Hunter at the time of his alleged gun crimes.\" HALLIE BIDEN IS THE DUMBASS WHO DECIDED TO THROW A GUN AWAY IN A GARBAGE CAN. She should be facing charges of her own, but we don't live in a country with a justice system willing to charge the president's favorite son's widow with a crime. What we DO have is the sitting president of the United States, visiting a material witness to his son's drug use and possession of a firearm, just days before she is supposed to testify. I don't think Joe was simply paying a condolence call over Beau, though that is his favorite subject in the world. I can easily imagine that conversation going along the lines of \"remember that you're the one who threw the gun away, Hallie, and you're planning on remarrying and your children are legal adults now... and I don't want Hunter going to jail, no joke.\"\n\nAnd not to put too fine a point on it, but Joe is keeping Hunter on a short leash near him right now.\n\nNot only that, Joe changed his schedule to be nearby in Delaware before heading off for campaign events. A no-fly zone has been announced around Wilmington, and Joe Biden's schedule now reflects that he will be near Beau this morning.\n\nWell, before Hunter Biden even sets foot in the courtroom, his legal team is already facing massive problems. Not only do we know that there was cocaine residue on the gun pouch, and not only does Hunter's own memoir detail his drug use during this period of time where he was buying the gun, all of the novel legal theories that his team has been trying to come up with are getting shot down (pun intended). You see, Hunter's lawyers were going to argue that when he bought the gun in 2018, he was NOT an \"addict.\"\n\n\"I'm... an alcoholic and a drug addict,\" Hunter Biden says in the prologue to his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" written following four years of extreme drug abuse. Writing in USA TODAY last December, Biden, 54, decried the \"weaponization of my addiction by partisan and craven factions.\"\n\nToday, Biden refers to himself as an addict in recovery. But there was a moment in 2018 when Biden was not an addict, his lawyers say. It was on Oct. 12, when he purchased a Colt .38 Special revolver and checked \"No\" on a federal gun form that asked: \"Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?\"\n\nIn the fall of 2018, Hunter Biden moved back to the East Coast after months of despairing drug abuse in California. At one point that summer, his uncle, James Biden, had hauled him out of a hotel room and placed him in a rehab center before he moved in with a sobriety coach in the hills over Los Angeles.\n\n\"It was great - the beauty, the peace, the support - right up until the moment I relapsed,\" he writes in \"Beautiful Things. \"My lesson after a spring and summer of nonstop debauchery: no lesson at all.\"\n\nBut it was during one of those periods of sobriety that Hunter Biden purchased the handgun and answered honestly on the federal paperwork, his lawyers say.\n\n\"At issue here is Mr. Biden's understanding of the question,\" his lawyer Abbe Lowell recently wrote the court. \"Someone like Mr. Biden, who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nBiden's lawyers haven't specified where and when the 11-day rehab took place, but they are emphatic that Biden could have reasonably considered himself sober as a result of it.\n\nSo, the very expensive lawyer Abbe Lowell, and the very expensive legal team that Kevin Morris has been paying for, was going to try and claim that because Hunter Biden didn't cut himself a line of cocaine on the counter of the gun store and snort it right then and there, HE WAS SOBER and THEREFORE, not an addict. If this is giving you Bill Clinton vibes, welcome to the club. And that \"sober companion\" that Hunter Biden was living with? If that is Hallie Biden, then the defense is in deep trouble, because Hallie threw the gun out because... wait for it... Hunter was using drugs.\n\nHallie Biden awoke on an October morning in 2018 after Hunter Biden, the brother of her deceased husband, Beau, had spent the night. While he slept, she dropped her two kids off at school and then returned to rummage through the truck he had parked outside, anxious as to what the admitted drug addict might be hiding.\n\nWhen she found a newly purchased Colt Cobra .38 handgun, she was hit by a wave of anger and fear. She put the gun in a shopping bag and drove a few miles to a high-end grocery store, where she tossed it into a trash can. That set off a chain of events that would trigger a flurry of frantic text messages, launch another dark chapter in a doomed and difficult romance -- and lead to Hunter Biden's federal trial beginning Monday.\n\nThose text messages, which will be used as evidence at trial, have Hallie begging Hunter to check himself into a rehab clinic.\n\nLet's just say that Judge Noreika is not buying the \"what is the definition of an addict\" argument, because she just blocked the testimony of an \"expert witness\" that Hunter's legal team wanted to use.\n\nNoreika granted a request from special counsel David Weiss to block one of Hunter Biden's expert witnesses from testifying. The defense had lined up a Columbia University-based psychiatrist who would've tried to poke holes in prosecutors' assertions that Hunter Biden knew he was an addict in 2018 when he bought the gun that led to his indictment.\n\n\"The inadequacy of Defendant's expert disclosure for Dr. (Elie) Aoun leaves the government in the dark as to what his opinions about the facts of this case will be, thus rendering the government unable to prepare for trial,\" Noreika wrote in her ruling.\n\nThe judge also ruled that only the original 4473 form will be introduced at trial. An annotated version of Form 4473 was made by the shop years after the purchase, seemingly so the store could cover their butt.\n\nA shop employee created the original document when Hunter Biden purchased the firearm in 2018. It lists Biden's passport as the ID he presented to the shop employee.\n\nYears later, however, a copy was made. The copy included a handwritten note, \"DE Vehicle Registration,\" on a line left blank for \"Supplemental Government Issued Documentation.\" Store employees did so in 2021 to rectify a requirement that gun buyers present a form of ID that includes an address, which passports do not.\n\nLowell contends that gun store employees \"tampered with\" the document, and that it raises questions about \"who wrote what on the form, and when.\"\n\nWeiss' office has said the gun shop employees merely \"annotated\" the document. But they took Lowell's argument seriously enough to re-interview the gun store owner, Ronald Palimere, on May 16.\n\nDuring the interview, according to notes filed on the case docket, Palimere said Hunter Biden's legal tribulations were becoming \"a big scandal and there was intense attention on the incident,\" and that employees at the store \"were all scared to death.\"\n\nPalimere \"felt it was necessary to annotate the Form 4473 because he felt they were going to get in trouble just for going up against Biden,\" according to the notes.\n\nYou can really tell the judge is out of patience with Lowell.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers recently argued in court that they wanted to use the doctored form to undermine the credibility of the employees, who are slated to testify on behalf of the prosecutors. They also claimed it showed prosecutors were politically \"biased.\"\n\nBut Noreika ruled the altered version of the form was \"irrelevant and inadmissible,\" and she went on to blast Hunter Biden's team for pushing \"conspiratorial\" theories and \"unsupported rhetoric\" about the motivations of the Wilmington gun store employees.\n\n\"Any probative value it arguably has is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, and misleading the jury,\" she wrote, further adding that any attempts by the defense to use the altered form to demonstrate the employees' alleged political bias would have been \"unduly prejudicial and invites (jury) nullification.\"\n\nAs we just learned when watching a different trial last week, the judge and the jury are what makes or breaks these cases. Is a jury in Delaware likely to be too much in awe of the Bidens to ever convict Hunter? It seems that Judge Noreika certainly is not. Is Joe going to be sitting in the courtroom for a few hours, just to make an impression on potential jurors? But Hunter is not Joe, and Hunter comes with a laundry list of his own problems that have landed him in this courtroom. We also now know that Hunter has other money problems than just his \"sugar brother\" being tapped out. He owes quite a lot of alimony to his ex-wife. The mother of his daughter in Arkansas is planning on publishing a book about their relationship - is Hunter keeping up on his child support payments, or if he's still trying to pay his daughter in finger paintings?\n\nOne gets the feeling that the Biden family gravy train is heading off into the sunset. The next generation will have to get real jobs, because Hunter Biden will have spent everything left in legal fees and court-ordered payments. After years of protecting Hunter, Joe's ability to save him might be coming to a crashing end.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors":

The culmination of a sprawling investigation, the deal between Hunter Biden and prosecutors was going to spare him a politically explosive trial in the middle of his father's reelection campaign and likely prison time.\n\nBut it all fell apart.\n\nNow, Hunter Biden is headed to trial on federal gun charges in a case brought by his father's Justice Department at a time when America's political and legal worlds are colliding like never before. Dogged for years by investigations, scrutinized over his troubled personal life and vilified by Republicans, the younger Biden is now also confronting the threat of felony convictions and time behind bars.\n\nThe case opening Monday with jury selection in Delaware is not about Hunter Biden's business dealings, which have been the focus of the yearslong federal investigation and Republicans' fruitless impeachment inquiry into the Democratic president. It's about a gun Hunter Biden had for about 11 days -- a .38-caliber Colt Cobra Special. Prosecutors say he bought it illegally in October 2018 because he falsely swore on a federal form that he was not a drug user. He never fired the gun, according to his lawyers, and it ended up dumped in a trash can.........................\n\n........................\n\nJurors are expected to hear testimony from his ex-wife and other former romantic partners, including Beau's widow, Hallie Biden, with whom Hunter Biden had a relationship after his brother's death. Hallie Biden found the gun in Hunter Biden's truck and threw it in a trash. It was found by a man collecting recyclables who gave it to the police......................\n\n...................................\n\n................................", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_inquiry_against_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_Cobra", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colt Cobra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.38_Special", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": ".38 Special"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Airsoft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Airsoft", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-", "textStart": 1597, "textEnd": 1609}], "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Instead, Hunter Biden was seen at the White House and in Delaware at his father's side amid what the president's allies acknowledge is a difficult moment for both men.\n\nThey attended a White House state dinner for Kenya last month; marked the ninth anniversary of the death of Beau Biden, the president's eldest son, at church last week; and cycled together along a trail in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on Saturday.\n\nThe president also planned to spend most of Monday in Wilmington, where jury selection for the trial - the first of a sitting US president's child - is set to get underway. He traveled there Sunday evening, arriving earlier than originally planned.\n\nHunter Biden, 54, is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He pleaded not guilty to the three charges, though he has been open about his struggles with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction.\n\nFor the president, the legal problems facing his son have been reason to pull him close, rather than push him away. Joe Biden has paid little mind to some of his allies who question the approach. Instead, his concern for his son's well-being surpasses any potential political fallout, advisers have said.\n\nThat concern has appeared at moments to be all-consuming, including in the darkest moments of Hunter Biden's addiction, when the president and his family desperately sought to head off a self-destructive cycle.\n\nJoe Biden still speaks with or texts with his son almost daily, particularly as his legal issues mounted.\n\nThe president told an interviewer last year his son had done \"nothing wrong,\" and that the only way Hunter Biden's legal issues were affecting his presidency was in creating a surge of fatherly pride.\n\n\"It impacts my presidency by making me feel proud of him,\" he said on MSNBC.\n\nAs the gun trial gets underway, Biden will be heading overseas to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day. There is little question he will remain in regular touch with his son while abroad and will keep abreast of the trial amid a heavy schedule of commemorations, speeches and a state visit in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nBut neither he nor the White House is expected to speak proactively about the trial. Hunter Biden's legal team generally operates separately from the president and his campaign, and there are few who believe there would be much benefit in the president weighing in publicly.\n\nProsecutors have said they plan to call about a dozen witnesses for their case.\n\nMost notably, they've lined up testimony from three of Hunter Biden's former romantic partners to testify about his drug use around the time he bought the gun. This includes his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle; his late brother's widow, Hallie Biden, whom Hunter Biden later dated; and Lunden Roberts, the mother of one of his children.\n\nTheir testimony could bring to life a period that Hunter Biden has described as his rock bottom, during which he was almost always on drugs or trying to get drugs. At his attempted plea hearing last year, Hunter Biden testified that he has been sober since May 2019.\n\nThere was a time last summer when the president and his orbit believed Hunter Biden's legal ordeal would end with a plea deal and that the family would be able to close a dark chapter.\n\nThose hopes were dashed when the agreement fell apart and, weeks later, a special counsel was appointed to oversee the investigation into the president's son, opening the prospect of prolonged legal battles overlapping with Joe Biden's run for reelection.\n\nBut many in Biden's orbit suggest his son's legal issues will not be a driving concern for voters heading into November's election.\n\nStill, few issues are more sensitive inside the Biden White House than the president's son, from his addiction battles to his legal woes.\n\nThat has largely left Hunter Biden and his team to go on their own offense, accusing Republicans and others of trying to use his addiction issues for political profit.\n\n\"They are trying to, in their most illegitimate way, but rational way, they're trying to destroy a presidency,\" Hunter Biden said in a podcast released late last year. \"And so, it's not about me, and ... what they're trying to do is they're trying to kill me, knowing that it will be a pain greater than my father could be able to handle and so therefore destroying a presidency in that way.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_liptak@cnn.com", "name": "Kevin Liptak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts":

Hunter Biden is facing three criminal counts of buying a gun while being addicted to crack-cocaine and lying about it on an official form. Three of Hunter Biden's exes, including his brother Beau's widow (who Hunter also dated), may be called to testify.

According to reporters on the scene, Hunter Biden joked that he got her a \"special event\" for her birthday when he greeted her.\n\nBiden aides have continued to be worried how the trial of his son would impact the president emotionally and mentally.

The two criminal cases are not related, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken centre stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $US1.4 million ($A2.1 million) in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a years-long investigation into his business dealings.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs - which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show he was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun - and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence Hunter Biden's published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos where he's often nude and doing drugs and highly personal messages where he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period where, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother Beau Biden from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018, and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his lawyers have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They will also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails", "source": {"uri": "thewest.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The West Australian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2024_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organization_for_Women", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Organization for Women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beau Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-14891036/0178e73c1f882750dbfef27e154a0ebd466785e1-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-", "textStart": 3098, "textEnd": 3110}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The son of a sitting president has never before faced a criminal trial.\n\nMORE: As Hunter Biden goes to trial on gun charges, here's how his attorneys plan to defend a 'simple case'\n\nThe trial comes on the heels of former President Donald Trump's conviction on felony charges related to a 2016 hush money payment made to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said in a statement issued this morning that he has \"boundless love\" for his son.\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us,\" Biden said in the statement as jury selection got underway.\n\n\"A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\" the president said.\n\n\"As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength,\" he said. \"Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\"\n\nAfter filling out the jury questionnaire, the first panel of prospective jurors are being brought into the court room one-by-one to face individual questioning from the judge and both parties. As of about 9:45 a.m. ET, the court had made it through the questioning of just six jurors.\n\nThe prospective jurors so far have include a woman who worked with the Secret Service for over two decades and whose husband was a uniformed officer in Washington, D.C., at locations including the White House.\n\nOne prospective juror who volunteered for Hilary Clinton's 2008 campaign prompted the first mention of President Joe Biden -- though not by name.\n\nJudge Norieka asked that prospective juror if her work volunteering and donating to Democratic campaigns would prevent her from being fair in a case that involved \"the son of the Democratic president of the United States.\"\n\nShe said it would not.\n\nThe exchange occurred as first lady Jill Biden sat in the front row of the gallery, watching intently as each juror answered their questions. The first lady is sitting next to Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa.\n\nEarlier, a prospective juror was struck for cause because of his firm views on guns, after he told the judge he thought gun ownership was a \"God-given right.\" He said he would not be able to be impartial in a case where someone was prevented from buying a gun due to federal law.\n\nHunter Biden's arrival through the front entrance of the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building this morning means he would have passed an enormous portrait of his father, which hangs in every federal courthouse in the country.\n\nThe first batch of 50 jurors were sworn in by Judge Noreika, who instructed them not to discuss the case with anyone, including family, or to conduct any research on the case or to read any news about it.\n\nReporters monitoring the proceedings from the overflow room could not hear most of Noreika's statement due to technical difficulties. As technicians tried to fix the issue, they turned on a TV that happened to be playing an attack ad against Joe Biden.\n\nHunter Biden has arrived at the courthouse for the start of his federal gun trial this morning.\n\nHis stepmother, first lady Jill Biden, is attending the proceedings.\n\nTwo hundred and fifty Delaware residents have been summoned to the courthouse in downtown Wilmington, where they will face typical questions about their fitness to serve as jurors.\n\nBut because this is the trial of the son of a sitting president, there will be some novel topics covered during the jury selection process known as \"voir dire.\"\n\nAmong the questions jurors will be asked: \"If you were eligible to vote in any election(s) in which Joseph R. Biden was a candidate, would that fact prevent you from maintaining an open, impartial mind until all of the evidence is presented, and the instructions of the Court are given?\"\n\nAnd \"Do you believe Robert Hunter Biden is being prosecuted in this case because his father is the President of the United States and a candidate for President?\"\n\nOn the eve of trial, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika threw a wrench in one of the key arguments attorneys for Hunter Biden were planning to advance, ruling that an annotated copy of the federal form Hunter Biden is accused of lying on would be excluded from evidence.\n\nThe original document, called an ATF Form 4473, was created in 2018 when Hunter Biden purchased the firearm. But in 2021, gun store employees made a copy that included some handwritten notes. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell contended that employees had \"tampered with\" the document, and that it raised questions about \"who wrote what on the form, and when.\"\n\nLowell hoped his argument would undermine the credibility of some key government witnesses -- the people who sold Biden the gun -- and potentially create a reasonable doubt that Hunter Biden was the one who actually checked that box.\n\nAttorneys for special counsel David Weiss' office have said the gun shop employees merely \"annotated\" the form and urged Noreika to prevent Lowell from introducing it into evidence.\n\nJury selection is scheduled to get underway today in the federal gun trial of Hunter Biden, who authorities say broke the law when he purchased a Colt revolver in 2018.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's son faces two counts of making false statements while purchasing the firearm and a third count of illegally obtaining it while addicted to drugs.\n\nAlthough the charges together carry a possible sentence of up to 25 years, legal experts say that, as a first-time and nonviolent offender, Hunter Biden would not likely serve time if convicted.\n\nThe trial, in Delaware federal court, is expected to last two to three weeks.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2008 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Caleb_Boggs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

He has pleaded not guilty to the three charges.\n\nIt marks the latest court appearance for President Joe Biden's son and the first since Biden's opponent in this year's presidential election, Donald Trump, was found guilty of falsifying business documents to illegally influence the 2016 presidential election through hush-money payments made to an adult film star.\n\nHunter Biden's high-profile case sets the stage for a trial his defense team attempted to avoid entirely.\n\nIn July, Biden, 54, had a tentative deal with prosecutors where he'd plead guilty to separate tax charges and enter into a diversion agreement on the gun offenses to avoid trial. But things fell apart during a hearing with U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who raised concerns over the deal's terms.\n\nFrom there, Justice Department special counsel David Weiss was appointed to the case and brought new gun-related charges. Biden's attorney, Abbe Lowell, has tried to get the case dismissed on various grounds without success. Lowell has said the gun charges are being handled atypically and suggested it's because of Republican pressure.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nA five-year investigation into Biden's taxes and foreign business dealings examined his role in his board position with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. Trump's attempts to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens and Hunter's involvement with Burisma led to the former president's first impeachment.\n\nThe Senate Republicans' investigation into Biden's board position floated conflict-of-interest concerns but concluded that it was \"not clear\" how his role \"affected U.S. policy toward Ukraine.\"\n\nProsecutors ultimately closed in on two issues: Biden's failure to pay income taxes on time and lying about his substance abuse on a firearm application.\n\nBiden has been open about his struggles with substance abuse, leading prosecutors to allege that he was lying on his application.\n\nIn his memoir, Beautiful Things, Biden talks about addiction. He wrote that he first bought crack cocaine when he was 18 and started drinking while in high school.\n\nHe has been in and out of rehab multiple times and held long stints of sobriety between relapses. In Beautiful Things, Biden said his addictions took a dark turn following the death of his older brother, Beau, from brain cancer in 2015\n\nIn October 2020, a month before the election, the New York Post reported that it had received a copy of a hard drive from a laptop Hunter Biden used from Trump's personal attorney at the time, Rudy Giuliani. The story alleged that the laptop showed international corruption from Hunter Biden and his father.\n\n\"Hunter Biden's laptop\" became a pressure point among far-right Republicans. But the story was met with skepticism by others because of the laptop's unknown origins and Giuliani's involvement.\n\nThe latest indictment came after Biden's plea deal on tax and gun charges fell apart after facing scrutiny from Noreika. That agreement would have let Biden plead guilty for two tax-related misdemeanors and enter a pretrial program for the gun charge that could've resulted in its eventual dismissal and potentially avoiding prison time.\n\nNoreika said she wouldn't accept the deal, citing disputes between the prosecutors and defense about whether the deal protected Biden from future charges.\n\nBiden will also face a second prosecution on tax charges, which is scheduled for trial in September in California.\n\nThe president has been careful not to weigh in on his son's case aside from expressing love and support.\n\n\"As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases,\" Joe Biden said in a statement Monday. \"But as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden; Hunter's wife, Melissa Cohen Biden; and his sister, Ashley Biden, are supporting Hunter Biden in court on Monday. Joe Biden will not be in attendance but changed his schedule to be in Wilmington.\n\nIt'll depend on what happens in this trial.\n\nIf Biden is convicted in the gun case, a sentencing hearing would come next. A judge could impose a penalty ranging from probation to years in prison. The maximum sentence for these charges would be 25 years, but the Justice Department has noted most sentences fall below the top penalties.\n\nIf he is acquitted, his team will turn their sights to his upcoming tax trial.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_bloch@inquirer.com", "name": "Emily Bloch", "type":

for helping him get sober.\n\nMelissa walked hand-in-hand with Hunter into court Monday morning.\n\nSister Ashley was also on hand, as well as Naomi Biden's husband Peter Neal.\n\nThe president remained in Wilmington - and will fly to Connecticut for a fundraiser later Monday - but did not show up at the courthouse with other family members.\n\n'As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength,' Biden continued.\n\n'Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our live and support.'\n\nHunter's addiction spiraled out of control after the 2015 death of his brother Beau Biden to brain

Things.\n\nThe younger Biden stands accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants whe he said he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHunter has pleaded not guilty.\n\nHe said he is being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans complained about a 'sweetheart' plea deal that the first son had entered into - a deal that fell apart last summer.\n\nHunter was indicted on gun charges in September.\n\nThe case directly follows the dramatic conclusion to former President Donald Trump's hush money case, in which the former president was indicted Thursday on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to hide payments to porn star Stormy Daniels.",

Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us,\" Biden said in the statement as jury selection got underway.\n\n\"A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\" the president said.\n\n\"As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength,\" he said. \"Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\"\n\nJun 03, 10:10 AM\n\nJurors face individual questioning as Jill Biden looks on\n\nAfter filling out the jury questionnaire, the first panel of prospective jurors are being brought into the court room one-by-one to face individual questioning from the judge and both parties. As of about 9:45 a.m. ET, the court had made it through the questioning of just six jurors.\n\nThe prospective jurors so far have include a woman who worked with the Secret Service for over two decades and whose husband was a uniformed officer in Washington, D.C., at locations including the White House.\n\nOne prospective juror who volunteered for Hilary Clinton's 2008 campaign prompted the first mention of President Joe Biden -- though not by name.\n\nJudge Norieka asked that prospective juror if her work volunteering and donating to Democratic campaigns would prevent her from being fair in a case that involved \"the son of the Democratic president of the United States.\"\n\nShe said it would not.\n\nThe exchange occurred as first lady Jill Biden sat in the front row of the gallery, watching intently as each juror answered their questions. The first lady is sitting next to Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa.\n\nEarlier, a prospective juror was struck for cause because of his firm views on guns, after he told the judge he thought gun ownership was a \"God-given right.\" He said he would not be able to be impartial in a case where someone was prevented from buying a gun due to federal law.\n\nJun 03, 9:39 AM\n\n1st batch of 50 jurors sworn in\n\nHunter Biden's arrival through the front entrance of the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building this morning means he would have passed an enormous portrait of his father, which hangs in every federal courthouse in the country.\n\nThe first batch of 50 jurors were sworn in by Judge Noreika, who instructed them not to discuss the case with anyone, including family, or to conduct any research on the case or to read any news about it.\n\nReporters monitoring the proceedings from the overflow room could not hear most of Noreika's statement due to technical difficulties. As technicians tried to fix the issue, they turned on a TV that happened to be playing an attack ad against Joe Biden.\n\nJun 03, 8:58 AM\n\nHunter Biden, first lady Jill Biden arrive at courthouse\n\nHunter Biden has arrived at the courthouse for the start of his federal gun trial this morning.\n\nHis mother, first lady Jill Biden, is also attending.\n\nJun 03, 7:46 AM\n\nProspective jurors will be asked about president\n\nTwo hundred and fifty Delaware residents have been summoned to the courthouse in downtown Wilmington, where they will face typical questions about their fitness to serve as jurors.\n\nBut because this is the trial of the son of a sitting president, there will be some novel topics covered during the jury selection process known as \"voir dire.\"\n\nAmong the questions jurors will be asked: \"If you were eligible to vote in any election(s) in which Joseph R. Biden was a candidate, would that fact prevent you from maintaining an open, impartial mind until all of the evidence is presented, and the instructions of the Court are given?\"\n\nAnd \"Do you believe Robert Hunter Biden is being prosecuted in this case because his father is the President of the United States and a candidate for President?\"\n\nJun 03, 7:20 AM\n\nJudge rules annotated form can't be used as evidence\n\nOn the eve of trial, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika threw a wrench in one of the key arguments attorneys for Hunter Biden were planning to advance, ruling that an annotated copy of the federal form Hunter Biden is accused of lying on would be excluded from evidence.\n\nThe original document, called an ATF Form 4473, was created in 2018 when Hunter Biden purchased the firearm. But in 2021, gun store employees made a copy that included some handwritten notes. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell contended that employees had \"tampered with\" the document, and that it raised questions about \"who wrote what on the form, and when.\"\n\nLowell hoped his argument would undermine the credibility of some key government witnesses -- the people who sold Biden the gun -- and potentially create a reasonable doubt that Hunter Biden was the one who actually checked that box.\n\nAttorneys for special counsel David Weiss' office have said the gun shop employees merely \"annotated\" the form and urged Noreika to prevent Lowell from introducing it into evidence.\n\nJury selection is scheduled to get underway today in the federal gun trial of Hunter Biden, who authorities say broke the law when he purchased a Colt revolver in 2018.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's son faces two counts of making false statements while purchasing the firearm and a third count of illegally obtaining it while addicted to drugs.\n\nAlthough the charges together carry a possible sentence of up to 25 years, legal experts say that, as a first-time and nonviolent offender, Hunter Biden would not likely serve time if convicted.\n\nThe trial, in Delaware federal court, is expected to last two to three weeks.", "source": {"uri": "weisradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WEIS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courthouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Courthouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2008 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Caleb_Boggs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Jury selection commenced on Monday, and the trial is anticipated to last one to two weeks.\n\nPresident Biden said he and the first lady, who was marking her 73rd birthday Monday, were \"so proud\" of Hunter Biden.\n\n\"As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nThe trial comes days after a jury in New York made history by finding Donald Trump guilty of business fraud, the first time a former president has ever been criminally convicted.\n\nTrump, who is running as the Republican challenger to Joe Biden in November, faces three other far more serious criminal cases, including his alleged attempt to overthrow the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe Delaware trial -- along with another in which Hunter Biden faces charges in California on tax evasion -- is an embarrassment for Joe Biden, as he seeks a second term and hopes to keep the country's focus on Trump's behaviour.\n\nIn addition to being a political distraction, Hunter Biden's legal woes will reopen painful emotional wounds for the family from his time as a drug addict -- a period that both he and his father have discussed publicly.\n\nHunter Biden's brother Beau died from cancer in 2015 and his sister Naomi died as an infant in a 1972 car crash.\n\nThe Yale-trained lawyer and lobbyist-turned-artist is charged with falsely stating on legal paperwork when buying a .38 calibre Colt Cobra revolver in 2018 that he was not using drugs illegally.\n\nHe is also charged with illegal possession of the firearm, which he had for just 11 days in October of that year.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty. He had earlier reached a plea deal with prosecutors, but this collapsed, leading to the trial.\n\nProsecutors are set to introduce voluminous -- and often uncomfortable -- evidence linked to Hunter Biden's years as an addict.\n\nThey have called as witnesses three of his former partners, including Lunden Roberts, the mother of one of his children.\n\nThe president's son, who has written unsparingly about his addiction, will contend that at the moment he bought the revolver, he did not consider himself to be an addict. He has stated that he has been sober since 2019.\n\nIf found guilty, Hunter Biden could face 25 years in prison, although as a first-time offender, he could get a far lighter sentence or escape any jail time. He could also face fines of up to $750,000.\n\nPresident Biden said on Monday that his son's difficulties would resonate widely.\n\n\"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\" he said.\n\nHunter Biden has long been the target of Trump and hard-right Republicans, amplified by exhaustive coverage on Fox News.\n\nLurid photos from his time as an addict have been leaked, and Trump allies have investigated him at length in Congress on allegations of corruption and influence-peddling. However, no charges have ever been brought.\n\nHunter Biden's messy private life and controversial foreign business dealings in China and Ukraine have also formed the basis for attempts by Republicans in Congress to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Biden. Those efforts, too, have gone nowhere.\n\nThe White House said last year that there would be no presidential pardon for Hunter Biden in the event of a conviction.\n\nDemocratic congressman Adam Schiff, a Biden ally, told CNN Sunday that Americans should \"absolutely\" respect the jury's verdict.\n\n\"I think the president himself will respect the verdict -- much as it is painful, I'm sure, to see one of your children on trial.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribuneonlineng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tribune Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sandra_nwaokolo@tribuneonlineng.com", "name":

The Yale-trained lawyer and lobbyist-turned-artist has been plagued by legal troubles and controversies that have been a drag on his father's campaign, mostly connected to alcoholism and crack cocaine addiction read more\n\nJoe Biden's son Hunter goes on trial Monday on gun charges, the first prosecution in US history for the child of a sitting president - just as the Democratic leader is seeking to accelerate his campaign for reelection.\n\nThe 54-year-old denies three felony counts stemming from his purchase of a .38-caliber Colt Cobra revolver in 2018 when, by his own admission, he was heavily addicted to drugs.\n\nThe Yale-trained lawyer and lobbyist-turned-artist has been plagued by legal troubles and controversies that have been a drag on his father's campaign, mostly connected to alcoholism and crack cocaine addiction.\n\nIn the latest chapter in his troubled life, Hunter Biden will be tried in the family's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, on two counts of making false statements on paperwork for the gun purchase that he was not using drugs illegally.\n\nHe faces a third charge that he illegally possessed the gun - which he had for only 11 days in October 2018.\n\nThe prosecution is a public relations test for the Democrats, coming just days after another historic event - Republican White House nominee Donald Trump becoming the first former US president to be criminally convicted.\n\n- 'Smoking crack' -\n\nBiden campaign aides face the challenge of ensuring that daily responses to journalists' questions about the trial do not force Trump's own legal battles out of the headlines.\n\nIf found guilty, Hunter Biden could in theory face 25 years in prison, though in practice such offenses, if not accompanied by other charges, are seldom punished by jail time.\n\nJurors will hear about the defendant's excessive drug use as prosecutors run through the series of events that led to him buying the firearm in Delaware before it was thrown into a grocery store trash can by his girlfriend.\n\nThe younger Biden, who says he has been sober since 2019, chronicled his longtime struggles with drug addiction in his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things\" - writing in one eye-watering extract that he was \"smoking crack every 15 minutes.\"\n\nThe book is almost certain to be brought up at trial, with prosecutors expected to lean in on sections in which Biden describes being an addict for four years up to March 2019.\n\nThe defense team has pushed for narrow definitions of the terms \"addict\" and \"user\" and requested instructions requiring an acquittal if the jury determines that the defendant did not consider himself to fit those definitions.\n\n- Rehabilitation -\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" his lawyer Abbe Lowell wrote in court documents.\n\n\"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nThe case comes with Republicans pursuing an impeachment inquiry in Congress into what they claim is a Biden family criminal conspiracy, although they have provided no evidence that the president did anything wrong.\n\nRepublican politicians have accused Hunter Biden of engaging in corrupt business practices in China and Ukraine but he has not been charged with any crimes related to his foreign business dealings.\n\nThe president has repeatedly said he stands by his son and loves him for his attempts to recover from drug addiction, while the White House has not commented on the investigation itself.\n\nProsecutors have said they expect to take three days to present their case, and the entire trial will likely last about two weeks.\n\nHunter Biden faces separate tax evasion charges in his home state of California, in a case set to go to trial later in the year.", "source": {"uri":

But they said a person who had just completed treatment might consider themselves sober.\n\nMore: Hunter Biden trial: Why his gun case hinges on one fateful day when he wasn't using drugs\n\nReporters arrive early for Hunter Biden trial\n\nBy 6:45 am, a dozen reporters had lined up outside the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building in downtown Wilmington for the start of Hunter Biden's will go on trial this week on federal gun charges.\n\nJury selection starts today, with court convening at 8:30 a.m. local time.\n\nThree tents for broadcast stations were set up near the court. A heavy police presence is visible, with several police cars parked along North King Street, which runs along one side the building.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security dog walked up and down the line of reporters, sniffing their bags.\n\nBoggs, the building's late namesake, was a former Republican governor who lost his Senate seat in a 1972 squeaker to Joe Biden.\n\nHunter Biden won't be able to introduce a second federal form during his trial on charges he illegally bought and possessed a gun while addicted to drugs, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika ruled Sunday.\n\nThe president's son is charged with lying on the form and lying to the gun dealer about his drug usage when he bought a .38-caliber pistol in 2018 and had it for 11 days.\n\nOn the initial form submitted to federal authorities soon after buying the gun, Biden put an X next to a question asking if he used narcotics or was addicted to them. The second version of the form was submitted to investigators in 2021 with additional information attached that said Biden submitted his vehicle registration when he bought the gun, which apparently wasn't the case, according to court statements.\n\nBiden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, sought to question the gun shop owner about the second form, arguing he apparently filled out the form inaccurately, which is the charge against Biden. But prosecutors argued the second form is \"irrelevant\" and would confuse jurors. Noreika agreed and barred the form from trial, in one of two rulings Sunday against the defense.\n\n-Xerxes Wilson\n\nMore: These are the people, places that will take center stage in Hunter Biden's trial\n\nJudge bars defense expert on drug addiction from trial\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika barred testimony from one of Hunter Biden's proposed expert witnesses, who the defense sought to give a perspective about how people suffering drug addiction view themselves.\n\nDefense lawyers sought to have Elie Aoun, an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry, to testify to testify about how people who have participated in rehabilitation programs are sometimes in denial about their addiction and view themselves as no longer addicted when they complete a program.\n\nBut Noreika barred the witness Sunday, in one of two decisions against the dense, by ruling the defense failed to provide prosecutors with a proper explanation about what expert opinions Aoun would offer.\n\nBiden's defense also sought testimony from Michael Coyer, a forensic toxicologist, to answer questions about items including a white residue on a brown leather gun pouch that tested positive for cocaine years after it was taken into police custody. Noreika ruled that she would hear from Coyer without the jury present before deciding whether to allow him to testify.\n\nThe first two relate specifically to the form he filled out to purchase a gun in 2018, accusing Biden of lying about this drug use on the form.\n\nThe third charge pertains to Biden's possession of a firearm while he was allegedly an unlawful user or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nThe charges carry a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison, though Biden is likely to get a shorter sentence if convicted. It is atypical for defendants to get a maximum sentence when they are first-time offenders like Biden.", "source": {"uri": "app.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asbury Park Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_possession_of_a_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Criminal possession of a weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Caleb_Boggs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The two criminal cases are not related, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken centre stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $US1.4 million ($A2.1 million) in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a years-long investigation into his business dealings.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs - which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show he was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun - and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence Hunter Biden's published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos where he's often nude and doing drugs and highly personal messages where he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period where, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother Beau Biden from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018, and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his lawyers have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They will also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2024_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beau Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-14891035/0178e73c1f882750dbfef27e154a0ebd466785e1-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-", "textStart": 2853, "textEnd": 2865}], "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty.\n\nWHAT ARE THE CHARGES?\n\nHunter Biden was charged in September by U.S. Special Counsel David Weiss with three felonies stemming from his purchase and possession of a Colt Cobra .38 revolver in October 2018.\n\nThe first two charges overlap. He is accused of making a false statement material to a firearms sale and making a false statement in a firearms transaction record.\n\nProsecutors contend he committed a crime when he ticked a box indicating \"no\" next to a question asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance or addicted to a controlled substance.\n\nThe third charge is that Hunter Biden violated a law that bars users of illegal drugs or drug addicts from possessing a firearm.\n\nHe was separately charged with tax crimes in California in December, also brought by Weiss. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in that case which is scheduled to go to trial in September.\n\nWHAT DOES THE GOVERNMENT HAVE TO PROVE?\n\nFor the first two charges, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Hunter Biden knowingly made a false statement. For one of the first two charges the government must also show the false statement was material to the sale of the gun.\n\nFor the possession charge, the government must prove the following elements: that Biden was either an unlawful user of a controlled substance or was a drug addict; that he knowingly possessed a firearm; and that when he knowingly possessed the firearm he also knew he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance or a drug addict.\n\nWHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S EVIDENCE?\n\nThe government said it has videos and photographs of Hunter Biden smoking crack or with drug paraphernalia as well as messages sent to purported street dealers arranging drug purchases. The evidence was collected from Biden's iCloud account, laptop and phone messages, prosecutors have said.\n\nThe government said it may call Hunter Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, and other romantic partners to describe his addiction around the time of the gun purchase and possession.\n\nProsecutors said they plan to introduce excerpts from Biden's 2021 book, Beautiful Things, in which he described himself as a \"crack addict\" with no plans beyond \"the moment-to-moment demands of the crack pipe.\"\n\nWHAT HAS BIDEN'S LEGAL TEAM SAID?\n\nSome details of Hunter Biden's potential defense can be gleaned from court filings.\n\nBiden's legal team has ridiculed some of the evidence that has surfaced in court filings, comparing some of the work by Weiss's office to that of the slapstick Police Academy films of the 1980s. In one instance, Biden's legal team said what prosecutors claimed was a photo of cocaine was actually sawdust.\n\nHunter Biden's legal team did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWHAT IS THE POTENTIAL SENTENCE?\n\nIf the jury finds Hunter Biden guilty, he faces up to 25 years in prison, although sentences are typically shorter than the maximum, according to the Department of Justice. As in all U.S. federal criminal cases, the jury of 12 must unanimously agree on a conviction.\n\nARE THE CHARGE AGAINST HUNTER BIDEN UNUSUAL?\n\nYes. The government rarely charges someone for false statements on gun purchase forms unless the accused is also charged with a violent crime, according to a Government Accountability Office report cited by Hunter Biden's legal team. More than 80 million American adults own a firearm, but only about 1,000 a year are investigated for false statements on a gun purchase form, and even fewer are charged, according to the GAO.\n\nWHO IS THE JUDGE?\n\nMaryellen Noreika, who was nominated by President Donald Trump and joined the court in 2018. Previously she was a lawyer at the prominent Delaware firm Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell, where she specialized in intellectual property litigation in federal court. She obtained her law degree from the University of Pittsburgh School of law in 1993.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; editing by Amy Stevens and Nick Zieminski)", "source": {"uri":

But last July, a plea bargain fell apart.\n\nIf found guilty, Biden could face 25 years in prison, though in practice such offenses, if not accompanied by other charges, are seldom punished by incarceration.\n\n- 'Rehabilitation' -\n\nJurors will hear about the defendant's drug use as prosecutors run through events that led to him buying the firearm in Delaware.\n\nThe defense team has pushed for narrow definitions of the terms \"addict\" and \"user,\" and requested instructions requiring an acquittal if the jury determines that the defendant did not consider himself to fit those definitions.\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" his lawyer Abbe Lowell wrote in court documents.\n\n\"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nAmong those reportedly expected to testify is the defendant's lover at the time of the firearm incident: Hallie Biden, the widow of Hunter's brother Beau Biden.\n\nThe case comes with Republicans pursuing an impeachment inquiry in Congress into what they claim is a Biden family criminal conspiracy, although they have provided no evidence.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have accused Hunter Biden of engaging in corrupt business practices in China and Ukraine, but he has not been charged with any crimes related to his foreign dealings.\n\nThe president has said he stands by his son and loves him for his attempts to recover from drug addiction.\n\nDemocratic congressman Adam Schiff, a Biden ally, told CNN Sunday that Americans should \"absolutely\" respect the jury's verdict, however it rules.\n\n\"And I think the president himself will respect the verdict -- much as it is painful, I'm sure, to see one of your children on trial.\"\n\nProsecutors have said they expect to take three days to present their case, and the untelevised trial will likely last about two weeks.\n\nHunter Biden faces separate tax evasion charges in California, in a case set for trial later this year.\n\nLast week Trump was convicted in a Manhattan court of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money paid to an adult film star.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

Biden purchased a Colt Cobra .38 Special revolver, and it remained in his possession for 11 days before it was discarded in an outdoor receptacle by Hallie Biden, Hunter Biden's romantic partner at the time.\n\nProsecutors are expected to introduce evidence that details Biden's use of controlled substances leading up to and during the period he purchased the firearm. In their trial brief, they reference Biden's own admission of drug addiction in excerpts from his memoir, Beautiful Things, as well as photos and videos from his laptop and text messages.\n\nProsecutors also intend to include testimony from Hunter Biden's former romantic partners recounting his substance abuse, including his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle and Hallie Biden, the widow of his late brother, Beau Biden, and expert testimony from FBI and DEA agents.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys seek to call their own expert witnesses on addiction and forensic psychiatry and forensic toxicology.\n\nThe charges were brought by special counsel David Weiss who was appointed U.S. attorney for Delaware by former President Donald Trump and named special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2023. Federal probes into Hunter Biden, led by Weiss, spanned five years over the course of both the Trump and Biden administrations.\n\nAttorneys for Hunter Biden asserted that Weiss \"buckled under political pressure to bring more severe charges\" after the plea agreement elicited a \"sharp rebuke\" from former President Trump and his Republican allies when it was first made public. Weiss' office slammed claims that the charges were fueled by politics and were pursued to appease Republicans.\n\n\"The charges in this case are not trumped up or because of former President Trump -- they are instead a result of the defendant's own choices and were brought in spite of, not because of, any outside noise made by politicians,\" prosecutors said.\n\nHunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison and $750,000 in fines if convicted on all counts.\n\nSeparately, he faces nine federal tax charges in the central district of California in a second indictment brought by Weiss' office where federal prosecutors allege President Biden's son engaged in a \"four-year scheme\" to avoid paying at least $1.4 million in federal taxes.\n\nHunter Biden is charged with three felony and six misdemeanor charges related to his alleged failure to file and pay taxes, evasion of assessment, and filing a false or fraudulent tax return. Biden has pleaded not guilty to those charges.\n\nHis motions to dismiss the federal tax charges were all denied by U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi in April. If convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 17 years in prison.\n\nReferences to the tax charges or questioning related to those charges or the plea hearing are not admissible in his federal gun trial in

The trial stems from federal gun charges brought against him by special counsel David Weiss.\n\nHunter Biden pleaded not guilty to federal gun charges in U.S. District Court for Delaware after Weiss charged him with making a false statement in the purchase of a firearm; making a false statement related to information required to be kept by a licensed firearm dealer; and one count of possession of a firearm by a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance.\n\nWith all counts combined, the total maximum prison time for the charges could be up to 25 years. Each count carries a maximum fine of $250,000 and three years of supervised release.\n\nThe trial begins nearly a year after presiding Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned a plea deal between prosecutors and Hunter Biden, which subsequently fell apart.\n\nJUDGE BARS PROSECUTORS FROM USING SOME SALACIOUS EVIDENCE IN HUNTER BIDEN'S GUN TRIAL\n\nThe agreement, blasted as a \"sweetheart\" deal by congressional Republicans, appeared to convey broad immunity to the president's son on a host of potential criminal charges.\n\nAccording to an indictment, Hunter Biden bought a Colt Cobra revolver Oct. 12, 2018, and \"knowingly made a false and fictitious written statement, intended and likely to deceive that dealer with respect to a fact material to the lawfulness of the sale of the firearm ... certifying he was not an unlawful user of, and addicted to, any stimulant, narcotic drug, and any other controlled substance, when in fact, as he knew, that statement was false and fictitious.\"\n\nThe indictment also charges Hunter Biden with possessing that gun, which was \"shipped and transported in interstate commerce,\" for nearly a week despite being addicted to narcotics.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN IS IN COURT IN DELAWARE. HERE'S WHAT HE DOESN'T WANT THE JURY TO HEAR\n\nFox News first reported in 2021 that police had responded to an incident in 2018, when a gun owned by Hunter was thrown into a trash can outside a market in Delaware.\n\nA source with knowledge of the Oct. 23, 2018, police report told Fox News it indicated that Hallie Biden, who is the widow of President Biden's late son, Beau, and who was in a relationship with Hunter at the time, threw a gun owned by Hunter in a dumpster behind a market near a school.\n\nHallie Biden may be required to testify during Hunter Biden's trial.\n\nA firearm transaction report reviewed by Fox News indicated Hunter purchased a gun earlier that month.\n\nOn the firearm transaction report, Hunter answered in the negative when asked if he was \"an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.\"\n\nHunter was discharged from the Navy in 2014 after testing positive for cocaine.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO FEDERAL GUN CHARGES OUT OF SPECIAL COUNSEL DAVID WEISS' PROBE\n\nJudge Noreika ruled ahead of the trial that Weiss's team cannot use some salacious evidence in the first son's criminal trial, including references to the Navy discharge and his child support case for his out-of-wedlock daughter in Arkansas.\n\nNoreika also said Weiss must show Hunter Biden was addicted to drugs but not necessarily using drugs the day he purchased the gun.\n\nNoreika said the government may use part of Hunter Biden's book in which he discusses his addiction to drugs.\n\nThe prosecution does not plan to bring out the entire infamous laptop containing details of Hunter Biden's life but will introduce certain portions. Noreika ruled that Hunter Biden's team will be able to question aspects of the laptop in front of the jury. The laptop, which leaked in 2020 just before the presidential election, was decried as Russian disinformation by 51 former intelligence officials.\n\nNoreika also ruled that the special counsel cannot mention Hunter Biden's pending federal tax trial in California during the trial in Delaware, which is also part of Weiss's investigation and scheduled for a September trial.\n\nHunter Biden pleaded not guilty to those charges -- specifically, three felonies and six misdemeanors concerning $1.4 million in owed taxes that have since been paid. Weiss alleged a \"four-year scheme\" when the president's son did not pay his federal income taxes from January 2017 to October 2020 while also filing false tax reports.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN TAX TRIAL POSTPONED TO SEPTEMBER\n\nJudge Mark Scarsi heard arguments during a pre-trial hearing in California last month. That criminal trial was scheduled for June 20, but Hunter Biden's attorneys requested to delay the trial.\n\nScarsi sided with Hunter Biden's attorneys, and moved the tax trial to Sept. 5, when jury selection will begin.", "source": {"uri": "1010wcsi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "1010 WCSI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org",

He will become the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be criminally tried when jury selection begins on Monday.\n\nWhile Hunter Biden's past drug use has been well-documented, he has pleaded not guilty to the gun charges, arguing that he completed a rehab program shortly before he purchased the gun and checked off \"no\" on a federal form that asked whether he was an \"unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance.\"\n\nCourt filings submitted by Hunter Biden's legal team last week indicate that the defense intends to question the quality of the prosecution's evidence and argue that the president's son was not using illicit drugs at the time of his gun purchase, while also questioning the language used on the federal form.\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" the filing states. \"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out for comment to the Department of Justice (DOJ) via online press contact form on Sunday.\n\nHunter Biden's ex-wife Kathleen Buhle, who has been in an unrelated civil court battle with the president's son over unpaid alimony for several years, is expected to testify for the prosecution. His former girlfriend Hallie Biden, the widow of Hunter's deceased brother Beau Biden, is also expected to testify.\n\nThe charges against Hunter Biden sprang from the investigations of DOJ special counsel David Weiss, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, who became the first U.S. president to be convicted of criminal charges when a New York jury found him guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records on Thursday. Trump has maintained his innocence and says the case is politically motivated. His legal team says they will fight the case, which will include an appeal, if necessary.\n\nA second Hunter Biden trial, which also emerged from Weiss' investigations, is set to begin on September 5 in California. The president's son has pleaded not guilty to charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in owed federal taxes.\n\nHunter Biden nearly avoided facing both trials with a plea agreement that would have seen him plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges, enter into a period of probation and likely escape the gun charges.\n\nThe deal fell apart last summer after U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, a Trump appointee, refused to accept its terms. Republicans had repeatedly blasted the agreement as a \"sweetheart deal\" for the president's son prior to it being dismantled.\n\nNeither of the upcoming trials concern claims that Hunter Biden and Joe Biden engaged in a corrupt scheme to use the elder Biden's political influence for financial gain abroad -- unproven allegations that have been the focus of intense congressional Republican investigations for several years. The White House has repeatedly denied the allegations and has called the investigation a \"baseless political stunt.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aila_slisco@newsweek.com", "name": "Aila Slisco", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Controlled substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Buhle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kathleen Buhle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beau Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(common_law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil law (common law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alimony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alimony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show_Jumping", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show Jumping", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2402584/hunter-biden-trial-begin-gun-charges.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=d0cd9435bd2456364ff0fdc42317813f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-05", "textStart": 2346, "textEnd": 2357}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Caleb Boggs Federal Building in downtown Wilmington for the start of Hunter Biden's will go on trial this week on federal gun charges.\n\nJury selection starts today, with court convening at 8:30 a.m. local time.\n\nThree tents for broadcast stations were set up near the court. A heavy police presence is visible, with several police cars parked along North King Street, which runs along one side the building.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security dog walked up and down the line of reporters, sniffing their bags.\n\nBoggs, the building's late namesake, was a former Republican governor who lost his Senate seat in a 1972 squeaker to Joe Biden.\n\n-Swapna Venugopal\n\nJudge: No second gun form at trial\n\nHunter Biden won't be able to introduce a second federal form during his trial on charges he illegally bought and possessed a gun while addicted to drugs, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika ruled Sunday.\n\nThe president's son is charged with lying on the form and lying to the gun dealer about his drug usage when he bought a .38-caliber pistol in 2018 and had it for 11 days.\n\nOn the initial form submitted to federal authorities soon after buying the gun, Biden put an X next to a question asking if he used narcotics or was addicted to them. The second version of the form was submitted to investigators in 2021 with additional information attached that said Biden submitted his vehicle registration when he bought the gun, which apparently wasn't the case, according to court statements.\n\nBiden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, sought to question the gun shop owner about the second form, arguing he apparently filled out the form inaccurately, which is the charge against Biden. But prosecutors argued the second form is \"irrelevant\" and would confuse jurors. Noreika agreed and barred the form from trial, in one of two rulings Sunday against the defense.\n\n-Xerxes Wilson\n\nMore: These are the people, places that will take center stage in Hunter Biden's trial\n\nJudge bars defense expert on drug addiction from trial\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika barred testimony from one of Hunter Biden's proposed expert witnesses, who the defense sought to give a perspective about how people suffering drug addiction view themselves.\n\nDefense lawyers sought to have Elie Aoun, an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry, to testify to testify about how people who have participated in rehabilitation programs are sometimes in denial about their addiction and view themselves as no longer addicted when they complete a program.\n\nBut Noreika barred the witness Sunday, in one of two decisions against the dense, by ruling the defense failed to provide prosecutors with a proper explanation about what expert opinions Aoun would offer.\n\nBiden's defense also sought testimony from Michael Coyer, a forensic toxicologist, to answer questions about items including a white residue on a brown leather gun pouch that tested positive for cocaine years after it was taken into police custody. Noreika ruled that she would hear from Coyer without the jury present before deciding whether to allow him to testify.\n\n-Xerxes Wilson\n\nWho is Hunter Biden?\n\nHunter Biden is President Joe Biden's youngest son. He's facing three firearms felonies in Delaware.\n\nThe first two relate specifically to the form he filled out to purchase a gun in 2018, accusing Biden of lying about this drug use on the form.\n\nThe third charge pertains to Biden's possession of a firearm while he was allegedly an unlawful user or addicted to controlled substances.\n\n- Xerxes Wilson\n\nCould Hunter Biden go to prison?\n\nThe charges carry a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison, though Biden is likely to get a shorter sentence if convicted. It is atypical for defendants to get a maximum sentence when they are first-time offenders like Biden.\n\n- Xerxes Wilson\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Hunter Biden trial live updates: Will Joe Biden's son go to prison?", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marina_pitofsky@aol.com", "name": "Marina Pitofsky", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "bart_jansen@aol.com", "name": "Bart Jansen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "swapna_venugopal_ramaswamy@aol.com", "name": "Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Caleb_Boggs", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

However, the fact is that voters' attitude toward the younger Biden are baked into the race already. Barring major revelations (and none are expected), the trial will reflect badly on Hunter Biden but not his father.\n\nThe tax evasion trial set for September is going to be far more explosive. it wouldn't be surprising if the younger Biden's attorneys try to delay the trial until after the election.\n\nBy contrast, the gun trial is going to be boring. Hunter Biden is charged \"with making a false statement in the purchase of a firearm; making a false statement related to information required to be kept by a licensed firearm dealer; and one count of possession of a firearm by a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance,\" according to Fox News.\n\nFew voters are going to hold Joe Biden responsible for his son's drug addiction, which will be prominently featured by both the defense and the prosecution. The case may even elicit some sympathy for the president. But Hunter Biden is facing other, far more serious charges, including the charge that he perjured himself while testifying to Congress.\n\nLost in the shuffle will be how this trial and the tax evasion trial came into being in the first place. The younger Biden had a sweetheart deal with prosecutors that would have kept him out of jail on the gun charge and given him probation for evading $1.4 million in taxes. It would have basically wiped the slate clean, giving Biden 2 years probation for felony gun possession and serious tax delinquency.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned the deal, and the plea agreement fell apart. A few weeks later, David Weiss, the Trump-nominated U.S. attorney in Delaware, was named as a special counsel.\n\nHunter Biden was then indicted on the gun charges and Weiss charged him with tax evasion.\n\nThe bad blood between Biden's attorneys and the prosecutors will be on full display during the trial as the younger Biden's lawyers think Weiss double-crossed them. Chris Clark, one of Biden's attorneys, resigned because of his involvement in negotiating the sweetheart deal.\n\n\"Mr. Biden is not being prosecuted for any sin that DOJ (the Department of Justice) believes he has committed. He is being punished for the perceived sins of his father -- the sin of opposing Mr. Trump's election to the president,\" according to court papers filed by Hunter Biden's attorney, Abbe Lowell, who accuses Weiss of bowing to \"political pressure\" to indict the president's son.\n\nAssociated Press:\n\nProsecutors say Lowell's contention is \"fiction designed for a Hollywood script.\"\n\n\"Contrary to his assertion, he has not established that the Special Counsel, appointed by and serving at the pleasure of President Biden and his Attorney General, is punishing the defendant 'for the perceived sins of his father' in order to capitulate to a former President because of his tweets,\" Weiss' team responded.\n\nWeiss has said \"political considerations\" played no part in the investigation. He told lawmakers behind closed doors last year that that no one at the Justice Department prevented him from pursuing charges or taking other necessary steps, disputing claims from two IRS whistleblowers that the department improperly interfered in the tax investigation.\n\nWeiss, you'll recall, is also accused of putting his thumb on the scale in the matter of Biden's confused, addled testimony in the classified documents case.\n\nHunter Biden has said he's been sober since 2019, a claim that prosecutors won't challenge but will use to show that Biden made a false statement on the application for a firearm license regarding his addiction to cocaine.\n\nBiden also owes his ex-wife millions in alimony, penalties, and interest. She is set to testify after finding the gun in Biden's truck and disposing of it.

But last July, a plea bargain fell apart.\n\nIf found guilty, he could face 25 years in prison, though in practice such offences, if not accompanied by other charges, are seldom punished by incarceration.\n\nJurors will hear about the defendant's drug use as prosecutors run through events that led to him buying the firearm in Delaware.\n\nThe defence team has pushed for narrow definitions of the terms \"addict\" and \"user,\" and requested instructions requiring an acquittal if the jury determines that the defendant did not consider himself to fit those definitions.\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" his lawyer Abbe Lowell wrote in court documents.\n\n\"Someone, like Mr Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation programme and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nThe case comes with Republicans pursuing an impeachment inquiry in Congress into what they claim is a Biden family criminal conspiracy, although they have provided no evidence.\n\nRepublicans have accused Hunter Biden of engaging in corrupt business practices in China and Ukraine, but he has not been charged with any crimes related to his foreign dealings.\n\nThe president has said he stands by his son and loves him for his attempts to recover from drug addiction.\n\nDemocratic congressman Adam Schiff, a Biden ally, told CNN Sunday that Americans should \"absolutely\" respect the jury's verdict, however it rules.\n\n\"And I think the president himself will respect the verdict -- much as it is painful, I'm sure, to see one of your children on trial.\"\n\nProsecutors have said they expect to take three days to present their case, and the untelevised trial will likely last about two weeks.\n\nHunter Biden faces separate tax evasion charges in California, in a case set for trial later this year.\n\nLast week Trump was convicted in a Manhattan court of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money paid to an adult film actress.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"},

Charged with three felonies, Biden has pleaded not guilty. The government must prove he knowingly made false statements and possessed a firearm while being a drug user.\n\nHunter Biden, the son of U.S. President Joe Biden, is scheduled to go on trial on June 3 in Delaware on charges he violated federal gun laws in 2018 when he purchased a firearm. Below is a look at the charges, evidence and potential sentence if he is found guilty. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty.\n\nWHAT ARE THE CHARGES? Hunter Biden was charged in September by U.S. Special Counsel David Weiss with three felonies stemming from his purchase and possession of a Colt Cobra .38 revolver in October 2018.\n\nThe first two charges overlap. He is accused of making a false statement material to a firearms sale and making a false statement in a firearms transaction record. Prosecutors contend he committed a crime when he ticked a box indicating \"no\" next to a question asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance or addicted to a controlled substance.\n\nThe third charge is that Hunter Biden violated a law that bars users of illegal drugs or drug addicts from possessing a firearm. He was separately charged with tax crimes in California in December, also brought by Weiss. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in that case which is scheduled to go to trial in September.\n\nWHAT DOES THE GOVERNMENT HAVE TO PROVE? For the first two charges, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Hunter Biden knowingly made a false statement. For one of the first two charges the government must also show the false statement was material to the sale of the gun.\n\nFor the possession charge, the government must prove the following elements: that Biden was either an unlawful user of a controlled substance or was a drug addict; that he knowingly possessed a firearm; and that when he knowingly possessed the firearm he also knew he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance or a drug addict. WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S EVIDENCE?\n\nThe government said it has videos and photographs of Hunter Biden smoking crack or with drug paraphernalia as well as messages sent to purported street dealers arranging drug purchases. The evidence was collected from Biden's iCloud account, laptop and phone messages, prosecutors have said. The government said it may call Hunter Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, and other romantic partners to describe his addiction around the time of the gun purchase and possession.\n\nProsecutors said they plan to introduce excerpts from Biden's 2021 book, Beautiful Things, in which he described himself as a \"crack addict\" with no plans beyond \"the moment-to-moment demands of the crack pipe.\" WHAT HAS BIDEN'S LEGAL TEAM SAID?\n\nSome details of Hunter Biden's potential defense can be gleaned from court filings. Biden's legal team has ridiculed some of the evidence that has surfaced in court filings, comparing some of the work by Weiss's office to that of the slapstick Police Academy films of the 1980s. In one instance, Biden's legal team said what prosecutors claimed was a photo of cocaine was actually sawdust.\n\nHunter Biden's legal team did not respond to a request for comment. WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL SENTENCE?\n\nIf the jury finds Hunter Biden guilty, he faces up to 25 years in prison, although sentences are typically shorter than the maximum, according to the Department of Justice. As in all U.S. federal criminal cases, the jury of 12 must unanimously agree on a conviction. ARE THE CHARGE AGAINST HUNTER BIDEN UNUSUAL?\n\nYes. The government rarely charges someone for false statements on gun purchase forms unless the accused is also charged with a violent crime, according to a Government Accountability Office report cited by Hunter Biden's legal team. More than 80 million American adults own a firearm, but only about 1,000 a year are investigated for false statements on a gun purchase form, and even fewer are charged, according to the GAO. WHO IS THE JUDGE?\n\nMaryellen Noreika, who was nominated by President Donald Trump and joined the court in 2018. Previously she was a lawyer at the prominent Delaware firm Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell, where she specialized in intellectual property litigation in federal court. She obtained her law degree from the University of Pittsburgh School of law in 1993.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source":

During that period, prosecutors allege he lied about his substance abuse on a federal form to illegally purchase a firearm.\n\nSpecial Counsel David Weiss has indicated he plans to raise painful events from the Biden family's past related to Hunter's conduct and events that involve the president. Still, White House officials largely view the trial as a private matter for Mr Biden's son tied to his personal behaviour from years ago.\n\nThe president, who is expected to travel to France during part of the trial, will be monitoring it primarily as a concerned parent who has supported his son's recovery from addiction, according to a person familiar with his thinking.\n\nThere are no plans for the White House to publicly engage with the trial, said the person, who requested anonymity to discuss how the president and his staff view the legal matter. But those plans could change, and the person did not rule out the possibility of the president reacting to developments in real time.\n\nWhile the possibility exists for a last-minute plea deal between the two sides, Hunter Biden's legal team is prepared to argue the charges are unconstitutional and violate the Second Amendment, as well as point out flaws in the government's evidence.\n\nMr Dick Harpootlian, a Biden ally and former South Carolina prosecutor, said jurors in Biden's home state might wonder why prosecutors brought the criminal case against him now that he's shaken his drug addiction.\n\n\"It only takes one for a hung jury, and I can definitely see one or more jurors questioning the propriety of bringing this case,\" said Mr Harpootlian, who now serves as a state senator.\n\nBiden's trial represents another highly politicized spectacle following the former President Trump's criminal trial in New York, which ended May 30 with his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up an affair with a porn star during the 2016 race.\n\nHunter Biden also has been charged by Weiss in Los Angeles for nine federal tax violations and is scheduled to go on trial in that case in September.\n\nThe gun trial is expected to be short but dramatic, with prosecutors airing details about Hunter Biden's drug-laden years that include excerpts from a book he wrote about it, Beautiful Things: A Memoir.\n\n\"His book is replete with admissions that establish he knew he was an addict and knew he was using crack cocaine throughout 2018, including in October 2018 when he purchased and possessed the gun,\" prosecutors wrote in a May 20 trial brief.\n\nFordham University law professor Cheryl Bader, an ex-assistant US attorney who now runs the school's criminal-law clinic, said Biden's chances of winning an acquittal are slim given his acknowledgment in his memoir.\n\nBiden has been open about his struggles with alcohol and drugs but said he has remained sober since mid-2019.\n\nFederal prosecutors \"only bring cases that they are confident they can win, and they are known for dotting their I's and crossing their T's,\" Ms Bader said.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person",

A third count alleges that Hunter, who has been open about his addiction issues, possessed the revolver while using a narcotic.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Hunter owned the gun for 11 days before his girlfriend threw it in a dumpster, citing concerns about his mental health.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer.\n\nOnce 12 jurors and four alternates are selected, the trial will move into opening statements.

But in 2021, gun store employees made a copy that included some handwritten notes. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell contended that employees had \"tampered with\" the document, and that it raised questions about \"who wrote what on the form, and when.\"\n\nLowell hoped his argument would undermine the credibility of some key government witnesses -- the people who sold Biden the gun -- and potentially create a reasonable doubt that Hunter Biden was the one who actually checked that box.\n\nAttorneys for special counsel David Weiss' office have said the gun shop employees merely \"annotated\" the form and urged Noreika to prevent Lowell from introducing it into evidence.\n\nJury selection is scheduled to get underway today in the federal gun trial of Hunter Biden, who authorities say broke the law when he purchased a Colt revolver in 2018.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's son faces two counts of making false statements while purchasing the firearm and a third count of illegally obtaining it while addicted to drugs.\n\nAlthough the charges together carry a possible sentence of up to 25 years, legal experts say that, as a first-time and nonviolent offender, Hunter Biden would not likely serve time if convicted.\n\nThe trial, in Delaware federal court, is expected to last two to three weeks.", "source": {"uri": "mix1027.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WCPZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Caleb_Boggs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

(AP) -- A federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter opened Monday with jury selection, following the collapse of a plea deal that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden was seated in the front row of the courtroom, in a show of support for her son.\n\nIn a statement, the president said he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants by saying he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nIn Delaware, prospective jurors who answered \"yes\" on a questionnaire were quizzed individually by Judge Maryellen Noreika to determine whether they could be fair and impartial. One by one, they were dismissed, winnowing down the pool.\n\nThe questions ranged from their knowledge of the case to their thoughts about gun ownership and whether they or anyone close to them have struggled with substance abuse or addiction or ever owned a gun. Other questions focused on the role politics may have played in the charges.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOne prospective juror said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she replied when an attorney asked her opinion. Another prospective juror was dismissed because his family has a long history in law enforcement, and he said he could not be impartial. A third was excused because he was very aware of the case, and, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nOnly one potential juror answered \"no\" to all the questions and moved on to the next phase. Another who was not dismissed said he holds a concealed carry permit and owns three handguns. The man said he has strong views on gun ownership and believes every law-abiding citizen should be able to own a gun.\n\n\"I believe the Second Amendment is very important,\" he explained.\n\nAttorneys jointly moved to dismiss a woman who expressed strong anti-gun views during questioning.\n\n\"I would like stronger laws in this country about certain types of weapons,\" she said. \"The ones with high repeat, you know, that kill children in schools.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe woman also said the government should require more background checks and make it harder to get a gun \"that can kill a lot of people at once.\"\n\n\"I would ban them altogether to be honest,\" acknowledged the woman, who also said she has donated to Democratic congressional candidates around the country and joined \"one of the resistance groups\" after the 2016 election.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first to the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court, and his wife Melissa. The president in Wilmington until he left for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nDefense attorneys have suggested they may argue that Hunter Biden didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They will also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

Hunter Biden was indicted in September on three felony gun charges for allegedly making false statements on a firearm purchase form and knowingly possessing a gun in 2018 while addicted to drugs.\n\nWitnesses to be called during the trial could include three women with whom Hunter Biden was romantically involved, his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle, his late brother's widow Hallie Biden, and Zoe Kestan, according to the New York Post.\n\nFor evidence, prosecutors said they intend to cite portions of Hunter Biden's memoir, Beautiful Things, where he describes his drug use in 2018. They also will introduce text messages that address his drug usage in 2018. Some messages and material were obtained from his abandoned laptop.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys have challenged the authenticity of evidence on the laptop, though prosecutors said his claims were \"a conspiracy theory with no supporting evidence.\"\n\n\"He has not provided any evidence or information that shows that his laptop contains false information, and the government's evidence shows the opposite - the defendant's laptop is real,\" prosecutors responded in court filings.\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika, who is overseeing the trial, granted Weiss' request Sunday to stop a doctor Hunter Biden wanted to call as an expert witness from testifying.\n\n\"The inadequacy of Defendant's expert disclosure for Dr. Aoun leaves the government in the dark as to what his opinions about the facts of this case will be, thus rendering the government unable to prepare for trial,\" Noreika wrote.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys continually tried to delay the trial and dismiss the case, citing constitutional problems with the indictment and violations of the pretrial diversion agreement they argued remained valid.

By Reuters", "body": "WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - Hunter Biden, the son of U.S. President Joe Biden, is scheduled to go on trial on June 3 in Delaware on charges he violated federal gun laws in 2018 when he purchased a firearm.\n\nBelow is a look at the charges, evidence and potential sentence if he is found guilty. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty.\n\nWHAT ARE THE CHARGES?\n\nHunter Biden was charged in September by U.S. Special Counsel David Weiss with three felonies stemming from his purchase and possession of a Colt Cobra .38 revolver in October 2018.\n\nThe first two charges overlap. He is accused of making a false statement material to a firearms sale and making a false statement in a firearms transaction record.\n\nProsecutors contend he committed a crime when he ticked a box indicating \"no\" next to a question asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance or addicted to a controlled substance.\n\nThe third charge is that Hunter Biden violated a law that bars users of illegal drugs or drug addicts from possessing a firearm.\n\nHe was separately charged with tax crimes in California in December, also brought by Weiss. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in that case which is scheduled to go to trial in September.\n\nWHAT DOES THE GOVERNMENT HAVE TO PROVE?\n\nFor the first two charges, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Hunter Biden knowingly made a false statement. For one of the first two charges the government must also show the false statement was material to the sale of the gun.\n\nFor the possession charge, the government must prove the following elements: that Biden was either an unlawful user of a controlled substance or was a drug addict; that he knowingly possessed a firearm; and that when he knowingly possessed the firearm he also knew he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance or a drug addict.\n\nWHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S EVIDENCE?\n\nThe government said it has videos and photographs of Hunter Biden smoking crack or with drug paraphernalia as well as messages sent to purported street dealers arranging drug purchases. The evidence was collected from Biden's iCloud account, laptop and phone messages, prosecutors have said.\n\nThe government said it may call Hunter Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, and other romantic partners to describe his addiction around the time of the gun purchase and possession.\n\nProsecutors said they plan to introduce excerpts from Biden's 2021 book, Beautiful Things, in which he described himself as a \"crack addict\" with no plans beyond \"the moment-to-moment demands of the crack pipe.\"\n\nWHAT HAS BIDEN'S LEGAL TEAM SAID?\n\nSome details of Hunter Biden's potential defense can be gleaned from court filings.\n\nBiden's legal team has ridiculed some of the evidence that has surfaced in court filings, comparing some of the work by Weiss's office to that of the slapstick Police Academy films of the 1980s. In one instance, Biden's legal team said what prosecutors claimed was a photo of cocaine was actually sawdust.\n\nHunter Biden's legal team did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWHAT IS THE POTENTIAL SENTENCE?\n\nIf the jury finds Hunter Biden guilty, he faces up to 25 years in prison, although sentences are typically shorter than the maximum, according to the Department of Justice. As in all U.S. federal criminal cases, the jury of 12 must unanimously agree on a conviction.\n\nARE THE CHARGE AGAINST HUNTER BIDEN UNUSUAL?\n\nYes. The government rarely charges someone for false statements on gun purchase forms unless the accused is also charged with a violent crime, according to a Government Accountability Office report cited by Hunter Biden's legal team. More than 80 million American adults own a firearm, but only about 1,000 a year are investigated for false statements on a gun purchase form, and even fewer are charged, according to the GAO.\n\nMaryellen Noreika, who was nominated by President Donald Trump and joined the court in 2018.

He is charged with two counts related to false statements in purchasing the firearm and a third count of illegally obtaining a firearm while addicted to drugs.\n\nBut Hunter Biden's legal team believes it can throw a wrench in Weiss' tidy narrative. At a recent pretrial hearing, an attorney for Biden suggested the firearm form at the heart of the case was \"much more complicated than [the] special counsel indicates it is.\"\n\nMORE: Special counsel plans to use infamous laptop as evidence in Hunter Biden's firearm trial\n\nJury selection for the trial is set to begin on Monday. And if 12 Delaware residents accept the government's story, the president's only living son could face a prison sentence.\n\nThe task of fighting that outcome falls to Abbe Lowell, a veteran defense attorney who has represented several other high-profile figures, including Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.\n\nHow Lowell plans to fight the charges remains somewhat unclear. He has signaled to U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika that the contours of his case would depend in large part on how prosecutors proceed at trial.\n\nBut in court records and at pretrial hearings, he has offered some tea leaves -- and suggested he will attempt to cast doubt on some of the government's most crucial evidence and witnesses.\n\n'Tampered' or 'annotated'?\n\nLowell has, for example, latched onto revelations in court that two copies exist of the federal gun form at the heart of the case, called an ATF Form 4473. A shop employee created the original document when Hunter Biden purchased the firearm in 2018. It lists Biden's passport as the ID he presented to the shop employee.\n\nYears later, however, a copy was made. The copy included a handwritten note, \"DE Vehicle Registration,\" on a line left blank for \"Supplemental Government Issued Documentation.\" Store employees did so in 2021 to rectify a requirement that gun buyers present a form of ID that includes an address, which passports do not.\n\nLowell contends that gun store employees \"tampered with\" the document, and that it raises questions about \"who wrote what on the form, and when.\"\n\nWeiss' office has said the gun shop employees merely \"annotated\" the document. But they took Lowell's argument seriously enough to re-interview the gun store owner, Ronald Palimere, on May 16.\n\nDuring the interview, according to notes filed on the case docket, Palimere said Hunter Biden's legal tribulations were becoming \"a big scandal and there was intense attention on the incident,\" and that employees at the store \"were all scared to death.\"\n\nPalimere \"felt it was necessary to annotate the Form 4473 because he felt they were going to get in trouble just for going up against Biden,\" according to the notes.\n\nIf jurors are persuaded by Lowell's tack, the argument could undermine the credibility of some key government witnesses -- the people who sold Biden the gun -- and potentially create a reasonable doubt that Hunter Biden was the one who actually checked that box.\n\nAt least two gun store employees, including Palimere, are expected to testify at the trial.\n\nThe definition of 'is'\n\nLowell may also advance the argument that Hunter Biden may have been confused by the language on the ATF Form 4473. The box he checked \"no\" asked of the buyer, \"Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to\" various narcotics.\n\n\"The issue here is Mr. Biden's understanding of the question, which asks in the present tense if he 'is' a user or addict,\" Lowell wrote in court papers.\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" he continued. \"Someone like Mr. Biden, who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nMORE: Special counsel in Hunter Biden case plans to call his ex-wife, brother's widow as witnesses in upcoming trial\n\nFinally, Lowell has raised \"an issue of chain of custody\" with a leather pouch that allegedly held the revolver Hunter Biden purchased. In court documents filed earlier this year, prosecutors said this pouch had cocaine residue on it.\n\nAfter purchasing the firearm in 2018, Hunter Biden possessed it for less than two weeks before his then-romantic partner, Hallie Biden - who is also the widow of his brother, Beau - discovered the weapon and the pouch, discarded them in a dumpster.\n\nThe gun was soon recovered by the authorities, but the pouch was not tested for drug residue until five years later, in 2023. Lowell said at the pretrial hearing that he wants to question witnesses about what happened to the pouch during those five years when it was in police custody to see if it was \"tampered with.\"\n\nOne of the witnesses Lowell plans to call for the defense is a chemical residue expert.\n\nThe government's case\n\nProsecutors hope these arguments fall flat, and that jurors rely on the voluminous evidence they plan to present to find Hunter Biden guilty of committing the three felony charges he faces.\n\nProsecutors seem poised to use Hunter Biden's own words against him -- excerpts from his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" and text messages he exchanged around the time of the gun purchase -- to demonstrate that he was in fact a drug user when he filled out the ATF Form 4473 and procured the weapon.\n\nIn one text message prosecutors included in court filings, Hunter Biden wrote two days after allegedly purchasing the gun: \"I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney,\" referring to an intersection in Wilmington.\n\nWeiss' office also plans to show jurors the original ATF Form 4473, in which Biden represented that \"he was not an unlawful user of, or addicted to, any stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance\" -- despite allegedly knowing it not to be true.\n\nProsecutors indicated that they plan to call as many as 12 witnesses, including Hallie Biden and Hunter Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle.\n\nMORE: Judge denies Hunter Biden's attempt to dismiss federal gun charges\n\nLowell has not yet decided whether Hunter Biden will testify in his own defense.\n\nThe trial begins on Monday and is expected to last two to three weeks. If he's found guilty, Biden could face a prison sentence of up to 25 years, though legal experts suggest that, as a first-time and nonviolent offender, he would not likely serve time.\n\nWeiss' office also charged Hunter Biden in December with nine felony and misdemeanor charges stemming from his failure to pay $1.4 million in taxes for three years during a time when he was in the throes of addiction. The back taxes and penalties were eventually paid in full by a third party, identified by ABC News as Hunter Biden's attorney and confidant, Kevin Morris. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nThe trial in that case was scheduled to begin on June 20 in California, but Lowell successfully petitioned the judge to postpone it until Sept. 5 -- raising the likelihood that a jury could be deliberating whether to convict the president's son on several felony counts in the waning weeks of the 2024 election.\n\nAs Hunter Biden goes to trial

Now Hunter Biden's gun trial is set to start", "body": "Chris Strohm, Jef Feeley and Jordan Fabian - Bloomberg News (TNS)\n\nWASHINGTON -- Hunter Biden is set to become the first child of a sitting U.S. president tried for crimes, just days after the historic guilty verdict against Donald Trump -- two events that may inject fresh uncertainty into the 2024 election.\n\nJury selection begins Monday in the first of two cases Hunter Biden has tried to avoid for years, both to stay out of prison and spare his father, President Joe Biden, political and personal turmoil as he runs for a second term most likely against Trump.\n\nThe trial in Wilmington, Delaware, on three federal gun violations is expected to plumb the depths of the younger Biden's drug use. During that period, prosecutors allege he lied about his substance abuse on a federal form to illegally purchase a firearm.\n\nSpecial Counsel David Weiss has indicated he plans to raise painful events from the Biden family's past related to Hunter's conduct and events that involve the president. Still, White House officials largely view the trial as a private matter for Biden's son tied to his personal behavior from years ago.\n\nThe president, who is expected to travel to France during part of the trial, will be monitoring it primarily as a concerned parent who has supported his son's recovery from addiction, according to a person familiar with his thinking.\n\nThere are no plans for the White House to publicly engage with the trial, said the person, who requested anonymity to discuss how the president and his staff view the legal matter. But those plans could change, and the person did not rule out the possibility of the president reacting to developments in real time.\n\nPlea possibility\n\nWhile the possibility exists for a last-minute plea deal between the two sides, Hunter Biden's legal team is prepared to argue the charges are unconstitutional and violate the Second Amendment, as well as point out flaws in the government's evidence.\n\nDick Harpootlian, a Biden ally and former South Carolina prosecutor, said jurors in Biden's home state might wonder why prosecutors brought the criminal case against him now that he's shaken his drug addiction.\n\n\"It only takes one for a hung jury, and I can definitely see one or more jurors questioning the propriety of bringing this case,\" said Harpootlian, who now serves as a state senator.\n\nBiden's trial represents another highly politicized spectacle following the former President Trump's criminal trial in New York, which ended Thursday with his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up an affair with a porn star during the 2016 race.\n\nHunter Biden also has been charged by Weiss in Los Angeles for nine federal tax violations and is scheduled to go on trial in that case in September.\n\nThe gun trial is expected to be short but dramatic, with prosecutors airing details about Hunter Biden's drug-laden years that include excerpts from a book he wrote about it, \"Beautiful Things: A Memoir.\"\n\n\"His book is replete with admissions that establish he knew he was an addict and knew he was using crack cocaine throughout 2018, including in October 2018 when he purchased and possessed the gun,\" prosecutors wrote in a May 20 trial brief.\n\nFordham University law professor Cheryl Bader, an ex-assistant U.S. attorney who now runs the school's criminal law clinic, said Biden's chances of winning an acquittal are slim given his acknowledgment in his memoir.\n\nBiden has been open about his struggles with alcohol and drugs but said he has remained sober since mid-2019.\n\nFederal prosecutors \"only bring cases that they are confident they can win, and they are known for dotting their I's and crossing their T's,\" Bader said.\n\nTwo of the gun counts carry maximum prison time of 10 years; another is punishable by as much as five years. However, judges rarely impose maximum sentences.\n\nBiden's lawyers plan to challenge the government's charge that he bought the gun while a drug addict as constitutionally vague. They are set to argue that he wasn't using drugs when he bought the gun. They also plan to contend that the seller didn't comply with legal requirements in the gun sale and documentation.\n\n\"Intoxication from too much alcohol or using drugs, legal or illegal, may make it too dangerous for people to drive a car, operate heavy machinery, or possess a firearm one day, but they may be perfectly sober enough to do all those things the next day,\" according to a May 23 trial brief by Biden's lawyers.\n\nWeiss was nominated by Trump to serve as the U.S. attorney for Delaware and kept on by Biden. He was appointed as a special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2023 to manage the cases against Hunter Biden.\n\nBiden and Weiss had agreed to a plea deal last year to resolve both allegations, but the agreement fell apart under questioning by the federal judge overseeing the case. Biden's lawyers and supporters have argued that Weiss then bowed to political pressure by Trump and conservatives in bringing the charges.\n\n-- -- --\n\nThe gun case is U.S. v.

Quickly.", "body": "Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted on three felony gun charges in a trial that is set to begin in Wilmington, Del., on Monday. In the meantime, his father is behind in many polls, his financial benefactor is reportedly \"tapped out\" and his best legal arguments require gutting federal gun control laws. An embarrassing trial that he is likely to lose will only make things worse.\n\nAn early plea agreement -- in which he agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and enter into a deferred prosecution agreement on the gun charges -- fell apart last summer. But a criminal defendant can accept a plea deal from the prosecution anytime before the jury returns its verdict, which means that he might still have a chance to avoid a full trial.\n\nIf he can, he should.\n\nTo bring federal charges, the Department of Justice manual advises that a prosecutor should believe that the defendant is guilty, that the prosecutor believes he has evidence that will prove the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the prosecutor believes that a reasonable jury would convict the defendant. In practice, this means that once the Department of Justice has indicted you, they believe they will win. And they almost always do.\n\nOver a 12-month period ending last fall, just 290 of the nearly 72,000 federal criminal defendants charged by the Justice Department were acquitted at trial. That's less than one half of 1%. (Of course, only 1,379 were convicted at trial -- a paltry 2%.) The vast majority facing a D.O.J. indictment decided either to plead guilty outright or accept a plea deal, believing that the prosecutor had correctly weighed their chances of winning in front of a jury before bringing the case in the first place.\n\nHunter Biden has argued that he was only charged because of his last name. And he has a point -- there are far more gun crimes committed than can be handled by federal prosecutors. The main charge is that he had a gun while using cocaine, which is a rarely used part of the statute. But that's usually because drug use is hard to prove compared to other gun charges, like being a felon with a gun. Here, though, prosecutors have noted that \"investigators literally found drugs on the pouch where the defendant had kept his gun.\" And when prosecutors do bring this charge, people who are found guilty are often sentenced to real prison time -- over a year for someone in Hunter Biden's shoes.\n\nThat would be enough of an incentive for most people to plead guilty to federal gun charges. Hunter Biden has even more.\n\nFirst, there's his father's reputation to consider. Theodore Roosevelt is said to have remarked that he could be president or he could control his daughter, but he couldn't do both. President Biden is faring no better at juggling the two roles. On several occasions he has invited his son to White House events alongside the attorney general who is responsible for prosecuting him. Despite the fact that it is inappropriate for the president to comment on current Justice Department investigations, President Biden was not able to resist publicly stating in May 2023, \"My son has done nothing wrong.\"\n\nLast week, President Biden visited Beau Biden's widow, Hallie Biden, at her home near the anniversary of his older son's death. The problem is that Hallie Biden is also expected to be a key witness against Hunter Biden -- and President Biden's visit raised allegations of witness tampering from the president's critics. A White House spokesman said the president did not discuss the trial during the visit.\n\nOf course, the trial itself will be embarrassing and painful for Hunter Biden and his family. On top of highlighting his past romantic involvement with his brother's widow, the prosecution is expected to introduce evidence, including pictures, text messages, and his own statement that he was smoking crack cocaine \"every 15 minutes, seven days a week,\" despite affirming on a federal form that he was not using any illegal drugs when he purchased the gun.\n\nSecond, he is low on money. Since he met Kevin Morris, a Hollywood entertainment lawyer, at a campaign fund-raiser for his father in 2019, Morris has functioned as a financial lifeline for him, shelling out over $6.5 million to help cover costs related to things like back taxes and child support. He's even agreed to pay nearly $900,000 for some of Hunter Biden's artwork. Now on the brink of trial, Morris has run out of resources to help, according to an associate, and it is unclear how Hunter Biden's legal team will pay for the expert witnesses they were hoping to have testify at trial. Abbe Lowell, his lead attorney for the trial, has reportedly sought fees of over $1,500 per hour in the past -- and he doesn't work alone.\n\nAnd third, Hunter Biden's best arguments aren't even the ones he can make at trial. In his own memoir, he admitted that he regularly used drugs around the time he bought the gun. That means the outcome of the trial seems largely a foregone conclusion. On appeal, however, Hunter Biden is likely to argue that the law itself is an unconstitutional infringement on his Second Amendment rights to own a gun.\n\nThis is a politically tricky, but a legally reasonable argument. After all, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit already held that the law was invalid as applied to admitted marijuana users. But cocaine is different from marijuana, and then there's the awkwardness of the president's son trying to convince the Supreme Court to invalidate part of the most widely used gun control law in the country while his dad campaigns on passing stricter gun control laws.\n\nIn short, Hunter Biden should take whatever deal he is being offered. It doesn't get easier from here.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_possession_of_a_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Criminal possession of a weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theodore Roosevelt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbe_Lowell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abbe Lowell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beau Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witness_tampering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Witness tampering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_support", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child support"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crack cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Airsoft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Airsoft", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://arc.stimg.co/startribunemedia/C6DWYCWIZ5CPDDTLFKVUWSB4GY.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The culmination of a sprawling investigation, the deal between Hunter Biden and prosecutors was going to spare him a politically explosive trial in the middle of his father's reelection campaign and likely prison time.\n\nBut it all fell apart. Now, Hunter Biden is headed to trial on federal gun charges in a case brought by his father's Justice Department at a time when America's political and legal worlds are colliding like never before. Dogged for years by investigations, scrutinized over his troubled personal life and vilified by Republicans, the younger Biden is now also confronting the threat of felony convictions and time behind bars.\n\nThe case opening Monday with jury selection in Delaware is not about Hunter Biden's business dealings, which have been the focus of the yearslong federal investigation and Republicans' fruitless impeachment inquiry into the Democratic president. It's about a gun Hunter Biden had for about 11 days -- a .38-caliber Colt Cobra Special. Prosecutors say he bought it illegally in October 2018 because he falsely swore on a federal form that he was not a drug user. He never fired the gun, according to his lawyers, and it ended up dumped in a trash can.\n\nPeople are also reading...

And it probably will provide new political impetus for Donald Trump's allies, who are eager to distract from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's own legal problems after he was convicted of 34 felony counts in his hush money trial.\n\nAllies of Joe Biden are worried about the toll the trial may take on the president, who already is concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as that son's darkest moments are relived in public. They also are worried that the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign while facing anemic poll numbers and is scheduled to prepare in Wilmington for a June 27 debate with Trump as the trial plays out nearby.\n\nIt once looked like Hunter Biden was going to avoid prosecution in the gun case altogether.\n\nThe deal was announced last June. Nearly three years earlier, Hunter Biden had confirmed the federal investigation into his tax affairs in December 2020, shortly after his father was elected. The younger Biden would have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses; prosecutors would have recommended two years of probation. There was also a \"diversion agreement\" that would have allowed him to escape prosecution on a felony gun charge as long he stayed out of trouble for two years.\n\nBut the plea hearing quickly unraveled.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, quizzed both sides with concerns about the deal. To her, it seemed unusual and required her to be involved in the case in a way most federal judges are not. The lawyers huddled, trying to salvage the deal. At one point they could be heard yelling at each other.\n\n\"Well, we'll just rip it up!\" Chris Clark, Biden's then-attorney, shouted as tempers flared.\n\n\"So what do we do now?\" the judge later asked the lawyers.\n\n\"Then there is no deal,\" prosecutor Leo Wise told her.\n\nA few weeks later, Attorney General Merrick Garland named David Weiss, the Trump-nominated U.S. attorney in Delaware who was leading the investigation, as a special counsel.\n\nHunter Biden was indicted a month after that on three gun counts. They are punishable by up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it is unclear whether the judge would actually give him time behind bars if he were convicted.\n\nThe bitterness between prosecutors and Hunter Biden's legal team is glaring. It's likely to be on display Monday.\n\nClark withdrew from the case, saying he might be called to testify in a potential legal dispute over the now-defunct deal. Another defense lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has accused Weiss of caving to political pressure to indict the president's son after Trump and other Republicans blasted the \"sweetheart deal.\" The defense has noted that charges related to gun possession by drug users are rare when not in connection with a more serious crime.\n\n\"Mr. Biden is not being prosecuted for any sin that DOJ (the Department of Justice) believes he has committed. He is being punished for the perceived sins of his father -- the sin of opposing Mr. Trump's election to the president,\" according to court papers filed by Lowell, who also has represented Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the former president's daughter and son-in-law.\n\nProsecutors say Lowell's contention is \"fiction designed for a Hollywood script.\"\n\n\"Contrary to his assertion, he has not established that the Special Counsel, appointed by and serving at the pleasure of President Biden and his Attorney General, is punishing the defendant 'for the perceived sins of his father' in order to capitulate to a former President because of his tweets,\" Weiss' team responded.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

(Ryan Collerd/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nJury selection began on June 3 in the federal gun case against Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden, after a plea deal that would have avoided a trial and public spectacle ahead of the November election failed.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged in Delaware with three felonies related to a 2018 gun purchase. Based on testimony in his memoir, he was addicted to crack cocaine during this time and has been accused of lying to the gun dealer, making a false statement that he was not a drug user on the application to screen firearm applicants, and illegally possessing the gun for 11 days.\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden attended jury selection in person, sitting in the front row of the courtroom to support her son. President Biden released a statement saying he has \"boundless love\" for his son and \"respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" the president said.\n\n\"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean.\"\n\nMr. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to the charges. He maintains he was unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after GOP lawmakers called his failed pea deal \"special treatment\" because he's the president's son.\n\nPresident Biden added that he won't provide further comment on \"pending federal cases.\"\n\nDuring jury selection, the judge will screen prospective jurors for their impartiality by asking questions such as whether they have run for political office, donated to any political campaigns, or if their views about the 2024 presidential election will affect their decisions as jurors.\n\nThe judge will ask prospective jurors if they believe Hunter Biden is facing prosecution because of his status as the president's son. The judge will also inquire about their views on purchasing firearms while addicted to drugs, including the question, \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThis is a developing story.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Cohen_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Cohen Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Caleb_Boggs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

He will become the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be criminally tried.\n\nWhile Hunter Biden's past drug use has been well-documented, he has pleaded not guilty to the gun charges, arguing that he completed a rehab program shortly before he purchased the gun and checked off \"no\" on a federal form that asked whether he was an \"unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance.\"\n\nOn Monday, as jury selection in the trial began in Wilmington, Delaware, the first lady was seen arriving at the courthouse. According to the Post, as Hunter Biden waited for court proceedings to begin, he greeted his stepmother with a birthday joke.\n\n\"Happy birthday, I got you a special event,\" the newspaper reported him saying, adding that the two laughed.\n\nIn a post to X, formerly Twitter, Tyler Pager, a White House reporter for the Post, noted the moment his colleague Matt Viser reported the interaction and wrote, \"Quite the moment captured by \u2066@mviser\u2069 at the start of Hunter Biden's trial today.\"\n\nIn a statement emailed to Newsweek on Monday morning, President Joe Biden said while he won't comment on pending federal cases, he and the first lady support his son, adding that they commend him for his addiction recovery.\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean. As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength. Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support,\" the president said.\n\nWhile jury selection is expected to begin today, court filings submitted by Hunter Biden's legal team last week indicate that the defense intends to question the quality of the prosecution's evidence and argue that the president's son was not using illicit drugs at the time of his gun purchase, while also questioning the language used on the federal form.\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" the filing states. \"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nThe charges against Hunter Biden stem from investigations of DOJ special counsel David Weiss, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, who became the first U.S. president to be convicted of criminal charges when a New York jury found him guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records on Thursday. Trump has maintained his innocence and says the case is politically motivated. His legal team says they will fight the case, which will include an appeal, if necessary.\n\nThe trial also comes as Republicans have continued to use Hunter Biden for political attacks, attempting to tie his foreign business dealings directly to his father.\n\nPresident Biden has said he had no involvement with his son's business dealings, and the White House has called the GOP's impeachment effort \"sad, pathetic, and a waste of everyone's time.\"\n\nThe GOP's efforts in the impeachment inquiry into the president over the past year has yet to provide substantial evidence of its claims.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden and Trump are the presumptive Democratic and Republican presidential nominees respectively following a series of primary wins and are headed for a 2020 election rematch in November.

Prosecutors are expected to use his own words against him. (Scripps News)\n\nAnother election-year trial is beginning as President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden is facing federal firearms charges for allegedly buying a gun while addicted to drugs.\n\nJury selection is underway Monday morning in Wilmington, Delaware, just four days after former President Donald Trump's hush money trial ended in a conviction.\n\nHunter Biden faces three federal gun charges for a weapon he purchased in 2018. He wrote about his addiction and buying the weapon in his memoir. Prosecutors are expected to use his own words against him.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden appeared at the trial in support of Hunter Biden Monday morning.\n\nHunter Biden repeatedly tried to avoid this moment of standing trial on federal gun charges after numerous unsuccessful attempts to put the case behind him. Prosecutors said he lied on a firearms form when he bought a gun six years ago. They said he checked the box that stated he was not addicted to any drugs, when he knew that statement was false. The prosecution said the revelation was brought to light in Biden's own book, \"Beautiful Things: A Memoir.\"\n\nLast year, Biden and prosecutors had been on the brink of finalizing a plea deal, but it unexpectedly fell apart at the last minute when Judge Maryellen Noreika scrutinized the agreement.\n\nBiden has said the indictment against him is based on politics.\n\n\"I have made mistakes in my life, and wasted opportunities and privileges I was afforded. For that, I am responsible. For that, I am accountable. And for that, I am making amends,\" Biden had said in a news conference.\n\nBut the prosecution has argued that the strength of the evidence against him is overwhelming. Biden pleaded not guilty, but if he's convicted on all three counts, he could face up to 25 years behind bars.\n\nPolitics\n\nJudge denies Hunter Biden appeal to dismiss firearms case Scripps News Staff 8:58 PM, May 09, 2024\n\nThe president has not publicly commented on the merits of the case, but said he supports his son.\n\n\"I'm very proud of my son,\" President Joe Biden said.\n\nTodd Belt, a political science professor at George Washington University, said this case may have very little impact on President Biden's reelection campaign.\n\n\"One of the things we know about American people during the time of American elections is that they really don't care what spouses or friends or family members do.

First lady Jill Biden was seated in the front row of the courtroom, in a show of support for her son.\n\nIn a statement, the president said he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength\". \"I am the President, but I am also a dad,\" he said, adding that would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nHunter Biden , who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants by saying he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor, to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. While the two criminal cases are unrelated, their proximity underscores how the criminal courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nIn Delaware, prospective jurors were quizzed individually by Judge Maryellen Noreika to determine whether they could be fair and impartial. One by one, they were dismissed. Questions ranged from their knowledge of the case to their thoughts about gun ownership and whether they or anyone close to them have struggled with substance abuse or addiction or ever owned a gun. Other questions focused on the role politics may have played in the charges.\n\nOne prospective juror said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports. \"It's not a good one,\" she replied when an attorney asked her opinion. Another prospective juror was dismissed because his family has a long history in law enforcement, and he said he could not be impartial. A third was excused because he was very aware of the case, and said: \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nHunter Biden also faces a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes . Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. Lawyers could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elderly Biden, who has long been concerned about the wellbeing and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his painful mistakes are publicly scrutinized.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le

The president's son has acknowledged he was struggling with an addiction to crack cocaine when he bought a Colt Cobra revolver in October 2018.\n\nThe three counts carry a total maximum penalty of 25 years in prison, although Hunter Biden has no prior criminal record, and actual sentences tend to be lower than the maximum. He pleaded not guilty to the charges last year.\n\nThe trial will add new volatility to a US election campaign that has already been shaken by Trump's felony conviction last week. Democrats noted on Sunday that Biden will face the same judicial system that found Trump guilty in the New York hush money trial.\n\n\"Hunter Biden, of course, is entitled, as was Donald Trump, to the presumption of innocence and to a trial by a jury of his peers,\" said Hakeem Jeffries, the top Democrat in the House, on NBC's Meet the Press.\n\n\"And this justice department is going to proceed in that fashion, present the facts and the law and then we'll all have to wait for a determination that is made by a jury as to Hunter Biden's guilt or innocence.\"\n\nHouse Republicans voted six months ago to launch an impeachment inquiry probing whether Joe Biden improperly benefited from Hunter's business dealings when he was vice-president. The investigation has fizzled out without a sign that the House will vote to charge Biden with any crime.\n\nRepublicans have pointed to Hunter's gun and tax charges as Trump faces four criminal cases and a civil fraud verdict that threatens his business in New York.\n\nThe former president has denied wrongdoing and pledged to appeal the Manhattan conviction of falsifying business records to cover up \"hush money\" payments to a porn star before the 2016 election.\n\n\"We've been concentrating for six weeks on this bogus trial\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009not talking about what Hunter Biden's been up to, not talking about his upcoming trial,\" said GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake on Fox.\n\n\"They want us so distracted.\"\n\nLast year, federal prosecutors announced Hunter Biden had agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanour counts of wilful failure to pay federal income tax, and enter a \"pretrial diversion agreement\" on the gun charge. A federal judge in Delaware raised doubts about the terms of the plea deal between prosecutors and Biden, and it later collapsed.\n\nUS attorney-general Merrick Garland then named Weiss -- the US attorney in Delaware appointed by Trump -- as special counsel to oversee cases involving the president's son. The indictment added two new but related counts.\n\nWeiss then separately charged Biden with nine federal tax offences, including tax evasion, in California.

In theory, he could face a hefty jail sentence, but it is widely seen as highly unlikely. He has long struggled with addiction issues and a troubled private life.\n\nThe president's son has acknowledged struggling with an addiction to crack cocaine during that period in 2018, but his lawyers have said he didn't break the law. In his memoir Beautiful Things, he described becoming consumed by drugs and alcohol after his older brother, Beau, died in 2015 at age 46 from brain cancer. The brothers were very close, having survived a car crash when they were young that killed their mother and baby sister.\n\nHunter Biden has said he has been sober since 2019. But prosecutors intend to use his memoir to make the case that he knew he was addicted to drugs when he denied it on the form that every person must fill out when buying a gun.\n\nA plea deal aimed at avoiding a trial collapsed last year, though it is possible some form of pact could still be revived as the trial starts to play out. But one thing seen as certain this is that Republicans will use Hunter Biden's trial - and another more serious one over tax issues set for September - as a weapon to attack Joe Biden, as they have sought to do for several years.\n\nRepublicans will no doubt be motivated by Trump's host of legal travails. The former president seen as a lock to be the party's 2024 nominee was found guilty last week of falsifying business records linked to hush-money payments to adult film actor Stormy Daniels to cover an affair that was seen as potentially harming his 2016 election prospects. Like Hunter Biden, Trump too could face jail, though that also is seen as unlikely.\n\nThe timing of the trial is unfortunate for Democrats, who are seeking to highlight Trump's historic first of being the only US president to become a felon. But Joe Biden, in keeping with his reputation as a close family man, has stuck by Hunter Biden through all his troubles and that is unlikely to change during the trial which is expected to last a week or so.\n\nHowever, the trial could air potentially embarrassing family details.\n\nDavid C Weiss, special counsel overseeing the prosecution, has signaled he will call Hunter Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, to the stand. Prosecutors also may call Hallie Biden, the widow of Joe Biden's son Beau, who died of brain cancer. Hallie Biden was dating Hunter Biden when he bought a handgun in 2018.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crack cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Traffic collision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brain tumor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show_Jumping", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show Jumping", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual_Addiction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual Addiction", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8ae492353c97873dea0e3f8dd69e7d9ba38d00e/0_117_3911_2348/master/3911.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=55adb63847fd3bb69a0245fd3e9d243f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4745098039215686, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The trial stems from federal gun charges brought against him by special counsel David Weiss.\n\nHunter Biden pleaded not guilty to federal gun charges in U.S. District Court for Delaware after Weiss charged him with making a false statement in the purchase of a firearm; making a false statement related to information required to be kept by a licensed firearm dealer; and one count of possession of a firearm by a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance.\n\nWith all counts combined, the total maximum prison time for the charges could be up to 25 years. Each count carries a maximum fine of $250,000 and three years of supervised release.\n\nThe trial begins nearly a year after presiding Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned a plea deal between prosecutors and Hunter Biden, which subsequently fell apart.\n\nJUDGE BARS PROSECUTORS FROM USING SOME SALACIOUS EVIDENCE IN HUNTER BIDEN'S GUN TRIAL\n\nThe agreement, blasted as a \"sweetheart\" deal by congressional Republicans, appeared to convey broad immunity to the president's son on a host of potential criminal charges.\n\nAccording to an indictment, Hunter Biden bought a Colt Cobra revolver Oct. 12, 2018, and \"knowingly made a false and fictitious written statement, intended and likely to deceive that dealer with respect to a fact material to the lawfulness of the sale of the firearm ... certifying he was not an unlawful user of, and addicted to, any stimulant, narcotic drug, and any other controlled substance, when in fact, as he knew, that statement was false and fictitious.\"\n\nThe indictment also charges Hunter Biden with possessing that gun, which was \"shipped and transported in interstate commerce,\" for nearly a week despite being addicted to narcotics.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN IS IN COURT IN DELAWARE. HERE'S WHAT HE DOESN'T WANT THE JURY TO HEAR\n\nFox News first reported in 2021 that police had responded to an incident in 2018, when a gun owned by Hunter was thrown into a trash can outside a market in Delaware.\n\nA source with knowledge of the Oct. 23, 2018, police report told Fox News it indicated that Hallie Biden, who is the widow of President Biden's late son, Beau, and who was in a relationship with Hunter at the time, threw a gun owned by Hunter in a dumpster behind a market near a school.\n\nHallie Biden may be required to testify during Hunter Biden's trial.\n\nA firearm transaction report reviewed by Fox News indicated Hunter purchased a gun earlier that month.\n\nOn the firearm transaction report, Hunter answered in the negative when asked if he was \"an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.\"\n\nHunter was discharged from the Navy in 2014 after testing positive for cocaine.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO FEDERAL GUN CHARGES OUT OF SPECIAL COUNSEL DAVID WEISS' PROBE\n\nJudge Noreika ruled ahead of the trial that Weiss's team cannot use some salacious evidence in the first son's criminal trial, including references to the Navy discharge and his child support case for his out-of-wedlock daughter in Arkansas.\n\nNoreika also said Weiss must show Hunter Biden was addicted to drugs but not necessarily using drugs the day he purchased the gun.\n\nNoreika said the government may use part of Hunter Biden's book in which he discusses his addiction to drugs.\n\nThe prosecution does not plan to bring out the entire infamous laptop containing details of Hunter Biden's life but will introduce certain portions. Noreika ruled that Hunter Biden's team will be able to question aspects of the laptop in front of the jury. The laptop, which leaked in 2020 just before the presidential election, was decried as Russian disinformation by 51 former intelligence officials.\n\nNoreika also ruled that the special counsel cannot mention Hunter Biden's pending federal tax trial in California during the trial in Delaware, which is also part of Weiss's investigation and scheduled for a September trial.\n\nHunter Biden pleaded not guilty to those charges -- specifically, three felonies and six misdemeanors concerning $1.4 million in owed taxes that have since been paid. Weiss alleged a \"four-year scheme\" when the president's son did not pay his federal income taxes from January 2017 to October 2020 while also filing false tax reports.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN TAX TRIAL POSTPONED TO SEPTEMBER\n\nJudge Mark Scarsi heard arguments during a pre-trial hearing in California last month. That criminal trial was scheduled for June 20, but Hunter Biden's attorneys requested to delay the trial.\n\nScarsi sided with Hunter Biden's attorneys, and moved the tax trial to Sept. 5, when jury selection will begin.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brooke_singman@foxnews.com", "name": "Brooke Singman", "type": "author",

But they said a person who had just completed treatment might consider themselves sober.\n\nMore: Hunter Biden trial: Why his gun case hinges on one fateful day when he wasn't using drugs\n\nReporters arrive early for Hunter Biden trial\n\nBy 6:45 am, a dozen reporters had lined up outside the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building in downtown Wilmington for the start of Hunter Biden's will go on trial this week on federal gun charges.\n\nJury selection starts today, with court convening at 8:30 a.m. local time.\n\nThree tents for broadcast stations were set up near the court. A heavy police presence is visible, with several police cars parked along North King Street, which runs along one side the building.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security dog walked up and down the line of reporters, sniffing their bags.\n\nBoggs, the building's late namesake, was a former Republican governor who lost his Senate seat in a 1972 squeaker to Joe Biden.\n\nHunter Biden won't be able to introduce a second federal form during his trial on charges he illegally bought and possessed a gun while addicted to drugs, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika ruled Sunday.\n\nThe president's son is charged with lying on the form and lying to the gun dealer about his drug usage when he bought a .38-caliber pistol in 2018 and had it for 11 days.\n\nOn the initial form submitted to federal authorities soon after buying the gun, Biden put an X next to a question asking if he used narcotics or was addicted to them. The second version of the form was submitted to investigators in 2021 with additional information attached that said Biden submitted his vehicle registration when he bought the gun, which apparently wasn't the case, according to court statements.\n\nBiden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, sought to question the gun shop owner about the second form, arguing he apparently filled out the form inaccurately, which is the charge against Biden. But prosecutors argued the second form is \"irrelevant\" and would confuse jurors. Noreika agreed and barred the form from trial, in one of two rulings Sunday against the defense.\n\n-Xerxes Wilson\n\nMore: These are the people, places that will take center stage in Hunter Biden's trial\n\nJudge bars defense expert on drug addiction from trial\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika barred testimony from one of Hunter Biden's proposed expert witnesses, who the defense sought to give a perspective about how people suffering drug addiction view themselves.\n\nDefense lawyers sought to have Elie Aoun, an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry, to testify to testify about how people who have participated in rehabilitation programs are sometimes in denial about their addiction and view themselves as no longer addicted when they complete a program.\n\nBut Noreika barred the witness Sunday, in one of two decisions against the dense, by ruling the defense failed to provide prosecutors with a proper explanation about what expert opinions Aoun would offer.\n\nBiden's defense also sought testimony from Michael Coyer, a forensic toxicologist, to answer questions about items including a white residue on a brown leather gun pouch that tested positive for cocaine years after it was taken into police custody. Noreika ruled that she would hear from Coyer without the jury present before deciding whether to allow him to testify.\n\nThe first two relate specifically to the form he filled out to purchase a gun in 2018, accusing Biden of lying about this drug use on the form.\n\nThe third charge pertains to Biden's possession of a firearm while he was allegedly an unlawful user or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nThe charges carry a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison, though Biden is likely to get a shorter sentence if convicted. It is atypical for defendants to get a maximum sentence when they are first-time offenders like Biden.", "source": {"uri": "lohud.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Journal News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_possession_of_a_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Criminal possession of a weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Caleb_Boggs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Trial is one of two criminal cases Biden faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California\n\nJury selection kicked off in a criminal case against Hunter Biden, a historic prosecution that could further influence the 2024 presidential election four days after Joe Biden\u2019s rival Donald Trump became the first former US president to be convicted.\n\nHunter Biden, 54, arrived at the courthouse for the first trial of the child of a sitting president, in which he will face three felony charges stemming from his purchase and possession of a revolver in 2018.\n\nHunter Biden is charged with lying about his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-calibre revolver and with illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty. The case, brought by US Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California.\n\nThe judge in the gun case, Maryellen Noreika, began screening potential jurors on Monday, many of whom disclosed they had family members or acquaintances with drug problems, including one juror who became emotional when discussing a brother-in-law with an addiction.\n\nMost jurors said they were at least vaguely familiar with this case. \u201cI live in Delaware. You can\u2019t swing a cat without hearing something,\u201d one potential juror told the judge.\n\nFew jurors expressed strong political views.\n\nOne said he had worked with First Lady Jill Biden and said he had met \u201cJill\u2019s husband\u201d multiple times. He also said he supported the campaign of Ferris Wharton, who ran unsuccessfully for Delaware attorney general against Beau Biden, Hunter\u2019s brother, who died of cancer in 2015.\n\nAll 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nJill Biden, Hunter Biden\u2019s wife Melissa Cohen Biden and his half-sister Ashley Biden were at the trial in Wilmington, before US District Judge Maryellen Noreika.\n\n\u201cJill and I love our son and we are so proud of the man he is today,\u201d Joe Biden said in a statement, adding that a lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction.\n\nThe trial comes days after Trump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 US election that put him in the White House. Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the November 5 US election.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump\u2019s legal troubles. Trump is expected to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the US Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday. The president, who had been expected to depart Rehoboth Beach on Monday, travelled on Sunday evening to his home in Wilmington.\n\nThe case is expected to centre on Hunter Biden\u2019s years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, Beautiful Things. He told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for \u201cno\u201d next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nProsecution lawyers revealed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter Biden\u2019s phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers. They said they may call as a witness his former wife Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s lawyers have indicated they may try to show he had completed a drug rehabilitation programme before buying the gun and may have considered his answer on the gun purchase form to be truthful.\n\nA plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Biden. Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers blamed Republican pressure for the failure of the plea agreement.\n\nNoreika entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden\u2019s legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden\u2019s legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.\n\nThat testimony could have helped Biden show that he did not know he was lying on the background check form. The government is required to prove that Biden knowingly lied.\n\nCongressional Republicans spent years in vain trying to find evidence of a corrupt link between Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business dealings, including work for Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and his father\u2019s political power.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"},

He is charged with two counts related to false statements in purchasing the firearm and a third count of illegally obtaining a firearm while addicted to drugs.\n\nBut Hunter Biden's legal team believes it can throw a wrench in Weiss' tidy narrative. At a recent pretrial hearing, an attorney for Biden suggested the firearm form at the heart of the case was \"much more complicated than [the] special counsel indicates it is.\"\n\nMORE: Special counsel plans to use infamous laptop as evidence in Hunter Biden's firearm trial\n\nJury selection for the trial is set to begin on Monday. And if 12 Delaware residents accept the government's story, the president's only living son could face a prison sentence.\n\nThe task of fighting that outcome falls to Abbe Lowell, a veteran defense attorney who has represented several other high-profile figures, including Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.\n\nHow Lowell plans to fight the charges remains somewhat unclear. He has signaled to U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika that the contours of his case would depend in large part on how prosecutors proceed at trial.\n\nBut in court records and at pretrial hearings, he has offered some tea leaves -- and suggested he will attempt to cast doubt on some of the government's most crucial evidence and witnesses.\n\n'Tampered' or 'annotated'?\n\nLowell has, for example, latched onto revelations in court that two copies exist of the federal gun form at the heart of the case, called an ATF Form 4473. A shop employee created the original document when Hunter Biden purchased the firearm in 2018. It lists Biden's passport as the ID he presented to the shop employee.\n\nYears later, however, a copy was made. The copy included a handwritten note, \"DE Vehicle Registration,\" on a line left blank for \"Supplemental Government Issued Documentation.\" Store employees did so in 2021 to rectify a requirement that gun buyers present a form of ID that includes an address, which passports do not.\n\nLowell contends that gun store employees \"tampered with\" the document, and that it raises questions about \"who wrote what on the form, and when.\"\n\nWeiss' office has said the gun shop employees merely \"annotated\" the document. But they took Lowell's argument seriously enough to re-interview the gun store owner, Ronald Palimere, on May 16.\n\nDuring the interview, according to notes filed on the case docket, Palimere said Hunter Biden's legal tribulations were becoming \"a big scandal and there was intense attention on the incident,\" and that employees at the store \"were all scared to death.\"\n\nPalimere \"felt it was necessary to annotate the Form 4473 because he felt they were going to get in trouble just for going up against Biden,\" according to the notes.\n\nIf jurors are persuaded by Lowell's tack, the argument could undermine the credibility of some key government witnesses -- the people who sold Biden the gun -- and potentially create a reasonable doubt that Hunter Biden was the one who actually checked that box.\n\nAt least two gun store employees, including Palimere, are expected to testify at the trial.\n\nThe definition of 'is'\n\nLowell may also advance the argument that Hunter Biden may have been confused by the language on the ATF Form 4473. The box he checked \"no\" asked of the buyer, \"Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to\" various narcotics.\n\n\"The issue here is Mr. Biden's understanding of the question, which asks in the present tense if he 'is' a user or addict,\" Lowell wrote in court papers.\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" he continued. \"Someone like Mr. Biden, who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nMORE: Special counsel in Hunter Biden case plans to call his ex-wife, brother's widow as witnesses in upcoming trial\n\nFinally, Lowell has raised \"an issue of chain of custody\" with a leather pouch that allegedly held the revolver Hunter Biden purchased. In court documents filed earlier this year, prosecutors said this pouch had cocaine residue on it.\n\nAfter purchasing the firearm in 2018, Hunter Biden possessed it for less than two weeks before his then-romantic partner, Hallie Biden - who is also the widow of his brother, Beau - discovered the weapon and the pouch, discarded them in a dumpster.\n\nThe gun was soon recovered by the authorities, but the pouch was not tested for drug residue until five years later, in 2023. Lowell said at the pretrial hearing that he wants to question witnesses about what happened to the pouch during those five years when it was in police custody to see if it was \"tampered with.\"\n\nOne of the witnesses Lowell plans to call for the defense is a chemical residue expert.\n\nThe government's case\n\nProsecutors hope these arguments fall flat, and that jurors rely on the voluminous evidence they plan to present to find Hunter Biden guilty of committing the three felony charges he faces.\n\nProsecutors seem poised to use Hunter Biden's own words against him -- excerpts from his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" and text messages he exchanged around the time of the gun purchase -- to demonstrate that he was in fact a drug user when he filled out the ATF Form 4473 and procured the weapon.\n\nIn one text message prosecutors included in court filings, Hunter Biden wrote two days after allegedly purchasing the gun: \"I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney,\" referring to an intersection in Wilmington.\n\nWeiss' office also plans to show jurors the original ATF Form 4473, in which Biden represented that \"he was not an unlawful user of, or addicted to, any stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance\" -- despite allegedly knowing it not to be true.\n\nProsecutors indicated that they plan to call as many as 12 witnesses, including Hallie Biden and Hunter Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle.\n\nMORE: Judge denies Hunter Biden's attempt to dismiss federal gun charges\n\nLowell has not yet decided whether Hunter Biden will testify in his own defense.\n\nThe trial begins on Monday and is expected to last two to three weeks. If he's found guilty, Biden could face a prison sentence of up to 25 years, though legal experts suggest that, as a first-time and nonviolent offender, he would not likely serve time.\n\nWeiss' office also charged Hunter Biden in December with nine felony and misdemeanor charges stemming from his failure to pay $1.4 million in taxes for three years during a time when he was in the throes of addiction. The back taxes and penalties were eventually paid in full by a third party, identified by ABC News as Hunter Biden's attorney and confidant, Kevin Morris. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nThe trial in that case was scheduled to begin on June 20 in California, but Lowell successfully petitioned the judge to postpone it until Sept. 5 -- raising the likelihood that a jury could be deliberating whether to convict the president's son on several felony counts in the waning weeks of the 2024 election.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

'I am the President, but I am also a Dad,' Biden said. 'Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.'\n\nThe president and first lady - who appeared alongside Hunter in court Monday - arrived back to their Wilmington, Delaware home a night early from their Rehoboth Beach escape. Jury selection kicked off Monday morning in the case, as Hunter is charged with lying about his sobriety on a form to purchase a handgun, a federal offense.\n\n'Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us,' the president continued. 'A lot of families have loved one who have overcome addiction and know what we mean.' Hunter chronicled in his 2021 memoir Beautiful Things his addiction to alcohol and crack cocaine and credited his second wife Melissa Cohen for helping him get sober. Melissa walked hand-in-hand with Hunter into court Monday morning.\n\nSister Ashley was also on hand, as well as Naomi Biden's husband Peter Neal. The president remained in Wilmington - and will fly to Connecticut for a fundraiser later Monday - but did not show up at the courthouse with other family members. 'As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength,' Biden continued.\n\n'Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our live and support.' Hunter's addiction spiraled out of control after the 2015 death of his brother Beau Biden to brain cancer.\n\nHe purchased a gun in 2018 during a period of heavy drug use - which he wrote about in Beautiful Things. The younger Biden stands accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants whe he said he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHunter has pleaded not guilty. He said he is being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans complained about a 'sweetheart' plea deal that the first son had entered into - a deal that fell apart last summer.\n\nHunter was indicted on gun charges in September. The case directly follows the dramatic conclusion to former President Donald Trump's hush money case.\n\nThe former president was indicted Thursday on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to hide payments to Stormy Daniels.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

But in 2021, gun store employees made a copy that included some handwritten notes. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell contended that employees had \"tampered with\" the document, and that it raised questions about \"who wrote what on the form, and when.\"\n\nLowell hoped his argument would undermine the credibility of some key government witnesses -- the people who sold Biden the gun -- and potentially create a reasonable doubt that Hunter Biden was the one who actually checked that box.\n\nAttorneys for special counsel David Weiss' office have said the gun shop employees merely \"annotated\" the form and urged Noreika to prevent Lowell from introducing it into evidence.\n\nJury selection is scheduled to get underway today in the federal gun trial of Hunter Biden, who authorities say broke the law when he purchased a Colt revolver in 2018.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's son faces two counts of making false statements while purchasing the firearm and a third count of illegally obtaining it while addicted to drugs.\n\nAlthough the charges together carry a possible sentence of up to 25 years, legal experts say that, as a first-time and nonviolent offender, Hunter Biden would not likely serve time if convicted.\n\nThe trial, in Delaware federal court, is expected to last two to three weeks.", "source": {"uri": "mycentraloregon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyCentralOregon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Will they pull away from Trump as he awaits sentencing, or rally behind him in the belief he was unfairly prosecuted?\n\nIn Hunter Biden's trial, the electorate isn't so much the issue. Voters aren't likely to blame Biden even if his son is convicted, polling shows. More than half credited Biden with being a good father by supporting his son through myriad legal difficulties, a Reuters-Ipsos survey in January showed.\n\nA bigger question is whether Hunter Biden's fate will distract or distress a sitting president in the throes of a tough re-election bid. The son's trial is the father's as well, in that sense, testing Joe Biden's focus and mental discipline during a pivotal stretch of his presidency.\n\nSoon after the trial gets underway, Biden will leave for his first overseas trip of the year. He'll give a speech in France on Thursday marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings that led to the allied victory in World War II.\n\nLater in the week, he'll meet privately with French President Emmanuel Macron, where they are expected to discuss a grinding war between Russia and Ukraine that has cost U.S. taxpayers $175 billion.\n\nBiden will return to Europe midmonth for a summit meeting in Italy with America's closest democratic allies, and at the end of June he'll take part in his first debate with Trump.\n\n\"He has always put his family at the center of his life,\" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a friend of the president's, said in an interview. \"He will be able to do both. He has shown for decades an ability to both tend to difficult and pressing family needs and carry out his office.\"\n\nThe Bidens are a family drawn close by tragedy. Hunter Biden and his brother Beau were both seriously injured in a car crash in 1972 that killed their mother and baby sister, just weeks after Joe Biden won his first Senate bid.\n\nBeau Biden died of brain cancer at age 46 in 2015, leaving what Hunter Biden described in his 2021 memoir as a \"hole that was hard to fill.\" He used the book to describe a crack cocaine addiction that could have killed him.\n\n\"It will likely be very personal and very painful,\" an adviser to the president said of of Hunter Biden's trial.\n\nIn the run-up to the trial, the two have been virtually inseparable. Privately, some Biden allies have questioned whether it's smart for Biden to give his son a public platform that makes the entire family a target for GOP attacks. Yet if anything, Biden wrapped himself around Hunter more tightly ahead of the trial.\n\nThe younger Biden was a guest at a state dinner at the White House on May 23 for the visiting president of Kenya.\n\nHe joined his father and other family members on Thursday as they visited Beau's gravesite in Wilmington on the ninth anniversary of his death. The next day, Hunter Biden joined his father on Air Force One as they flew to Washington.\n\nOn Saturday, as the president bicycled during his stay at his Rehoboth Beach home in Delaware, his son cycled behind him, according to a White House press pool report.\n\nMichael LaRosa, a former spokesman for first lady Jill Biden, said that \"the Bidens are remarkably normal parents and when their kids are hurting, they're hurting, too.\"\n\n\"Biden communicates daily and directly with his children and I would not expect that to change during the trial,\" LaRosa added. \"This is a father and son who have had an especially close relationship their entire lives, and based on how often they talk to and rely on each other, I expect the president will always be in the loop on the developments, no matter where he physically is in the world.\"\n\nThe Biden and Trump campaigns are taking vastly different approaches to the trial. Trump's team is drawing an equivalence between the ex-president's predicament and that of Hunter Biden. In a Fox News appearance on Thursday after the verdict, Trump spokesman Jason Miller was asked what Trump would say if Biden were to start calling his rival a \"convicted felon.\"\n\n\"Where's Hunter?\" Miller replied.\n\nBiden allies say they aren't worried about that line of attack. \"Where's Hunter?\" was a Trump mantra during the 2020 campaign. Yet Trump lost.\n\n\"It hasn't stuck. So, it doesn't strike me as likely that a trial of Hunter Biden in a crowded media environment will break through,\" said Dmitri Mehlhorn, a Democratic strategist and fundraiser.\n\nAs the trial unfolds, the Biden campaign plans to keep quiet. There won't be any rapid-response statements coming from the Wilmington headquarters about developments inside the federal courthouse, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nOne of Biden's aims is to show that he's not abusing presidential powers by meddling in independent law enforcement investigations. He said little about Trump's case until the verdict was rendered. Though he told MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle last year that his son had \"done nothing wrong,\" he wants to avoid any impression that he's trying to influence the outcome one way or another, Biden advisers said.\n\nA hands-off approach could also help undercut Trump's claim that Biden has weaponized the justice system to sway the election.\n\n\"Maybe this [Hunter Biden's trial] addresses all those Trump disciples who believe that the federal government is out to get Donald Trump,\" said Alan Kessler, a Philadelphia-based attorney and longtime Democratic fundraiser. \"If anything, it levels the playing field and shows there is not some great conspiracy by the government to just go after Donald Trump.\"\n\nHunter Biden was indicted in September on three counts involving possession of a gun while using narcotics. He has pleaded not guilty. The trial may feature moments of personal drama and anguish. Prosecutors have been permitted to delve into Hunter Biden's past drug use. They are expected to call as witnesses his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle, as well as Beau Biden's widow, Hallie Olivere Biden.\n\nA hope among Biden advisers is that voters prove sympathetic to Hunter Biden's struggle with addiction, a nationwide scourge. In 2022, the most recent year in which data was available, nearly 49 million people in the U.S. over the age of 12 had a \"substance use disorder\" involving alcohol or drugs, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nMany voters have struggled with drug or alcohol dependence and should be able to empathize with what the Bidens have endured, said a Democratic fundraiser who is close to the Biden campaign.\n\n\"Twenty-five years ago, this might have been scandalous. But things have changed,\" this person said, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely. Voters are more accepting of \"imperfect families\" and don't tend \"to look down on them and think he [Joe Biden] must be a bad dad.\"\n\nA verdict in the case doesn't end the Hunter Biden saga. In September, he is scheduled to go on trial in California in a separate case involving tax charges. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nBiden aides are anxious about the timing of the tax trial. It will happen just two months before the election and may spill into the early-voting period in some states.\n\nThough Trump was indicted in three other cases, he isn't expected to face any more trials before the election. That could set up an unhelpful split screen, as Biden's advisers see it: Trump will be out campaigning, while the president's son will be sitting in a courtroom defending himself against charges that he failed to pay taxes.\n\nBut a focus group conducted in December with swing voters in North Carolina suggests that people may be forgiving. When the moderator asked one woman whether she was troubled by Hunter's indictment on tax charges, she replied: \"No.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" the moderator asked in the focus group conducted by Engagious/Sago as part of its Swing Voter Project.\n\n\"He's not the president,\" she said. \"I'm not voting for him.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors":

Below is a look at the key moments leading up to the trial, the first for a child of a sitting president.\n\nMay 13, 2014: Burisma Group, a private energy company in Ukraine, said Hunter Biden would be joining its board. Joe Biden is vice president and oversees Ukraine policy for the administration of President Barack Obama. Burisma's founder was the subject of a series of criminal investigations by Ukrainian authorities, which would be closed in 2017 after company and founder made payments to authorities.\n\nMay 30, 2015: Joe Biden's oldest of two sons, Beau Biden, dies of cancer. Hunter Biden would later write in his autobiography, Beautiful Things, it set off his descent into addiction.\n\nOct. 12, 2018: Hunter Biden purchases a Colt Cobra .38 Special revolver and on the federal firearm purchase form, he responded \"no\" to a question if he was an unlawful user of controlled substances or an addict. Later that month his sister-in-law threw it in a public trash bin where it was discovered by a man collecting recyclables and turned over to police.\n\n2019: U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware, David Weiss, begins investigating Hunter Biden for potential tax and other financial crimes, according to media reports. Weiss was appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nApril 2019: Joe Biden announces his bid for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. Hunter Biden's term on the Burisma board expires.\n\nJuly 25, 2019: President Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and pressured him to investigate an allegation that Joe Biden, while in office, muscled the Ukrainian authorities to shut down a probe that could implicate Hunter Biden's work for Burisma. The Bidens denied the allegations. The U.S. House of Representatives would later impeach Trump over the call although the Senate voted against removing Trump from power.\n\nJune 20, 2023: Hunter Biden reaches a deal to plead guilty to two misdemeanor charges of willfully failing to pay income taxes and to enter into an agreement to avert a conviction on gun-related charges. The agreement sparked accusations by Republicans that Hunter Biden was receiving favorable treatment as the president's son.\n\nJuly 26, 2023: U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika said she can't accept a plea deal that Hunter Biden worked out with prosecutors because of concerns it was overly broad and insulated him from other potential business-related charges.\n\nSept. 14, 2023: Hunter Biden is charged in Delaware for gun-related crimes and faces up to 25 years in prison. He denies the accusations and later enters a not guilty plea.\n\nDec. 8, 2023: Hunter Biden is charged with federal tax crimes in Los Angeles and he will later plead not guilty. His lawyer Abbe Lowell accuses Weiss, who led the probe, of political bias.\n\nJune 3, 2024: Jury selection begins in Wilmington, Delaware over the gun-related charges. The trial could last more than two weeks according to the parties.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; Editing by Nick Zieminski)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news",

The trial is set to begin with jury selection on Monday at 8:30am in Delaware (12:30 GMT).This is the first time that a child of a sitting president will be a criminal defendant, coming shortly after another historic first: the trial of a former US president, after Donald Trump went to court over a vase centred on hush money he paid adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump was convicted in the case on Thursday.\n\nHere is more about the upcoming Hunter Biden trial:\n\nWhat are the charges against Hunter Biden?\n\nThe younger Biden, 54, faces a three-count indictment over making false statements about his drug use to buy a gun back in 2018.\n\nHis indictment was filed on September 14, 2023 and brought by US Special Counsel David Weiss after a plea deal between Hunter Biden and Weiss imploded in July 2023. The deal would have erased gun charges in exchange for Biden pleading guilty to two tax charges. Under the deal, Biden would have avoided prison.\n\nIn October 2018, Hunter Biden purchased a Colt Cobra .38 special revolver from a gun shop called StarQuest Shooters & Survival Supply in Wilmington, Delaware -- a town that the Bidens call home.\n\nDelaware gun laws allow adults to purchase and own guns, but federal law requires the person seeking to purchase to fill out a Firearm Transaction Record form, or ATF Form 4473. The form requires details such as height, weight, birth date and declarations such as whether the purchaser is in the country unlawfully, has been convicted of a felony or admitted to a mental institution in the past.\n\nAmong t ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_false_statements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Making false statements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_Cobra", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colt Cobra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_possession_of_a_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal possession of a weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_4473", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Form 4473"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.38_Special", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": ".38 Special"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatric hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revolver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_law_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gun law in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-09-", "textStart": 789, "textEnd": 801}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-", "textStart": 1076, "textEnd": 1088}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

The proceeding will include testimony by a former Delaware State Police official who investigated that incident, as well as the person who trashed the gun: Biden's then-lover and widow of his late brother.\n\nIt will also include testimony from workers from a gun store on U.S. 202 in Talleyville, Delaware, a shop that now finds itself at the center of criticisms by Hunter Biden's defense attorneys for seemingly committing a similar paperwork infraction that led to Biden's criminal charges.\n\nIt all started with an odd incident involving Hunter Biden and Hallie Biden at Janssen's in October 2018, an incident that would escape the public eye for years.\n\nHow did Hunter Biden's gun end up in the trash?\n\nA Delaware State Police investigative report from 2018 included in court filings details the investigation into the incident, as well as interviews with Hunter Biden and Hallie Biden - the widow of Hunter Biden's brother, the late Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden. At the time of the Janssen's incident, she was Hunter Biden's lover.\n\nThe police report isn't clear on who summoned State Police to the grocery store, though it appears from the redacted copy included in court documents that it was a store employee. Police arrived and found Hallie Biden in the store's office. She told officers she took her children to school that morning and returned home and searched Hunter Biden's vehicle, locating the handgun in the center console.\n\nShe put it in a bag and later drove to Janssen's and threw the bag and the gun in the trash outside the store, she told officers. Hunter Biden had left by the time she returned and she called him to confront him about the gun. She said Hunter Biden became upset and implored her to drive back and retrieve it.\n\nBut when she returned, the gun was no longer in the trash. She got nervous and approached the store owner to confess. The officer wrote that Hallie Biden \"danced around\" questions about why she searched Hunter Biden's car and later stated she thought he was \"screwing around on me.\"\n\n\"She was kind of all over the place,\" the officer wrote.\n\nRecent: Hunter Biden trial begins Monday in Wilmington: What you need to know about the case\n\nIn the presence of the officers, she then called Hunter Biden and told him the officer wished to speak to him. He arrived half an hour later.\n\nHe told the officer he was in a relationship with Hallie Biden, sometimes stayed at her home nearby but still lived in Washington D.C. He claimed he woke up at her home that morning and began to drive to Washington D.C. when he noticed the gun was missing and he called Hallie Biden, who admitted to tossing the gun in the trash.\n\nHe said he purchased it for target practice but had not shot it. The officer wrote that he told Hunter Biden that Hallie Biden was not very forthcoming and asked him if the gun had been used in a crime.\n\n\"He became very agitated with me and asked if I was intentionally trying to make him mad,\" the officer wrote.\n\nBiden also asked whether he should call an attorney. The officer emphasized that his interest was simply in locating the gun to protect children, as A.I. du Pont High School is right across the street.\n\nAttention then focused on who might have retrieved the gun from the trash.\n\nHunter Biden told him Hallie Biden had mentioned noticing a \"homeless man\" collecting cans and speculated he may have the gun. Employees of the store and officers said they had also noticed the man in the past.\n\nThe officer wrote that two \"Mexican males\" then passed them wearing Janssen's Market shirts and Hunter Biden stated \"they have some shady people working at the market\" and referred to the men as \"prolly illegal.\"\n\nThe officer later asked if he had told his father about this. Hunter Biden said, \"I have never called my dad for anything.\" He also speculated that Hallie Biden searched his car because she was worried he might harm himself.\n\nEventually, officers would focus on finding the man known for plundering the grocery store's garbage.\n\nHow did officers find Hunter Biden's gun?\n\nAbout a week later, officers were able to locate the man with the help of a worker at another local store that the man frequented. They watched as he spent about an hour rummaging through trash receptacles in the Greenville Crossing Shopping Center and approached as he loaded the loot into the back of his car.\n\nHe told them he routinely collects recyclables to trade for cash when he goes to New York. Conversation then turned to someone putting something in the trash that shouldn't have been there recently.\n\n\"Yes, they did,\" the man responded. \"A .38 special.\"\n\nRecent: What is an 'addict'? Hunter Biden is fighting what that means as gun trial looms\n\nHe then took officers back to his home where he had stashed the gun in a sock inside a box. The officer wrote that the man could not provide a reason why he didn't report the gun to police, but told them he would alert authorities if he ever came across another in the trash.\n\nHe also gave officers another gun that he said his co-worker had given him many years ago with the understanding that it belonged to his co-worker's brother, \"who was in some kind of trouble and needed to get rid of the gun,\" according to the police report.\n\nThe officer called Hunter Biden to report the gun's recovery and wrote that Hunter Biden was firm that there should be no prosecution in the case.\n\n\"The whole thing is just stupid,\" the officer quotes Hunter Biden saying.\n\nProsecutors in the Delaware Department of Justice were consulted and decided the case didn't warrant any sort of criminal prosecution, according to the police report.\n\nIn addition to testimony from Hallie Biden, Millard Greer, a former state police officer who authored the final investigative report on the incident included in court files, is expected to testify. He has since taken a job as an investigator in the Delaware Department of Justice unit tasked with policing public corruption.\n\nWere the Secret Service involved?\n\nThis incident was first reported by the conservative news website The Blaze in 2020. Their report was built on anonymous law enforcement sources.\n\nPolitico followed up on the story with a leaked copy of the Delaware State Police report, a document typically kept secret by state officials and shielded by Delaware's restrictive public records law. The Politico story focused on a curious ripple: both state police investigators, as well as the Secret Service, had contacted the Delaware gun shop about the paperwork Hunter Biden filled out in purchasing the gun.\n\nThis was odd because Joe Biden was in between his term as Vice President and becoming the Democratic nominee for president, so he and his family were not under Secret Service protection, Politico reported.\n\nIn a recent interview with federal authorities, the owner of the gun shop reiterated that both State Police and the Secret Service separately contacted him shortly after Hunter Biden's gun had gone missing. He said they seemed to not be aware of the other's investigation. In the interview, the owner said the request from the Secret Service \"didn't feel right\" so he only gave the form to State Police investigators at the time.\n\nWhy is the Brandywine Hundred gun store StarQuest Shooters involved?\n\nWhile the trash can incident explains how the gun purchase came to the attention of federal investigators, it was the actual purchase that has Hunter Biden facing the potential of decades in prison.\n\nThe gun, a Colt .38 special revolver, was purchased from StarQuest Shooters & Survival Supply store on Concord Pike in October 2018, a few weeks before the Janssen's incident.\n\nThe store is owned by Ron Palimere, who through the years has been quoted in Delaware Online/The News Journal about gun safety laws and doomsday prep. Attempts to reach him through the store and his email were unsuccessful.\n\nProsecutors intend to call another employee of the store, Gordon Cleveland, to testify about the transaction with Hunter Biden. Cleveland is expected to testify that he watched Hunter Biden fill out what is known as ATF form 4473. On it, prosecutors contend that Hunter Biden stated that he was not an unlawful user of or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nProsecutors contend that statement is false and it is the foundation of two of the criminal charges against Hunter Biden.\n\nMeanwhile, Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden's primary defense attorney, last week signaled his intent to call Palimere to the stand to discuss differences between a copy of the ATF form emailed to federal authorities shortly after the purchase and the original that federal officials took possession of three years later.\n\nThe original that federal officials took possession of more recently had additions including \"DE Vehicle Registration\" written into a box for supplemental government-issued documentation. There were no alleged changes to the specific portion that Hunter Biden filled out.\n\nWhy was the form edited?\n\nLowell noted the \"doctored\" form in a pretrial hearing earlier this month, prompting prosecutors and FBI agents to interview Palimere and include a transcript in court filings seeking to keep what they describe as the \"annotated\" form out of evidence.\n\nPalimere told agents that he also owned a consignment store next door and believed he was called from there to the gun shop when employees recognized Biden as a \"celebrity-type customer.\"\n\nHe remained in the back of the store and the salesman said Biden wanted to use his passport for identification, not a driver's license, which is typical. Passports don't typically contain a person's home address, but Palmiere blessed the use of the passport, according to the interview report.\n\n\"Palimere was familiar with Biden's father's not being a gun supporter so Palimere thought it would be bad for Palimere's business to have Hunter Biden seen in his store,\" the report states. \"Palimere wanted to get the sale completed and get Biden out of the store.\"\n\nHe added that the fact that the \"Biden family home was so well known\" and his lack of knowledge about the details of a passport caused him to have incomplete information on the form. He didn't handle the form for three years until a federal agent requested the original be turned over.\n\nAfter he was contacted, he reviewed the form and another employee brought up that it needed to be annotated.\n\n\"Palimere decided to write Delaware registration in the box,\" the interview summation states. \"Palimere does not know why that was chosen but he knew it had to be an official document and it was all they could think of.\"\n\nIt adds that Palimere told authorities he doesn't think that Hunter Biden actually showed his vehicle registration the day he bought the gun. The interview report notes that federal authorities allow for forms to be annotated after the fact, which would typically involve calling the customer and having them show documents regarding their residency.\n\n\"Palimere was not about to call Biden. Palimere felt they could not have him come into the store,\" the report states. \"Plus, Palimere did not want to contact Biden and tell him he needed to come in and he was being investigated.\"\n\nLowell has sought to make the annotation a feature of Hunter Biden's defense.\n\nIn arguing for the edited form to be admitted, he said it speaks to the credibility of those testifying that Hunter Biden filled out the form and is also relevant to explore any benefit the witnesses received by prosecutors disregarding potentially incorrect information they put on the form.\n\nIn arguing to keep the edited form out of evidence, prosecutors argued it would confuse the jury and changes to the form after the fact are not relevant.\n\nAs of Friday, Presiding Judge Maryellen Norieka had not ruled whether the annotated form will be allowed into evidence.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

(This has understandably been overshadowed by a certain other milestone from last week.) The government alleges that Hunter illegally purchased and possessed a firearm while being an active drug user, and he faces three felony counts overall, which prosecutors pursued after a planned plea deal focused on separate tax charges fell apart in spectacular fashion. Hunter, who has been open about his struggles with addiction, has also long been at the center of Republican investigations that have unsuccessfully attempted to draw a link between him, President Joe Biden, and alleged illicit foreign business dealings. With Hunter's trial underway, here is a refresher on the case.\n\nIn September 2023, a federal grand jury indicted Biden on three federal firearm charges, including making false statements while purchasing a weapon and possession of a firearm by a drug user or addict. Two of the counts are connected to paperwork that Biden filled out while purchasing a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver at a Wilmington, Delaware, gun store in 2018. The indictment alleges that Biden knowingly lied on the forms about his drug use, asserting that he \"was not an unlawful user of, or addicted to, any stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.\" The final count pertains to Biden possessing a firearm as a drug user, which is forbidden under federal law. During his arraignment in early January, Biden entered a not-guilty plea. He faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison.\n\nIn June 2023, Biden struck a deal with federal prosecutors in which he would plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges, stemming from his failure to pay more than a million dollars in income tax on time. In exchange, he would avoid a felony gun charge related to the 2018 gun-store purchase. But the deal collapsed in dramatic fashion during a July 2023 hearing when Judge Maryellen Noreika, a Trump appointee, raised questions about the details, particularly regarding Hunter's future immunity status. With both sides unable to align on the deal's particulars, it fell apart.\n\nIn August 2023, Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed David Weiss, the U.S. Attorney for Delaware who had been overseeing the investigation into Biden, as special counsel in the matter. Some congressional Republicans, many of whom called for a special-counsel inquiry into Biden, were quick to denounce Weiss's appointment. \"David Weiss can't be trusted and this is just a new way to whitewash the Biden family's corruption,\" read a social-media post from the House Judiciary Committee Republicans.\n\nAfter he took over, two federal grand juries returned charges against the younger Biden in the following months. In addition to the firearm counts, Biden was indicted on multiple tax charges in December 2023 with prosecutors alleging he \"engaged in a four-year scheme\" in which he didn't pay at least $1.4 million in federal taxes he owed from 2016 to 2019 and filed false returns on his 2018 taxes. Biden has pleaded not guilty to those charges and is set to go on trial for them in California in September.\n\nPresident Biden has remained strongly supportive of Hunter, though he has largely refrained from commenting on the particulars of his son's legal issues. In a statement issued Monday morning, Biden said, \"As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength. Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\"\n\nBiden and First Lady Jill Biden traveled to Wilmington the night before the trial was set to begin. Mrs. Biden was in attendance at court on Monday, which was also her 73rd birthday.", "source": {"uri": "nymag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NYMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nia_prater@nymag.com",

(AP) -- President Joe Biden's son Hunter arrived at court on Monday for jury selection in a federal gun case against him after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden arrived shortly after, entering the courthouse in support of her son.\n\nJoe Biden said that as president he wouldn't comment on the criminal trial but as a dad he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said in a statement. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first at the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court to support him.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nLong reported from Washington.

Now Hunter Biden's Gun Trial Is Set to Start - BNN Bloomberg", "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Hunter Biden is set to become the first child of a sitting US president tried for crimes, just days after the historic guilty verdict against Donald Trump -- two events that may inject fresh uncertainty into the 2024 election.\n\nJury selection begins Monday in the first of two cases Hunter Biden has tried to avoid for years, both to stay out of prison and spare his father, President Joe Biden, political and personal turmoil as he runs for a second term most likely against Trump.\n\nThe trial in Wilmington, Delaware, on three federal gun violations is expected to plumb the depths of the younger Biden's drug use. During that period, prosecutors allege he lied about his substance abuse on a federal form to illegally purchase a firearm.\n\nSpecial Counsel David Weiss has indicated he plans to raise painful events from the Biden family's past related to Hunter's conduct and events that involve the president. Still, White House officials largely view the trial as a private matter for Biden's son tied to his personal behavior from years ago.\n\nThe president, who is expected to travel to France during part of the trial, will be monitoring it primarily as a concerned parent who has supported his son's recovery from addiction, according to a person familiar with his thinking.\n\nThere are no plans for the White House to publicly engage with the trial, said the person, who requested anonymity to discuss how the president and his staff view the legal matter. But those plans could change, and the person did not rule out the possibility of the president reacting to developments in real time.\n\nPlea Possibility\n\nWhile the possibility exists for a last-minute plea deal between the two sides, Hunter Biden's legal team is prepared to argue the charges are unconstitutional and violate the Second Amendment, as well as point out flaws in the government's evidence.\n\nDick Harpootlian, a Biden ally and former South Carolina prosecutor, said jurors in Biden's home state might wonder why prosecutors brought the criminal case against him now that he's shaken his drug addiction.\n\n\"It only takes one for a hung jury, and I can definitely see one or more jurors questioning the propriety of bringing this case,\" said Harpootlian, who now serves as a state senator.\n\nBiden's trial represents another highly politicized spectacle following the former President Trump's criminal trial in New York, which ended Thursday with his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up an affair with a porn star during the 2016 race.\n\nHunter Biden also has been charged by Weiss in Los Angeles for nine federal tax violations and is scheduled to go on trial in that case in September.\n\nThe gun trial is expected to be short but dramatic, with prosecutors airing details about Hunter Biden's drug-laden years that include excerpts from a book he wrote about it, Beautiful Things: A Memoir.\n\n\"His book is replete with admissions that establish he knew he was an addict and knew he was using crack cocaine throughout 2018, including in October 2018 when he purchased and possessed the gun,\" prosecutors wrote in a May 20 trial brief.\n\nFordham University law professor Cheryl Bader, an ex-assistant US attorney who now runs the school's criminal-law clinic, said Biden's chances of winning an acquittal are slim given his acknowledgment in his memoir.\n\nBiden has been open about his struggles with alcohol and drugs but said he has remained sober since mid-2019.\n\nFederal prosecutors \"only bring cases that they are confident they can win, and they are known for dotting their I's and crossing their T's,\" Bader said.\n\nTwo of the gun counts carry maximum prison time of 10 years; another is punishable by as much as five years. However, judges rarely impose maximum sentences.\n\nBiden's lawyers plan to challenge the government's charge that he bought the gun while a drug addict as constitutionally vague. They are set to argue that he wasn't using drugs when he bought the gun. They also plan to contend that the seller didn't comply with legal requirements in the gun sale and documentation.\n\n\"Intoxication from too much alcohol or using drugs, legal or illegal, may make it too dangerous for people to drive a car, operate heavy machinery, or possess a firearm one day, but they may be perfectly sober enough to do all those things the next day,\" according to a May 23 trial brief by Biden's lawyers.\n\nWeiss was nominated by Trump to serve as the US attorney for Delaware and kept on by Biden. He was appointed as a special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2023 to manage the cases against Hunter Biden.\n\nBiden and Weiss had agreed to a plea deal last year to resolve both allegations, but the agreement fell apart under questioning by the federal judge overseeing the case. Biden's lawyers and supporters have argued that Weiss then bowed to political pressure by Trump and conservatives in bringing the charges.\n\nThe gun case is US v. Biden, 23-cr-00061, US District Court for the District of Delaware (Wilmington).", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

What to know about Trump-appointed special counsel on Hunter Biden case", "body": "The trial for President Joe Biden's son on felony gun charges began Monday in Delaware, the latest turn in the saga of an investigation by Justice Department special counsel David Weiss\n\nHunter Biden is on trial now for three firearms felonies; two for allegedly lying on a form to purchase a gun in 2018, and one related to his possession of a firearm. In a separate case brought by Weiss in Los Angeles federal court, Biden has also been indicted on nine tax offense charges. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases.\n\nWeiss has been investigating Biden for more than five years - first as the Trump administration-appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware and more recently as a DOJ special counsel. He has been criticized along the way after an earlier plea deal failed and Biden's lawyer argued the charges were politically motivated.\n\nHere is what to know about Weiss and his involvement in the case:\n\nLive updates: Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, faces felony gun charges in Delaware\n\nDavid Weiss was appointed in 2017 under Trump as U.S attorney for the District of Delaware, and the Biden administration asked him to keep the position in 2021 while he continued his Hunter Biden investigation.\n\nIn August 2023, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Weiss to serve as special counsel for investigations and prosecutions in the Hunter Biden probe.\n\n\"Weiss advised me that in his judgment, his investigation has reached a stage at which he should continue his work as a special counsel, and he asked to be so appointed,\" said Garland in an announcement about Weiss's appointment.\n\nThe appointment came after a plea agreement over the gun and tax charges fell apart, and Biden was indicted on the gun charges shortly after.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika rejected a plea agreement last July that aimed to resolve Weiss's investigation.\n\nHunter Biden had agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanors for nonpayment of taxes in 2017 and 2018, and to enter a pretrial program on a gun charge.\n\nBiden potentially could have stayed out of jail under the agreement, which congressional Republicans slammed as a \"sweetheart deal.\" But Noreika questioned prosecutors and defense lawyers about whether the deal would protect Hunter Biden from future charges and the judge refused to \"rubber-stamp\" the agreement.\n\nThe collapse of the plea deal led to Biden's indictment on three felony gun charges in Delaware, and the nine tax charges in California, in a trial set for Sept. 5.\n\nWeiss went on defense after the indictment, telling a House Judiciary Committee in November that politics did not play a role in the investigation and he was the sole decision maker at the Justice Department.\n\nWhile legal experts say the charges against Biden are rarely prosecuted, congressional Republicans said the plea agreement was a \"sweetheart deal.\"\n\nAbbe Lowell, the lawyer representing Hunter Biden, said the charges were politically driven by Trump and deviated from the Justice Department's usual policies.\n\n\"The only substantive and relevant changes since July, when the US Attorney decided against pursuing these exact charges against Mr. Biden, has been various court rulings undermining the constitutionality of the law at issue here and a coordinated, partisan attack on our system of justice by right-wing Republicans,\" Lowell said in a statement.\n\nBut a federal judge dismissed a request to dismiss the gun charges after Lowell argued, among a few things, that the prosecutors are influenced by Republican pressure.\n\nThe gun trial started Monday with jury selection and could last at least two weeks.\n\nContributing: Xerxes

(AP) -- A federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter opened Monday with jury selection, following the collapse of a plea deal that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden was seated in the front row of the courtroom, in a show of support for her son.\n\nIn a statement, the president said that as a dad he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she will ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first to the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court to support him. The president was at their Wilmington home until he left later in the day for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors hope to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nLong reported from Washington.

It will be followed, in September, by a trial on more serious charges of failing to pay taxes from a time when he was using drugs and alcohol heavily and spending lavishly.\n\nFor months, Republicans have claimed, without producing evidence, that Joe Biden somehow profited from his son's overseas business deals -- in hopes of diverting attention from the accusations against former President Donald Trump and initiating a tit-for-tat impeachment.\n\nBut it is the son -- and not the father -- who will stand trial during an election year in which Trump has already been convicted of felonies.\n\nHunter Biden is set to report to the fourth-floor courtroom of Judge Maryellen Noreika in a trial expected to last three to five days.\n\nHere's what else to know:\n\n-- Last September, a federal grand jury charged Biden with three felonies: lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the federal firearms application used to screen applicants and possessing an illegally obtained gun for 11 days, from Oct. 12 to Oct. 23, 2018.\n\n-- If convicted, Biden could face up to 25 years in prison and $750,000 in fines. But nonviolent first-time offenders who have not been accused of using the weapon in another crime rarely get serious prison time for the charges. In fact, legal experts say it is more likely a sentence could include a central element of the original plea deal -- mandatory enrollment in a firearms diversion program intended to reduce incarceration rates for the least serious gun crimes.\n\n-- It is also possible that the parties could reach another plea agreement, much narrower than the first, though Biden's legal team believes prosecutors are determined to bring the case to trial to avoid accusations that they are showing preferential treatment.\n\n-- After intense digging and unfounded accusations, Republicans in Congress have yet to prove that Joe Biden profited from his troubled son's dealings with a Ukrainian energy company. For now, they have abandoned their stated objective of impeaching the president, who they claim, without evidence, is the leader of the \"Biden crime family.\"\n\n-- But the spectacle of Hunter Biden's trial, and its timing, creates significant headaches for Joe Biden's campaign, as it seeks to maximize the effect of Trump's conviction on 34 felony charges of falsifying business records.\n\n-- The trial also promises to be an excruciating personal ordeal for the president. The special counsel overseeing the prosecution, David Weiss, has signaled that he will air some of the Biden family's most embarrassing secrets by calling Hunter Biden's former wife, Kathleen Buhle, who is locked in a long legal battle with him over unpaid alimony, according to prosecutors. A top deputy to Weiss, Leo Wise, has filed court papers indicating that he also plans to call Hallie Biden, the widow of Hunter Biden's brother, Beau. Hallie Biden was dating Hunter Biden when he bought the handgun at issue in the case in 2018.", "source": {"uri": "centredaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Centre Daily Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legal immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_juries_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand juries in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Buhle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kathleen Buhle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_impeachment_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal impeachment in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incarceration in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alimony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alimony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/4s1d7q/picture288962035/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/9f6bdf93-a08e-4bcf-8d6b-2d16114d0078", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-12", "dateEnd": "2018-10-23", "textStart": 1610, "textEnd": 1634}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Jury selection will begin today. The case, historic for being the first time a sitting president's child has faced trial, could have significant implications for President Biden's re-election campaign, CNN, Fox News and NBC News are all reporting.\n\nBiden, 54, is facing three felony charges related to the illegal purchase and possession of a firearm while he was allegedly abusing drugs. The charges stem from an October 2018 incident when Biden purchased a gun and later had it discarded by his girlfriend due to concerns over his mental health. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, though as a first-time offender, he is unlikely to receive the maximum sentence. In fact, it is unlikely he would see any jail time.\n\nThe indictment, brought by special counsel David Weiss, includes two charges for making false statements on federal forms required for the gun purchase and one charge for illegal possession of the firearm. According to the indictment, Biden falsely answered \"No\" to the question about whether he was an unlawful user of, or addicted to, illegal drugs, according to CNN.\n\nThe trial is expected to last one to two weeks. U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika is presiding over the case, which follows a year after a plea deal between Hunter Biden and prosecutors fell apart under her scrutiny.\n\nProsecutors plan to call about a dozen witnesses, including three of Hunter Biden's former romantic partners: his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle, Hallie Biden (the widow of his late brother with whom he had a romantic relationship after his brother passed away) and Lunden Roberts, the mother of one of his children. Their testimonies are expected to focus on Biden's drug use around the time of the gun purchase.\n\nThe trial follows the recent conviction of former President Donald Trump on 34 felony counts related to falsifying business records but was seen as many as a political witch hunt. The \"falsified\" documents were in relation to an alleged payoff prior to the 2016 election to porn star Stormy Daniels, who is enshrined in the Nightmoves Hall of Fame (not making this up), to keep her quiet about a sexual encounter she alleges occurred between her and Trump. Trump denies the encounter ever took place.\n\nA federal appeals court previously denied Hunter Biden's requests to postpone his trial and overturn several motions to dismiss the case, providing many Republicans with the hoped political payback they wish to see inflicted on Biden following Trumps legal woes, all brought about by Democratic prosecutors.\n\nDespite the federal nature of the charges, the White House has stated that President Biden will not pardon his son if convicted. A guilty verdict and time will tell.\n\nThe outcome of this trial could have far-reaching consequences, not only for Hunter Biden but also for the political landscape as the 2024 presidential election approaches. It also remains to be seen if the trial could unwittingly open a door for more examination into the alleged illegal business dealings of the sitting president and his son, accepting money from the Ukraine and China. Congressional investigations have been conducted on those dealings with just enough evidence coming to light to spawn conspiracy theories, but not enough to warrant a full trial on the matter. At least not yet...it took Democrats nearly eight years to find something they could get to stick to Trump in a court of law. The Republicans have a couple more years to go.", "source": {"uri": "thetruthaboutguns.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Truth About Guns"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He joined the publication in 2021 on the crime beat.\n\nHunter Biden's loved ones joined him at the Wilmington, Del., federal courthouse on Monday, June 3, to offer moral support as he goes on trial for three felony firearm charges.\n\nHunter's younger sister, Ashley Biden, arrived first, shortly after 8 a.m. local time. Hunter came minutes later, approaching the building hand in hand with his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden.\n\nDr. Jill Biden, whose 73rd birthday falls on Monday, then arrived with her Secret Service detail, emphasizing the unprecedented nature of a member of the first family answering to criminal charges.\n\nThe first lady raised Hunter as her own after his mother, Neilia Hunter Biden, died in a 1972 car accident. Jill and Joe Biden later had Ashley, who is Hunter's half-sister.\n\nPresident Biden, who spent time with Hunter in Rehoboth Beach over the weekend, was scheduled to depart Wilmington on Monday rather than stay through the first day of trial with other family members.\n\nBut even as he aimed to maintain business as usual, the president shared a rare public statement about his only surviving son as the jury selection process began.\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" President Biden said on Monday morning. \"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean.\"\n\n\"As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength. Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support,\" he continued.\n\nHunter was charged by his father's Department of Justice in September with three felony counts related to illegal firearm possession.\n\nThe first two counts allege that Hunter lied on forms in order to obtain a revolver in 2018, by stating that he wasn't using illegal drugs at the time. A third count alleges that Hunter, who has been open about his addiction issues, possessed the revolver while using a narcotic.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Hunter owned the gun for 11 days before his girlfriend threw it in a dumpster, citing concerns about his mental health.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer.\n\nOnce 12 jurors and four alternates are selected, the trial will move into opening statements. It is expected to last one to two weeks, and if the jury ultimately convicts Hunter, he faces up to 25 years in prison and up to $750,000 in fines.\n\nHunter was separately indicted in California on nine federal tax charges related to alleged tax evasion, which could result in a 17-year prison sentence if he's convicted.

"Historic US election-season trial of Biden's son set to begin", "body": "Hunter Biden, pictured in 2023, wrote in his memoir that he was \"smoking crack every 15 minutes\"\n\nJoe Biden's son Hunter goes on trial Monday on gun charges, the first prosecution in US history for the child of a sitting president -- just as the Democratic leader is seeking to accelerate his campaign for reelection.\n\nThe 54-year-old denies three felony counts stemming from his purchase of a .38-caliber Colt Cobra revolver in 2018 when, by his own admission, he was heavily addicted to drugs.\n\nThe Yale-trained lawyer and lobbyist-turned-artist has been plagued by legal troubles and controversies that have been a drag on his father's campaign, mostly connected to alcoholism and crack cocaine addiction.\n\nIn the latest chapter in his troubled life, Hunter Biden will be tried in the family's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, on two counts of making false statements on paperwork for the gun purchase that he was not using drugs illegally.\n\nHe faces a third charge that he illegally possessed the gun -- which he had for only 11 days in October 2018.\n\nThe prosecution is a public relations test for the Democrats, coming just days after another historic event -- Republican White House nominee Donald Trump becoming the first former US president to be criminally convicted.\n\n- 'Smoking crack' -\n\nBiden campaign aides face the challenge of ensuring that daily responses to journalists' questions about the trial do not force Trump's own legal battles out of the headlines.\n\nIf found guilty, Hunter Biden could in theory face 25 years in prison, though in practice such offenses, if not accompanied by other charges, are seldom punished by jail time.\n\nJurors will hear about the defendant's excessive drug use as prosecutors run through the series of events that led to him buying the firearm in Delaware before it was thrown into a grocery store trash can by his girlfriend.\n\nThe younger Biden, who says he has been sober since 2019, chronicled his longtime struggles with drug addiction in his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things\" -- writing in one eye-watering extract that he was \"smoking crack every 15 minutes.\"\n\nMore from this section Stratford ice cream shop erupts in flames For Eddie: Foster Bike Park hosts BMX Freestyle Season Opener Amityville school board formally eliminate approximately 13 positions\n\nThe book is almost certain to be brought up at trial, with prosecutors expected to lean in on sections in which Biden describes being an addict for four years up to March 2019.\n\nThe defense team has pushed for narrow definitions of the terms \"addict\" and \"user\" and requested instructions requiring an acquittal if the jury determines that the defendant did not consider himself to fit those definitions.\n\n- Rehabilitation -\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" his lawyer Abbe Lowell wrote in court documents.\n\n\"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nThe case comes with Republicans pursuing an impeachment inquiry in Congress into what they claim is a Biden family criminal conspiracy, although they have provided no evidence that the president did anything wrong.\n\nRepublican politicians have accused Hunter Biden of engaging in corrupt business practices in China and Ukraine but he has not been charged with any crimes related to his foreign business dealings.\n\nThe president has repeatedly said he stands by his son and loves him for his attempts to recover from drug addiction, while the White House has not commented on the investigation itself.\n\nProsecutors have said they expect to take three days to present their case, and the entire trial will likely last about two weeks.\n\nHunter Biden faces separate tax evasion charges in his home state of California, in a case set to go to trial later in the year.\n\nstr-ft/cl", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType":

Below is a look at the key moments leading up to the trial, the first for a child of a sitting president.\n\nMay 13, 2014: Burisma Group, a private energy company in Ukraine, said Hunter Biden would be joining its board. Joe Biden is vice president and oversees Ukraine policy for the administration of President Barack Obama. Burisma's founder was the subject of a series of criminal investigations by Ukrainian authorities, which would be closed in 2017 after company and founder made payments to authorities.\n\nMay 30, 2015: Joe Biden's oldest of two sons, Beau Biden, dies of cancer. Hunter Biden would later write in his autobiography, Beautiful Things, it set off his descent into addiction.\n\nOct. 12, 2018: Hunter Biden purchases a Colt Cobra .38 Special revolver and on the federal firearm purchase form, he responded \"no\" to a question if he was an unlawful user of controlled substances or an addict. Later that month his sister-in-law threw it in a public trash bin where it was discovered by a man collecting recyclables and turned over to police.\n\n2019: U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware, David Weiss, begins investigating Hunter Biden for potential tax and other financial crimes, according to media reports. Weiss was appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nApril 2019: Joe Biden announces his bid for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. Hunter Biden's term on the Burisma board expires.\n\nJuly 25, 2019: President Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and pressured him to investigate an allegation that Joe Biden, while in office, muscled the Ukrainian authorities to shut down a probe that could implicate Hunter Biden's work for Burisma. The Bidens denied the allegations. The U.S. House of Representatives would later impeach Trump over the call although the Senate voted against removing Trump from power.\n\nJune 20, 2023: Hunter Biden reaches a deal to plead guilty to two misdemeanor charges of willfully failing to pay income taxes and to enter into an agreement to avert a conviction on gun-related charges. The agreement sparked accusations by Republicans that Hunter Biden was receiving favorable treatment as the president's son.\n\nJuly 26, 2023: U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika said she can't accept a plea deal that Hunter Biden worked out with prosecutors because of concerns it was overly broad and insulated him from other potential business-related charges.\n\nSept. 14, 2023: Hunter Biden is charged in Delaware for gun-related crimes and faces up to 25 years in prison. He denies the accusations and later enters a not guilty plea.\n\nDec. 8, 2023: Hunter Biden is charged with federal tax crimes in Los Angeles and he will later plead not guilty. His lawyer Abbe Lowell accuses Weiss, who led the probe, of political bias.\n\nJune 3, 2024: Jury selection begins in Wilmington, Delaware over the gun-related charges. The trial could last more than two weeks according to the parties.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; Editing by Nick Zieminski)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

He is charged with two counts related to false statements in purchasing the firearm and a third count of illegally obtaining a firearm while addicted to drugs.\n\nBut Hunter Biden's legal team believes it can throw a wrench in Weiss' tidy narrative. At a recent pretrial hearing, an attorney for Biden suggested the firearm form at the heart of the case was \"much more complicated than [the] special counsel indicates it is.\"\n\nJury selection for the trial is set to begin on Monday. And if 12 Delaware residents accept the government's story, the president's only living son could face a prison sentence.\n\nThe task of fighting that outcome falls to Abbe Lowell, a veteran defense attorney who has represented several other high-profile figures, including Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.\n\nHow Lowell plans to fight the charges remains somewhat unclear. He has signaled to U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika that the contours of his case would depend in large part on how prosecutors proceed at trial.\n\nBut in court records and at pretrial hearings, he has offered some tea leaves -- and suggested he will attempt to cast doubt on some of the government's most crucial evidence and witnesses.\n\nLowell has, for example, latched onto revelations in court that two copies exist of the federal gun form at the heart of the case, called an ATF Form 4473. A shop employee created the original document when Hunter Biden purchased the firearm in 2018. It lists Biden's passport as the ID he presented to the shop employee.\n\nYears later, however, a copy was made. The copy included a handwritten note, \"DE Vehicle Registration,\" on a line left blank for \"Supplemental Government Issued Documentation.\" Store employees did so in 2021 to rectify a requirement that gun buyers present a form of ID that includes an address, which passports do not.\n\nLowell contends that gun store employees \"tampered with\" the document, and that it raises questions about \"who wrote what on the form, and when.\"\n\nWeiss' office has said the gun shop employees merely \"annotated\" the document. But they took Lowell's argument seriously enough to re-interview the gun store owner, Ronald Palimere, on May 16.\n\nDuring the interview, according to notes filed on the case docket, Palimere said Hunter Biden's legal tribulations were becoming \"a big scandal and there was intense attention on the incident,\" and that employees at the store \"were all scared to death.\"\n\nPalimere \"felt it was necessary to annotate the Form 4473 because he felt they were going to get in trouble just for going up against Biden,\" according to the notes.\n\nIf jurors are persuaded by Lowell's tack, the argument could undermine the credibility of some key government witnesses -- the people who sold Biden the gun -- and potentially create a reasonable doubt that Hunter Biden was the one who actually checked that box.\n\nAt least two gun store employees, including Palimere, are expected to testify at the trial.\n\nLowell may also advance the argument that Hunter Biden may have been confused by the language on the ATF Form 4473. The box he checked \"no\" asked of the buyer, \"Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to\" various narcotics.\n\n\"The issue here is Mr. Biden's understanding of the question, which asks in the present tense if he 'is' a user or addict,\" Lowell wrote in court papers.\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" he continued. \"Someone like Mr. Biden, who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nFinally, Lowell has raised \"an issue of chain of custody\" with a leather pouch that allegedly held the revolver Hunter Biden purchased. In court documents filed earlier this year, prosecutors said this pouch had cocaine residue on it.\n\nAfter purchasing the firearm in 2018, Hunter Biden possessed it for less than two weeks before his then-romantic partner, Hallie Biden - who is also the widow of his brother, Beau - discovered the weapon and the pouch, discarded them in a dumpster.\n\nThe gun was soon recovered by the authorities, but the pouch was not tested for drug residue until five years later, in 2023. Lowell said at the pretrial hearing that he wants to question witnesses about what happened to the pouch during those five years when it was in police custody to see if it was \"tampered with.\"\n\nOne of the witnesses Lowell plans to call for the defense is a chemical residue expert.\n\nProsecutors hope these arguments fall flat, and that jurors rely on the voluminous evidence they plan to present to find Hunter Biden guilty of committing the three felony charges he faces.\n\nProsecutors seem poised to use Hunter Biden's own words against him -- excerpts from his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" and text messages he exchanged around the time of the gun purchase -- to demonstrate that he was in fact a drug user when he filled out the ATF Form 4473 and procured the weapon.\n\nIn one text message prosecutors included in court filings, Hunter Biden wrote two days after allegedly purchasing the gun: \"I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney,\" referring to an intersection in Wilmington.\n\nWeiss' office also plans to show jurors the original ATF Form 4473, in which Biden represented that \"he was not an unlawful user of, or addicted to, any stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance\" -- despite allegedly knowing it not to be true.\n\nProsecutors indicated that they plan to call as many as 12 witnesses, including Hallie Biden and Hunter Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle.\n\nLowell has not yet decided whether Hunter Biden will testify in his own defense.\n\nThe trial begins on Monday and is expected to last two to three weeks. If he's found guilty, Biden could face a prison sentence of up to 25 years, though legal experts suggest that, as a first-time and nonviolent offender, he would not likely serve time.\n\nWeiss' office also charged Hunter Biden in December with nine felony and misdemeanor charges stemming from his failure to pay $1.4 million in taxes for three years during a time when he was in the throes of addiction. The back taxes and penalties were eventually paid in full by a third party, identified by ABC News as Hunter Biden's attorney and confidant, Kevin Morris. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nThe trial in that case was scheduled to begin on June 20 in California, but Lowell successfully petitioned the judge to postpone it until Sept. 5 -- raising the likelihood that a jury could be deliberating whether to convict the president's son on several felony counts in the waning weeks of the 2024 election.", "source": {"uri":

Below is a look at the key moments leading up to the trial, the first for a child of a sitting president.\n\nMay 13, 2014: Burisma Group, a private energy company in Ukraine, said Hunter Biden would be joining its board. Joe Biden is vice president and oversees Ukraine policy for the administration of President Barack Obama. Burisma's founder was the subject of a series of criminal investigations by Ukrainian authorities, which would be closed in 2017 after company and founder made payments to authorities.\n\nMay 30, 2015: Joe Biden's oldest of two sons, Beau Biden, dies of cancer. Hunter Biden would later write in his autobiography, Beautiful Things, it set off his descent into addiction.\n\nOct. 12, 2018: Hunter Biden purchases a Colt Cobra .38 Special revolver and on the federal firearm purchase form, he responded \"no\" to a question if he was an unlawful user of controlled substances or an addict. Later that month his sister-in-law threw it in a public trash bin where it was discovered by a man collecting recyclables and turned over to police.\n\n2019: U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware, David Weiss, begins investigating Hunter Biden for potential tax and other financial crimes, according to media reports. Weiss was appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nApril 2019: Joe Biden announces his bid for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. Hunter Biden's term on the Burisma board expires.\n\nJuly 25, 2019: President Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and pressured him to investigate an allegation that Joe Biden, while in office, muscled the Ukrainian authorities to shut down a probe that could implicate Hunter Biden's work for Burisma. The Bidens denied the allegations. The U.S. House of Representatives would later impeach Trump over the call although the Senate voted against removing Trump from power.\n\nJune 20, 2023: Hunter Biden reaches a deal to plead guilty to two misdemeanor charges of willfully failing to pay income taxes and to enter into an agreement to avert a conviction on gun-related charges. The agreement sparked accusations by Republicans that Hunter Biden was receiving favorable treatment as the president's son.\n\nJuly 26, 2023: U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika said she can't accept a plea deal that Hunter Biden worked out with prosecutors because of concerns it was overly broad and insulated him from other potential business-related charges.\n\nSept. 14, 2023: Hunter Biden is charged in Delaware for gun-related crimes and faces up to 25 years in prison. He denies the accusations and later enters a not guilty plea.\n\nDec. 8, 2023: Hunter Biden is charged with federal tax crimes in Los Angeles and he will later plead not guilty. His lawyer Abbe Lowell accuses Weiss, who led the probe, of political bias.\n\nJune 3, 2024: Jury selection begins in Wilmington, Delaware over the gun-related charges. The trial could last more than two weeks according to the parties.

Delaware", "body": "Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted of the federal charges in Delaware\n\nWith the strike of a judge's gavel in Delaware, Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden, will become the first child of a sitting president to be a criminal defendant.\n\nProsecutors allege that the younger Biden, 54, lied about his drug use on application forms when he purchased a handgun in 2018.\n\nHe faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted of the three federal counts, in a case that will get underway on Monday with jury selection.\n\nMr Biden has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nThe trial - which comes as his father campaigns for re-election - is likely to see prosecutors delve into graphic details of Mr Biden's crack cocaine addiction, potentially providing fodder for the president's political foes.\n\nMr Biden is facing three federal charges in the case: two counts of making false statements and one count of illegal gun possession.\n\nThe charges all relate to his purchase of a revolver at a Delaware gun store in October 2018, which he kept for about 11 days.\n\nBy Mr Biden's own admission, he was deep in the throes of a \"full-blown addiction\" to crack cocaine at the time.\n\nThe two false statement charges stem from allegations that he lied about his drug use on a federally mandated form when he purchased the weapon.\n\nSpecifically, prosecutors allege that he falsely claimed that he was \"not an unlawful user of and addicted to any stimulant narcotic drug\" when he purchased a Colt Cobra Special revolver.\n\nThe third count is related to his possession of a firearm while alleged to have been a drug user.\n\nThe gun was discarded and discovered at a grocery store in Greenville, Delaware, prompting an investigation that ultimately led investigators back to the forms.\n\nWhat evidence is there in the case?\n\nTo convict Mr Biden, prosecutors will have to convince jurors that he knowingly made false statements on the form in a bid to deceive the store that sold him the pistol.\n\nAdditionally, they will have to prove that Mr Biden was a drug user or addicted to drugs, and took possession of the gun despite knowing as much.\n\nUS District Judge Maryellen Noreika has already ruled that defence lawyers cannot argue that the prosecution can only get a guilty verdict by proving Mr Biden was using drugs on the day he bought the weapon.\n\nInstead, in a pre-trial hearing, the judge agreed with prosecutors' argument that they need only prove that \"unlawful use (had) occurred recently enough to indicate that the individual (was) actively engaged in such conduct\".\n\nIn court filings made ahead of the trial's start, prosecutors suggested that they would rely, in part, on deeply personal text messages and other communications made while Mr Biden was in the throes of addiction.\n\nIn one such text message cited in court documents, Mr Biden refers to himself as a \"liar and a thief and a blame and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know\".\n\nThe prosecution is also expected to rely on the testimonies of witnesses including ex-wife Kathleen Buhle and Mr Biden's ex-partner Hallie Biden - who is also the widow of Mr Biden's brother Beau.\n\nProsecutors will also be able to point to Mr Biden's own 2021 memoir, in which he detailed his experiences as a drug user who was \"up twenty-four hours a day, smoking every 15 minutes, seven days a week\".\n\n\"All my energy revolved around smoking drugs and making arrangements to buy drugs - feeding the beast,\" he wrote in the book.\n\nWhile Mr Biden has himself been quiet about the trial, legal documents filed by his lawyers suggest that they will focus on how much Mr Biden was aware of his addiction at the end of the purchase, and on the quality of the evidence itself.\n\nHis primary attorney, Abbe Lowell, has sought permission from the court to call upon an expert witness who can testify about an addict's understanding of their substance abuse issues.\n\n\"Someone, like Mr, Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict,\" Mr Lowell wrote.\n\nInfamous laptop could feature\n\nAmong the most prominent pieces of evidence at the trial is likely to be the information on Mr Biden's infamous laptop, which has been the focus of intense media speculation and focus from conservative news outlets.\n\nThe laptop has also been at the centre of unproven theories linking Mr Biden and his father to corruption, which they both deny.\n\nMr Biden's own lawyers have argued that the computer was tampered with before it fell into the hands of investigators.\n\nThe special counsel appointed to oversee the probes into Hunter Biden, David Weiss, has said that the tampering argument is a \"conspiracy theory\" with \"no supporting evidence.\"\n\nIn a May filing, prosecutors wrote that the laptop contained \"significant evidence\" of Mr Biden's guilt.\n\nCould he go to prison if convicted?\n\nThe two false statement charges each carry a maximum sentence of up to 10 years, while the third count is punishable by up to five years - meaning that Mr Biden could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted.\n\nActual sentences for federal crimes, however, are typically less than the maximum penalties specified by law.\n\nIf Mr Biden is convicted, the judge in the case will ultimately determine the sentence after considering sentencing guidelines and a variety of other legal factors.\n\nHunter Biden's other charges\n\nIn addition to the gun charges in Delaware, Mr Biden is facing separate federal charges in California over allegations that he evaded a tax assessment, failed to properly file and pay taxes and filed a fraudulent tax return.\n\nSeveral months after the spectacular collapse of a plea deal that would address both sets of charges last year, Mr Biden also pleaded not guilty to the tax charges.", "source": {"uri": "the-star.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Weiss outlined the trove of evidence -- physical and digital -- that prosecutors will present at trial and what witnesses are lined up to testify against the First Son.\n\nThe excerpts include Hunter Biden's own admissions of \"hardcore\" drug use that he published and widely distributed. He self-identified as a crack addict, \"someone who's up twenty-four hours a day, smoking every fifteen minutes, seven days a week.\"\n\n\"I was a crack addict and that was that. F**k it,\" Hunter Biden wrote when describing a call with a drug connection.\n\nOn Pages 219 and 220, Hunter Biden admitted that he was actively addicted to crack cocaine between 2015 and 2019.\n\n\"By the time my plane touched down in Los Angeles in March 2019, I had no plan beyond the moment-to-moment demands of the crack pipe,\" Hunter Biden wrote, adding that \"nearly four years of active addiction [...] preceded this trip to California,\" which included a half-dozen rehab attempts repeatedly ending in failure. Everything that followed his arrival in L.A. was \"a genuine, dictionary-definition blur of complete and utter debauchery,\" he typed. \"I was doing nothing but drinking and drugging.\"\n\nIn Chapter Nine, titled \"California Odyssey,\" Hunter Biden described doing drugs the day he first landed at LAX in the spring of 2018, swiftly tearing through the streets of L.A. He called this ability to easily \"find crack anytime, anywhere\" his \"superpower.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of this summer-long California bender, with the aid of his uncle, Hunter Biden checked into \"The View,\" a luxury rehab center in Brentwood, to detox. Via search warrant, the prosecution obtained a \"DTX/Stabilization\" form -- dated mid-August 2018 -- and invoices documenting his six-day stay. However, he relapsed roughly two weeks later, which he went on to admit.\n\nIn \"Chapter Ten: Lost Highway,\" Hunter Biden said he couldn't \"stay sober\" and never ended up \"getting clean\" through therapy.\n\nThat fall, Hunter Biden went eastbound, ultimately landing in Delaware. Regarding his return, he wrote: \"[A]fter my most recent relapse in California, [I had] the hope of getting clean through a new therapy and reconciling with Hallie. Neither happened.\"\n\nThen, Hunter Biden spent a short stint at a therapist-run wellness center in Newburyport, Massachusetts.\n\nHowever, he headed back toward Biden's home state of Delaware not long afterward to continue to smoke crack, spending several weeks living in \"a series of low-budget, low-expectations motels\" up and down Interstate 95, between New Haven and Bridgeport, exchanging \"L.A.'s $400-a-night bungalows and their endless parade of blingy degenerates for the underbelly of Connecticut's $59-a-night motels room and the dealers, hookers, and hard-core addicts -- like me -- who favored them.\"\n\n\"I hardly went anywhere now, except to buy. It was me and a crack pipe in a Super 8, not knowing which the f**k way was up,\" Hunter Biden wrote. \"All my energy revolved around smoking drugs and making arrangements to buy drugs -- feeding the beast.\"\n\nThe prosecution has also filed a motion to admit soundbites from Hunter Biden's audiobook, in which he narrated his memoir.\n\nExhibit 2 is a log of Hunter Biden's messages detailing his crack-chasing chronicles.\n\nProsecutors say the underlying material is voluminous. In total, there are 18,130 pages of data summarized in the chart.\n\nThe messages, which an FBI forensics specialist extracted from Hunter Biden's infamous \"laptop from hell,\" delve into some of his sordid escapades in the days following the handgun's purchase when it was still in his possession prior to its dumping.\n\nOn the night of October 13, 2018, Hunter Biden texted that he was on Maryland Avenue lurking behind the stadium of the Wilmington Blue Rocks, a Minor League Baseball team, waiting for a drug dealer named \"Mookie.\" The next day, Hunter Biden messaged that he was \"sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney,\" an intersection in downtown Wilmington.\n\n\"What's the worst place for me to be trying to stay clean? Delaware,\" Hunter Biden texted on November 21, 2018.\n\nThe prosecution also pulled videos and photographs of Hunter Biden smoking crack that were backed up to his Apple iCloud account, uploaded to his laptop, or sent over text. Among the incriminating files, Hunter Biden took a picture of himself with a crack pipe in his hand, and he snapped a full-naked mirror selfie with a bong in the background. (Thankfully, they're censored.)\n\nOne of the screenshots looks like it's from the viral video of Hunter Biden weighing crack with a gram scale and debating the amount without the plastic baggie. A glimpse of his cigarette-stuffed face is briefly visible at the beginning of the 18-second clip.\n\nPresently, the prosecution opted not to include relevant texts with \"certain family members\" in the chatlogs, but the prosecutors indicated they'll do so if the defense advances the argument that Hunter Biden did not know he was in such a \"prohibited status.\"\n\nA trio of Hunter Biden's exes will be called on to testify against him.\n\nAlthough they're not named explicitly, based on the identifying information that the prosecution provided, \"Witness 1,\" \"Witness 2,\" and \"Witness 3\" are presumably Hunter Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle; his baby mama, Lunden Roberts, with whom he fathered five-year-old Navy Joan Roberts; and the widow of Hunter Biden's brother, Hallie Biden, with whom he had an affair.\n\nRoberts successfully sued Hunter Biden, who had denied paternity, for being a deadbeat dad, forcing him to pay child support. Navy, the seventh grandchild of President Biden, has been repeatedly snubbed by both Hunter Biden and the entire Biden family.\n\nRoberts will testify that she observed Hunter Biden \"using crack cocaine frequently -- every 20 minutes except when he slept.\"\n\nHallie Biden had discarded the gun, tossing it into the trash can outside of the local Janssen Market. Authorities eventually recovered the revolver from the Wilmington grocery's dumpster after a man who was collecting recyclables made the discovery.\n\nUpon realizing Hallie Biden had confiscated the firearm, which was concealed in his car, on October 23, 2018, Hunter Biden messaged: \"Did you take that from me [redacted]? Are you insane. Tell me now. This is no game...\" After talking to police, an irate Hunter Biden texted: \"The f**king FBI [redacted]. It's hard to believe anyone is that stupid // so what's my fault here Hallie that you speak of. Owning a gun that's in a locked car hidden on another property? You say I invade your privacy. What more can I do than come back to you to try again. And you do this???? Who in their right mind would trust you would help me get sober?\"\n\nOver the course of the couple's fling, when Hunter Biden stayed at her home in the fall of 2018, Hallie Biden told prosecutions that she and her children searched his bags, backpacks, and car, discovering drugs in his possession on multiple occasions.\n\nDays before Hallie Biden's anticipated testimony, President Biden reportedly visited his daughter-in-law near the ninth anniversary of Beau Biden's death, and Hunter Biden was recently photographed aboard Air Force One ahead of trial.\n\nBuhle, who was previously married to Hunter Biden and divorced him in April 2017, said she'd routinely check his vehicle out of concern that their children could be in a car containing drugs. While searching, Buhle said she occasionally found drugs or drug-related paraphernalia inside, which was corroborated by a March 9, 2018, text exchange with Hunter Biden, per prosecutors.\n\n\"I also found a few crack pipes. I took them out because our daughter was driving the car,\" Buhle allegedly told him.\n\nThe prosecution also intends to call on U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) supervisory special agent Joshua Romig, who will decode \"coded\" terminology and \"drug language\" Hunter Biden used over text, such as \"baby powder,\" \"Party Favor,\" \"10grams,\" \"I need more chore boy,\" \"one full,\" \"fentan,\" and \"a ball.\" Dr. Jason Brewer, a chemist, will also serve as an expert witness testifying that traces of cocaine appeared on a brown leather pouch that was discovered next to the discarded handgun.\n\nAn employee with the StarQuest Shooters and Survival Supply, where the sale transpired, will testify that on October 12, 2018, Hunter Biden entered the gun shop, surveyed its inventory, and purchased the $749.95 Colt Cobra, an HKS Speedloader, and 25 rounds of Hornady \"American Gunner\" ammunition for the revolver. According to a copy of the completed background check, Hunter Biden answered \"No\" to the question of whether he was an unlawful user of or addicted to depressants, stimulants, narcotics, or any other controlled substances (\"Question 11.e\"). He, then, certified that his answers were true and correct, affirming he understood that making a false written statement on the paperwork was a crime punishable under federal law.\n\nDespite his memoir being replete with confessions, Hunter Biden's counsel is primarily relying on this line of defense: he didn't understand what the terms \"unlawful user\" and \"addict\" meant at the time he filled out the firearms form, signed, and dated it.\n\n\"[T]he issue here is Mr. Biden's understanding of the question [...] The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him. Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict,\" the defense disputed the trial brief.\n\nSo, it all comes down to whether he \"knowingly\" lied, the defense insists -- still disputing what definitions jurors will work with.\n\nIn a court filing Wednesday, the defense submitted arguments asking for additional revisions to the jury instructions, asserting that Hunter Biden's understanding of the wording determines whether he \"knowingly\" believed he was either one: \"A person acts 'knowingly' if that person acts voluntarily and intentionally and not because of mistake or accident or other innocent reason.\"\n\n\"Words sometimes are understood to have different meanings to different people...\" Hunter Biden's lawyers wrote, raising a \"good faith\" defense that he acted honestly, even if he was mistaken or misunderstood the question. \"It does not matter whether you or Congress or anyone else would define the defendant as an 'addict' or 'user of controlled substances,' if Mr. Biden did not understand that he was an 'addict' or 'user' [...] he did not knowingly break the law then either and he must be found not guilty.\"\n\nThe defense has a handful of witnesses: Dr. Joshua Lee, a clinician-researcher focused on addiction pharmacotherapies in \"criminal justice populations,\" who will opine on Hunter Biden's \"state of denial\" about his addiction; Dr. Michael Coyer, a toxicology expert, who will likely dispute Brewer's forensic findings relating to the identification of cocaine found on Hunter Biden's brown-colored pouch; and Dr. Khody Detwiler, who will analyze Hunter Biden's handwriting on the ATF Form 4473.\n\nDr. Elie Aoun may step in for Lee \"in light of a new scheduling conflict\" with the latter to talk about how addicts view themselves.\n\nThe prosecution rejected the defense's witnesses testifying on Hunter Biden's behalf, saying he should speak for himself: \"If the defendant wants the jury to know what he thought about his own addiction or drug use, he has to take the stand and testify or introduce other admissible evidence that reflects his state of mind at the time. He cannot hire an expert to do it for him.\"\n\nAs for the prosecution's trial exhibits, the defense had unsuccessfully sought to outright bar Hunter Biden's laptop from being entered into evidence, claiming that it had been hacked by bad-faith actors beforehand and seeded with false information.\n\n\"The defendant's laptop is real [...] and it contains significant evidence of the defendant's guilt,\" Weiss wrote in response to the opposition filing, citing sources that corroborate the laptop's legitimacy and saying questioning its authenticity is conspiratorial.\n\nThe defense argued that \"the data had been altered and compromised before investigators obtained the electronic material.\"\n\nHunter Biden had dropped off his MacBook Pro at a Delaware computer repair place -- The Mac Shop owned by John Paul Mac Isaac -- in April 2019 and never reclaimed it. Later that year, Mac Isaac handed the hard drive over to the FBI in December 2019.\n\n\"What are the messages the defendant is claiming were somehow retroactively planted into his non-functional laptop, and what is the evidence of that? There is none. He has not shown any of the actual evidence in this case is unreliable or inauthentic...\" Weiss rebutted. \"Instead, the defendant's theory about the laptop is a conspiracy theory with no supporting evidence.\"\n\nHunter Biden's defense counsel also repeated the Russian disinformation claim that a Russian businessman had alleged that his devices were compromised by FSB assets (Russia's Federal Security Service) during a trip he took to Kazakhstan in 2014.\n\nWeiss, a Trump-nominated prosecutor retained by the Biden administration, asked the judge presiding over the proceedings to prohibit Hunter Biden from suggesting that the electronic evidence is fabricated or fake. U.S. District Court Judge Maryellen Noreika, a Trump appointee, ordered at the May 24 pre-trial conference that jurors can be shown the laptop as proof of Hunter Biden's drug use, but the defense may challenge each piece of evidence extracted from the device on an item-by-item basis.\n\nNoreika sometimes sided with the defense. The prosecution is partly prohibited from bringing up Hunter Biden's \"extravagant lifestyle\" at trial, such as his spending spree on high-end escort services, but discussing his splurging on drugs is permissible.\n\n\"Any reference to this issue [...] would be prejudicial beyond any probative value and pose a danger of [...] misleading the jury,\" argued Hunter Biden's high-profile lawyer, Abbe Lowell, who represented Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) in his corruption case.\n\nThe prosecution also cannot reference Hunter Biden's child-support proceedings in Arkansas, discuss his discharge from the U.S. Navy Reserve after failing a cocaine test in 2014, or talk about his separate California tax evasion case in front of the jury.\n\nLast week, Noreika swatted down Hunter Biden's eleventh-hour bid, one of many, to stop the gun case from heading to trial, calling it \"frivolous\" and finding \"no reason to believe\" that the attempt would be \"any more meritorious than his prior efforts.\"\n\nHunter Biden's motion to enjoin the special counsel's investigation and prosecution of him \"from now into the future\" claimed that the use of congressional appropriations to fund Weiss was unconstitutional because the prosecutor is not \"independent counsel.\"\n\n\"Somewhat incongruously, [Biden] has asserted in this case both that he is being selectively prosecuted by a Special Counsel 'making prosecutorial decisions for political reasons,' and that the Special Counsel making those decisions is not actually independent from the Attorney General appointed by his father or the Executive Branch headed by his father,\" Noreika ruled.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mia_cathell@townhall.com", "name": "Mia Cathell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_false_statements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Making false statements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crack cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Revolver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Controlled substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_C._Weiss", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David C.

Under the American laws, drug addicts cannot buy and possess guns.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter faces imprisonment of up to 25 years and a fine of $750,000, according to The New York Times.\n\nIn addition to this case, Hunter also faces a case of tax fraud. The trial in that case is expected to start in September. Moreover, Hunter has also faced accusation over the years of misusing his father's name for personal benefits. The Republicans and critics of his father have often taken up the accusations against Hunter to put his father in the dock.\n\nWhat's the gun case against Hunter Biden?\n\nHunter is accused of three charges in the gun-possession case: lying to a licensed gun dealer, lying on federal gun application form for applicants' screening, and illegally possessing a gun.\n\nLast year, Hunter was indicted on these three counts. He is the first child of an American president to face criminal indictment.\n\nWhile Hunter could receive as many as 25 years in jail if he is convicted, The Times noted that first-time offenders in such cases who have not used guns in violent crimes rarely get serious prison time.\n\nThe long line of Hunter Biden's troubles\n\nThe gun-possession case is not the only one that troubles Hunter. In September, another trial for tax fraud will start.\n\nIn the tax case, a federal grand jury charged Hunter in December 2023 with tax evasion, failure to file and pay tax, and filing a false or fraudulent tax return, according to The Times.\n\nIt was the second indictment of Hunter after the gun possession case. He pleaded not-guilty to the case.\n\nBesides the legal troubles, Hunter has long made negative headlines for his alcoholism, drug abuse, and personal life involving an affair with his sister-in-law and a child with a woman he met at a strip club.\n\nHunter has also been accused of using his father's name for business benefits. He has also been thrown under the scanner over his association with companies accused of corruption and having shady business dealings.\n\nHunter is accused of charging or at least seeking money to lobby on behalf of China- and Libya-related affairs when his father was the Vice President in Barak Obama's administration.

(AP) -- President Joe Biden's son Hunter arrived at court Monday for jury selection in a federal gun case against after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election.\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his father has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nPeople are also reading...

A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of Hunter Biden at https://apnews.com/hub/hunter-biden.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Those back taxes have since been paid, and he pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nHunter Biden was set to take a plea deal that would have given him probation after pleading guilty to the tax charges and would have avoided prosecution in the firearms charge if he stayed out of trouble, but the agreement fell apart after it faced scrutiny from U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, an appointee of his father's predecessor, Donald Trump.\n\nPotential jurors will likely be asked whether they believe the law should apply equally to all, including the son of the president\n\n\"It's not an insignificant charge,\" Victoria Nourse, professor of law at Georgetown Law, told Spectrum News of the gun charge. \"The question is whether this case would ever have been brought if it were not the president's son.\"\n\nNourse says it might be difficult to find an impartial jury.\n\n\"The interesting thing about Delaware is, I believe, that the president has probably shaken the hands of almost everyone in Delaware,\" she said, adding: \"It might be harder than normal to get a jury.\"\n\nHunter Biden has acknowleged a past addiction to cocaine, but his lawyers say he didn't break the law because when he purchased the gun he had recently been to rehab, and may have believed he was sober.\n\n\"I've made mistakes in my life, and wasted opportunities and privileges I was afforded,\" he said at a congressional hearing last year. \"For that, I'm responsible, for that I'm accountable, and for that, I'm making amends.\"\n\nProsecutors will attempt to show that Hunter Biden was generally using drugs at the time he purchased the gun. A judge has already ruled that they do not need to prove that he specifically used drugs on the day he bought the gun.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have filed several unsuccessful motions to dismiss the case, arguing the charges are politically motivated.\n\n\"His lawyers have argued that this is selective prosecution in the sense that generally ... this would be an additional charge for someone who had been convicted of or alleged to have used the gun in a crime, for example, but this is about lying on the form,\" Nourse said.\n\nIt's not clear whether Hunter biden will take the stand. The trial is expected to last at least two weeks. If convicted, he faces up to 25 years in prison.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crack cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryellen_Noreika", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maryellen Noreika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_Law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgetown Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spectrum News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Regulatory_and_Legal", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Regulatory and Legal", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/AP_Hunter_Biden_022824", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-", "textStart": 280, "textEnd": 292}], "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have addiction and know what we mean.

Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\"\n\nBiden's statement was posted on X by Katie Phang, the host of MSNBC's Katie Phang Show.\n\nOne commenter responded: \"Katie, this is trial interference.

He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nThe Hunter Biden trial comes just days after former President Donald Trump, the Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City, the AP noted.\n\n\"A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to an adult film actress to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign,\" the AP wrote. \"The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\"\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.\n\nPeter Malbin \u2709\n\nPeter Malbin, a Newsmax writer, covers news and politics.

Will they pull away from Trump as he awaits sentencing, or rally behind him in the belief he was unfairly prosecuted?\n\nIn Hunter Biden's trial, the electorate isn't so much the issue. Voters aren't likely to blame Biden even if his son is convicted, polling shows. More than half credited Biden with being a good father by supporting his son through myriad legal difficulties, a Reuters-Ipsos survey in January showed.\n\nA bigger question is whether Hunter Biden's fate will distract or distress a sitting president in the throes of a tough re-election bid. The son's trial is the father's as well, in that sense, testing Joe Biden's focus and mental discipline during a pivotal stretch of his presidency.\n\nSoon after the trial gets underway, Biden will leave for his first overseas trip of the year. He'll give a speech in France on Thursday marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings that led to the allied victory in World War II.\n\nLater in the week, he'll meet privately with French President Emmanuel Macron, where they are expected to discuss a grinding war between Russia and Ukraine that has cost U.S. taxpayers $175 billion.\n\nBiden will return to Europe midmonth for a summit meeting in Italy with America's closest democratic allies, and at the end of June he'll take part in his first debate with Trump.\n\n\"He has always put his family at the center of his life,\" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a friend of the president's, said in an interview. \"He will be able to do both. He has shown for decades an ability to both tend to difficult and pressing family needs and carry out his office.\"\n\nThe Bidens are a family drawn close by tragedy. Hunter Biden and his brother Beau were both seriously injured in a car crash in 1972 that killed their mother and baby sister, just weeks after Joe Biden won his first Senate bid.\n\nBeau Biden died of brain cancer at age 46 in 2015, leaving what Hunter Biden described in his 2021 memoir as a \"hole that was hard to fill.\" He used the book to describe a crack cocaine addiction that could have killed him.\n\n\"It will likely be very personal and very painful,\" an adviser to the president said of of Hunter Biden's trial.\n\nIn the run-up to the trial, the two have been virtually inseparable. Privately, some Biden allies have questioned whether it's smart for Biden to give his son a public platform that makes the entire family a target for GOP attacks. Yet if anything, Biden wrapped himself around Hunter more tightly ahead of the trial.\n\nThe younger Biden was a guest at a state dinner at the White House on May 23 for the visiting president of Kenya.\n\nHe joined his father and other family members on Thursday as they visited Beau's gravesite in Wilmington on the ninth anniversary of his death. The next day, Hunter Biden joined his father on Air Force One as they flew to Washington.\n\nOn Saturday, as the president bicycled during his stay at his Rehoboth Beach home in Delaware, his son cycled behind him, according to a White House press pool report.\n\nMichael LaRosa, a former spokesman for first lady Jill Biden, said that \"the Bidens are remarkably normal parents and when their kids are hurting, they're hurting, too.\"\n\n\"Biden communicates daily and directly with his children and I would not expect that to change during the trial,\" LaRosa added. \"This is a father and son who have had an especially close relationship their entire lives, and based on how often they talk to and rely on each other, I expect the president will always be in the loop on the developments, no matter where he physically is in the world.\"\n\nThe Biden and Trump campaigns are taking vastly different approaches to the trial. Trump's team is drawing an equivalence between the ex-president's predicament and that of Hunter Biden. In a Fox News appearance on Thursday after the verdict, Trump spokesman Jason Miller was asked what Trump would say if Biden were to start calling his rival a \"convicted felon.\"\n\n\"Where's Hunter?\" Miller replied.\n\nBiden allies say they aren't worried about that line of attack. \"Where's Hunter?\" was a Trump mantra during the 2020 campaign. Yet Trump lost.\n\n\"It hasn't stuck. So, it doesn't strike me as likely that a trial of Hunter Biden in a crowded media environment will break through,\" said Dmitri Mehlhorn, a Democratic strategist and fundraiser.\n\nAs the trial unfolds, the Biden campaign plans to keep quiet. There won't be any rapid-response statements coming from the Wilmington headquarters about developments inside the federal courthouse, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nOne of Biden's aims is to show that he's not abusing presidential powers by meddling in independent law enforcement investigations. He said little about Trump's case until the verdict was rendered. Though he told MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle last year that his son had \"done nothing wrong,\" he wants to avoid any impression that he's trying to influence the outcome one way or another, Biden advisers said.\n\nA hands-off approach could also help undercut Trump's claim that Biden has weaponized the justice system to sway the election.\n\n\"Maybe this [Hunter Biden's trial] addresses all those Trump disciples who believe that the federal government is out to get Donald Trump,\" said Alan Kessler, a Philadelphia-based attorney and longtime Democratic fundraiser. \"If anything, it levels the playing field and shows there is not some great conspiracy by the government to just go after Donald Trump.\"\n\nHunter Biden was indicted in September on three counts involving possession of a gun while using narcotics. He has pleaded not guilty. The trial may feature moments of personal drama and anguish. Prosecutors have been permitted to delve into Hunter Biden's past drug use. They are expected to call as witnesses his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle, as well as Beau Biden's widow, Hallie Olivere Biden.\n\nA hope among Biden advisers is that voters prove sympathetic to Hunter Biden's struggle with addiction, a nationwide scourge. In 2022, the most recent year in which data was available, nearly 49 million people in the U.S. over the age of 12 had a \"substance use disorder\" involving alcohol or drugs, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nMany voters have struggled with drug or alcohol dependence and should be able to empathize with what the Bidens have endured, said a Democratic fundraiser who is close to the Biden campaign.\n\n\"Twenty-five years ago, this might have been scandalous. But things have changed,\" this person said, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely. Voters are more accepting of \"imperfect families\" and don't tend \"to look down on them and think he [Joe Biden] must be a bad dad.\"\n\nA verdict in the case doesn't end the Hunter Biden saga. In September, he is scheduled to go on trial in California in a separate case involving tax charges. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nBiden aides are anxious about the timing of the tax trial. It will happen just two months before the election and may spill into the early-voting period in some states.\n\nThough Trump was indicted in three other cases, he isn't expected to face any more trials before the election. That could set up an unhelpful split screen, as Biden's advisers see it: Trump will be out campaigning, while the president's son will be sitting in a courtroom defending himself against charges that he failed to pay taxes.\n\nBut a focus group conducted in December with swing voters in North Carolina suggests that people may be forgiving. When the moderator asked one woman whether she was troubled by Hunter's indictment on tax charges, she replied: \"No.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" the moderator asked in the focus group conducted by Engagious/Sago as part of its Swing Voter Project.\n\n\"He's not the president,\" she said. \"I'm not voting for him.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"},

(AP) -- President Joe Biden's son Hunter arrived at court on Monday for jury selection in a federal gun case against him after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden arrived shortly after, entering the courthouse in support of her son.\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nPeople are also reading...

A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHunter Biden arrived first at the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nLong reported from Washington.

Biden's son Hunter goes on trial Monday on gun charges, the first prosecution in US history for the child of a sitting president -- just as the Democratic leader is seeking to accelerate his campaign for reelection.\n\nThe 54-year-old denies three felony counts stemming from his purchase of a .38-caliber Colt Cobra revolver in 2018 when, by his own admission, he was heavily addicted to drugs.\n\nThe Yale-trained lawyer and lobbyist-turned-artist has been plagued by legal troubles and controversies that have been a drag on his father's campaign, mostly connected to alcoholism and crack cocaine addiction.\n\nIn the latest chapter in his troubled life, Hunter Biden will be tried in the family's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, on two counts of making false statements on paperwork for the gun purchase that he was not using drugs illegally.\n\nHe faces a third charge that he illegally possessed the gun -- which he had for only 11 days in October 2018.\n\nThe prosecution is a public relations test for the Democrats, coming just days after another historic event -- Republican White House nominee Donald Trump becoming the first former US president to be criminally convicted.\n\n- 'Smoking crack' -\n\nBiden campaign aides face the challenge of ensuring that daily responses to journalists' questions about the trial do not force Trump's own legal battles out of the headlines.\n\nIf found guilty, Hunter Biden could in theory face 25 years in prison, though in practice such offenses, if not accompanied by other charges, are seldom punished by jail time.\n\nJurors will hear about the defendant's excessive drug use as prosecutors run through the series of events that led to him buying the firearm in Delaware before it was thrown into a grocery store trash can by his girlfriend.\n\nThe younger Biden, who says he has been sober since 2019, chronicled his longtime struggles with drug addiction in his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things\" -- writing in one eye-watering extract that he was \"smoking crack every 15 minutes.\"\n\nThe book is almost certain to be brought up at trial, with prosecutors expected to lean in on sections in which Biden describes being an addict for four years up to March 2019.\n\nThe defense team has pushed for narrow definitions of the terms \"addict\" and \"user\" and requested instructions requiring an acquittal if the jury determines that the defendant did not consider himself to fit those definitions.\n\n- Rehabilitation -\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" his lawyer Abbe Lowell wrote in court documents.\n\n\"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nThe case comes with Republicans pursuing an impeachment inquiry in Congress into what they claim is a Biden family criminal conspiracy, although they have provided no evidence that the president did anything wrong.\n\nRepublican politicians have accused Hunter Biden of engaging in corrupt business practices in China and

He allegedly lied to a licensed firearms dealer and made a false claim on a federal gun purchase form by saying he was not an unlawful user of a controlled substance. Hunter is alleged to have kept the gun illegally for 11 days.\n\nHunter's history-making trial opens just four days after his father's likely rival in the upcoming presidential election, Donald Trump, was convicted on 34 felony counts in his own landmark trial in Manhattan. Trump was found guilty of falsifying business records in order to hide a hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels that was designed to protect his 2016 presidential campaign from being damaged by the emergence of Daniels' claims of having an extramarital romp with Trump a decade earlier.\n\nHunter's trial came after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors last year which would have seen him plead guilty to tax charges and enter into a pretrial diversion program on the gun charges. After the deal unraveled, Justice Department special counsel David Weiss brought two prosecutions against Hunter. In addition to the gun case, Hunter is set to face a second trial on tax charges in September in California.\n\nIf convicted in his firearms case, Hunter could theoretically face a sentence of up to 25 years in prison, according to the DOJ, though the department notes that actual sentences are typically more lenient than possible maximum sentences.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ashley Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Cohen_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Cohen Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show_Jumping", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show Jumping", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_576,w_1024,x_0,y_50/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1717425529/GettyImages-2155271935_dlla8z", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

President Biden -- who was first elected to public office in Delaware back in 1971 -- was just in Rehoboth Beach, Del. over the weekend.\n\nRoughly 250 Delaware residents have been summoned for jury selection (though not all of them will necessarily have to show up to court) and that pool will then be narrowed down to 12 jurors and four alternates, according to the judge.\n\nHunter Biden, 54, has pleaded not guilty to three felony counts pertaining to his alleged illegal possession of a firearm while addicted to narcotics.\n\nIt is one of two indictments against him with the second case -- his tax indictment -- slated to commence on Sept. 5 in Los Angeles. He has similarly pleaded not guilty in that case to six misdemeanor and three felony counts for allegedly skimping Uncle Sam of $1.4 million in taxes.\n\nIn a bid to root out a biased jury pool via a process known as voir dire, prospective jurors will be peppered with questions about the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIt's not clear how long jury selection will take, but the full case is expected to last roughly one to two weeks.\n\nDelaware US District Judge Maryellen Noreika, a Trump appointee backed by the state's Democratic senators, is presiding over the firearm case.\n\nShe is the judge who oversaw a plea deal -- on the tax charges and a pretrial diversion agreement on the firearm charges -- that dramatically imploded in a courtroom back in July of last year.\n\nSpecial counsel David Weiss, a rare Trump administration holdover serving as US Attorney for the District of Delaware, is overseeing the prosecution against the scandal-scarred first son.\n\nHunter Biden is being represented by a team of several lawyers, led by well-known defense attorney Abbe Lowell, who has an extensive history of defending famous clientele in the courtroom.\n\nHis firearm case stems back to an Oct. 12, 2018 purchase of a .38 caliber Colt Cobra revolver at a Delaware gun shop. To acquire that handgun, background checks required him to certify that he was not addicted to illicit drugs.\n\nThat year, Hunter Biden was deep in the throes of a crack cocaine addiction, as documented by evidence from his memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" leaked laptop contents and scores of witnesses.\n\nAbout 11 days after the revolver purchase, his sister-in-law turned lover Hallie Biden disposed of it in a trash can near Janssen's Market, right across the street from a high school, according to police records.\n\nAn enraged Hunter Biden demanded she fetch the weapon, which she went to do, only to discover it was no longer there. Police were then called to the scene. The gun was later returned by a man who regularly rummages through trash.\n\nThe first son's trial begins in the aftermath of a Manhattan jury voting to convict former President Donald Trump of 34 counts related to falsification of business documents to conceal hush money payments.\n\nThat conviction sparked a total uproar among congressional Republicans, who have long had Hunter Biden in their crosshairs and alleged that prosecutors initially gave the first son a \"sweetheart\" deal.\n\nPresident Biden, who was with Hunter on Friday, weighed in on the verdict against his rival Trump, saying \"The justice system should be respected, and we should never allow anyone to tear it down.\"\n\nNow the justice system -- led by his own administration -- will evaluate whether his son should be tossed in jail.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person",

He allegedly lied to a licensed firearms dealer and made a false claim on a federal gun purchase form by saying he was not an unlawful user of a controlled substance. Hunter is alleged to have kept the gun illegally for 11 days.\n\nHunter's history-making trial opens just four days after his father's likely rival in the upcoming presidential election, Donald Trump, was convicted on 34 felony counts in his own landmark trial in Manhattan. Trump was found guilty of falsifying business records in order to hide a hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels that was designed to protect his 2016 presidential campaign from being damaged by the emergence of Daniels' claims of having an extramarital romp with Trump a decade earlier.\n\nHunter's trial came after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors last year which would have seen him plead guilty to tax charges and enter into a pretrial diversion program on the gun charges. After the deal unraveled, Justice Department special counsel David Weiss brought two prosecutions against Hunter. In addition to the gun case, Hunter is set to face a second trial on tax charges in September in California.\n\nIf convicted in his firearms case, Hunter could theoretically face a sentence of up to 25 years in prison, according to the DOJ, though the department notes that actual sentences are typically more lenient than possible maximum sentences.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" Biden wrote. \"As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\nAlso present at the trial were several other members of the Biden family, as well as Hunter's longtime patron, Kevin Morris, who has reportedly run out of money after funding Hunter Biden's legal expenses for more than four years.\n\nPresident Biden is expected to leave for a fundraiser in New York on Monday afternoon, before traveling to Paris the following day.", "source": {"uri": "freebeacon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Free Beacon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ian_schwartz@freebeacon.com", "name": "Ian Schwartz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehoboth_Beach,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rehoboth Beach, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rehoboth Beach, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show_Jumping", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show Jumping", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Internet", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual_Addiction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual Addiction", "wgt": 8}], "image": "https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jury-selection-begins-in-hunter-biden-gun-trial-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

An elderly man discovered the items and police later obtained them from him. Authorities placed the items into \"an evidence vault\" and no charges were brought.\n\nSearches of Mr. Biden's account, undertaken as federal agents investigated him for tax crimes, uncovered evidence that led to the firearm charges. That included pictures showing drugs and texts relating to how Mr. Biden was using drugs. He later wrote in his memoir that he was addicted to drugs during the period he bought and owned the revolver.\n\nMaximum prison time on all charges could be up to 25 years (we'll wait for you to catch your breath), and each count carries a maximum fine of $250,000 and three years of unsupervised release.\n\nThe trial begins almost a year after Judge Maryellen Noreika blew up a sweetheart plea deal, which would have conveyed broad immunity to Hunter on a wide swath of unrelated potential criminal charges. The deal sought to cap a five-year investigation into Hunter's tax affairs and business dealings.\n\nAfter the plea deal unraveled, David Weiss requested and was granted \"special counsel\" status by Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutors will not be allowed to let the jury know about Hunter's 2014 discharge from the Navy after testing positive for cocaine, nor his salacious child support case for his out-of-wedlock daughter in Arkansas. Judge Noreika also said that Weiss only has to show that Hunter was addicted to drugs, not that he was on them the day he purchased the gun.\n\nThe prosecution does not plan to bring out the entire infamous laptop containing details of Hunter Biden's life but will introduce certain portions. Noreika ruled that Hunter Biden's team will be able to question aspects of the laptop in front of the jury. The laptop, which leaked in 2020 just before the presidential election, was decried as Russian disinformation by 51 former intelligence officials.\n\nNoreika also ruled that the special counsel cannot mention Hunter Biden's pending federal tax trial in California during the trial in Delaware, which is also part of Weiss's investigation and scheduled for a September trial. -Fox News\n\nIn January, federal prosecutors said that Hunter can't hide behind the 2nd Amendment that Democrats seek to destroy.\n\n\"Anglo-American law has long recognized that the government may disarm those who, by their conduct or characteristics, present an increased risk to public safety if they possess firearms,\" prosecutors said in a Jan. 16 filing. That means a U.S. law against gun ownership by people who use or are addicted to drugs can still stand under the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision that struck down restrictions in New York, they added.\n\nHunter's trial is expected to last around two weeks. He separately faces nine tax-related federal charges in a case scheduled to go to trial in September in Los Angeles.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"},

For no reason,\" the text continued.\n\n\"And I freaked when I saw it was missing 10 minutes after she took it and when she went back to get it after I scared the s**t out of her it was gone which led to state police investigation of me. True story... But really on top of the full open trash can.\"\n\nOne month later, Hunter allegedly repeated the claims in a separate text message conversation with Hallie and the therapist.\n\n\"She stole the gun out of my truck lock box and threw in a garbage can full to the top at Jansens. Then told me it was my problem to deal with,\" he allegedly wrote.\n\n\"Then when the police the FBI the secret service came on the scene, she said she took it from me because she was scared, I would harm myself due to my drug and alcohol problem and our volatile relationship and that she was afraid for the kids.\n\n\"Really not joking the cop kept me convinced that Hallie was implying she was scared of me.\"\n\nAmong the three charges, Hunter stands accused of making false statements in the purchase of a firearm and providing false statements to information required to be kept by a federal firearms licensed dealer.\n\nWhenever an individual attempts to purchase a gun, they are required to complete a form from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives stating they are legally allowed to obtain the weapon.\n\nThis form asks several questions, including whether the individual has ever been convicted of a felony, is a fugitive, in the county unlawfully, was dishonorably discharged or if they have ever been committed to a mental institution.\n\nIt also requires individuals to reveal if they are an \"unlawful user of, or addicted to\" illegal drugs such as marijuana, narcotics, stimulants, or depressants.\n\nAt the time of the alleged gun purchase in October 2018, the president's son allegedly selected \"no\" for these and similar questions, according to the Firearms Transaction Record obtained by CNN.\n\nProsecutors in the trial are reportedly planning to prove Hunter had been using illegal drugs by pointing to the relevant text messages, according to Politico.\n\nHunter has pleaded not guilty over the charges and attempted to secure a plea deal last year, but was unsuccessful.\n\nAt the time, he told District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump, that he had been sober since May 2019.\n\nThe president's son has openly discussed his drug addictions in the past.\n\nWhile not present in court with his son on Monday, President Joe Biden released a statement of support for Hunter, pointing to his recovery.\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us.\n\n\"A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean.\n\n\"As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\n\n\"Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\"\n\nIf convicted of all three felony charges, Hunter could face up to 25 years in prison.\n\nHowever, experts have indicated that he would likely not receive the maximum punishment.\n\nCriminal defense lawyer Peter Tilem told Politico that as Hunter has no prior convictions or arrests, as well as no accusations that he misused the gun, he could face at least 15 months in prison if found guilty.\n\nWhile President Biden does have the power to pardon Hunter of the charges at any time, that is unlikely.\n\nIn July 2023, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the president would consider a pardon.\n\n\"No,\" she said at the time, according to CNN.\n\nThe trial is expected to last between one to two weeks.\n\nJury selection began Monday.\n\nThe final 12-person jury, and four alternates, will be made up of Delaware residents.\n\nHunter also faces nine tax-related charges, including failure to file and pay taxes, and tax evasion in Los Angeles, California.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty.\n\nProsecutors have accused the president's son of spending millions on an extravagant lifestyle instead of paying taxes between 2016 and 2019.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "callie_patteson@the-sun.com", "name": "Callie Patteson", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Those would later be displayed in the House of Representatives by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.\n\n\"I'm... an alcoholic and a drug addict,\" Hunter Biden says in the prologue to his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" written following four years of extreme drug abuse. Writing in USA TODAY last December, Biden, 54, decried the \"weaponization of my addiction by partisan and craven factions.\"\n\nToday, Biden refers to himself as an addict in recovery. But there was a moment in 2018 when Hunter Biden was not an addict, his lawyers say. It was on Oct. 12, when Biden purchased a Colt .38 Special revolver and checked \"No\" on a federal gun form that asked: \"Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?\"\n\nOn Monday, the president's son goes on trial at a federal courthouse in Wilmington over charges he lied on that paperwork. Hunter Biden faces a maximum sentence of 25 years if convicted. The case will hinge in part on whether Biden was legally addicted when he bought the gun - and which definition of the term might prevail with the judge and jury.\n\nMore: Hunter Biden: I fought to get sober. Political weaponization of my addiction hurts more than me.\n\nSubstance abuse professionals - and the law itself - appear split over whether Biden was indeed an addict when he bought that revolver in 2018 and over the evolving meaning of addiction.\n\nThe trial comes as, once again, the younger Biden, who has never held elected or public office, finds himself at the center of a momentous presidential campaign and as a monthslong Republican move to impeach President Joe Biden has fizzled in the House.\n\nIn and out of rehab\n\nIn the fall of 2018, Hunter Biden moved back to the East Coast after months of despairing drug abuse in California. At one point that summer, his uncle, James Biden, had hauled him out of a hotel room and placed him in a rehab center before he moved in with a sobriety coach in the hills over Los Angeles.\n\n\"It was great -- the beauty, the peace, the support -- right up until the moment I relapsed,\" he writes in \"Beautiful Things. \"My lesson after a spring and summer of nonstop debauchery: no lesson at all.\"\n\nBut it was during one of those periods of sobriety that Hunter Biden purchased the handgun and answered honestly on the federal paperwork, his lawyers say.\n\n\"At issue here is Mr. Biden's understanding of the question,\" his lawyer Abbe Lowell recently wrote the court. \"Someone like Mr. Biden, who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nBiden's lawyers haven't specified where and when the 11-day rehab took place, but they are emphatic that Biden could have reasonably considered himself sober as a result of it.\n\n\"Eleven days is a treatment experience. It's not a treatment success,\" said Kevin McEneaney, a former top official at Phoenix House, speaking from 30 years of working with people with substance use disorders. \"It may technically be great for court,\" he added. \"It's not accurate in the world of addiction treatment.\"\n\n\"If he was clean 11 days, I would still be coaching him, 'Hey, you've got a serious condition for the rest of your life.'\" McEneaney said. \"I wouldn't consider him away from his addiction.\"\n\n\"You could argue you are not currently dependent on any substance,\" Maia Szalavitz, the author of several books on addiction, said of Biden's stance. \"I would not consider that honest at that stage. The problem is that the legal concept of addiction is ancient.\"\n\nIs addiction in the eye of the beholder?\n\n\"There used to be a belief, 'Once an addict, always an addict,' \" said Peter Provet, CEO of Odyssey House, a New York drug treatment center. \"It's an old-school belief: Once you had that thing, it was always going to be there, that addictive vulnerability. That point of view may not always be correct.\"\n\nMore: Hunter Biden sues Rudy Giuliani over 'total annihilation' of privacy from release of laptop data\n\nAnd the stigma of addiction remains even in sobriety, with discrimination in employment, professional licensing and socially. \"I stopped using drugs at 18 but I've been labeled an addict for the rest of my life,\" McEneaney said.\n\nMore: FBI informant indicted for lying about Joe and Hunter Biden alleged business dealings\n\nIf the professionals aren't fully in agreement on when and for how long a person remains an \"addict,\" neither is the law.\n\nBiden is charged with violating a statute that is written in the present tense. It is illegal for anyone \"who is an unlawful user of or addicted\" to narcotics to possess a gun.\n\nBut federal prosecutors want to define Biden's addiction using a much broader Treasury Department definition, which considers a person \"an unlawful current user of a controlled substance\" if there is \"a pattern of use or possession that reasonably covers the present time,\" including a failed drug test in the past year.\n\nBiden's lawyers have asked U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika to keep the damaging Treasury definition away from the jury. Noreika's proposed jury instructions, released publicly on Saturday, steer clear of defining addiction. Both sides have until Monday morning to object to her instructions.\n\nHere today, gone tomorrow\n\nJurors are likely to see plenty of evidence of the famous defendant's use of cocaine - including some exhibits with inconvenient dates.\n\nJustice Department special counsel David Weiss has pulled volumes of evidence of Biden's drug use from both his memoir and his iCloud computer backup.\n\nThe exhibits include a message from Oct. 13, 2018 - one day after the gun buy - where Biden allegedly writes that he is \"waiting for a drug dealer named Mookie,\" and another from Oct. 14 in which he describes himself as \"sleeping on a car smoking crack.\"\n\nMore: Not a 'deadbeat dad': Mother of President Biden's seventh grandchild comes to Hunter's defense\n\nLegally, the question of Biden's sobriety may come down to his state of mind on the day he bought the pistol. His lawyers say he never loaded or used the weapon. On Oct. 23, Biden's then-girlfriend - now a prosecution witness - took the gun from his car and tossed it into a trash can outside a Delaware convenience store, where it was retrieved by a man harvesting empty cans and later by the police.\n\n\"It's impossible to get well, no matter what the therapy, unless you commit to it absolutely,\" Biden writes in \"Beautiful Things.\" \"The Alcoholics Anonymous 'Big Book' -- the substance abuse bible, written by group founder Bill Wilson -- makes that clear: 'Half measures availed us nothing.'\"\n\n\"By this point in my life,\" Biden says of those days in 2018, \"I'd written the book on half measures.\"\n\nFrom 'Where's Hunter?' to a public life\n\nIn the end, it wasn't Alcoholics Anonymous, or therapy with the psychoactive root ibogaine, or the psychedelic compound 5-MeO-DMT, taken from the secretions of the Sonoran Desert toad, or the antidepressant ketamine that Hunter Biden ultimately found most helpful.\n\nAfter four years in hell, Biden writes, in May 2019, he fell hard for Melissa Cohen, a South African woman with eyes that matched those of his late brother, Beau. She seized his electronics, flushed his drugs and kept at bay a coterie of toxic hangers-on.\n\nAfter years of addiction Biden says, he found sobriety - and a new wife - in seven days.\n\nAfter being hunted by Trump and his followers, his privacy destroyed by the leaking of the famous laptop's contents, Biden, now happily married, is again a public figure. Where Donald Trump once roared \"Where's Hunter?\" at 2020 reelection rallies, the president's son is often seen at his father's side and at White House events.\n\nMore: Hunter Biden denies Joe Biden involved in family business: 'Destructive political charade'\n\nMore challenges remain. In addition to the federal gun trial, Hunter Biden faces federal charges in California over failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes, which he later paid to the government. The gun and tax charges both stem from a failed plea agreement between Biden and federal prosecutors that collapsed last summer. A trial in the tax case is set to begin Sept. 5 in Los Angeles, just before Joe Biden and Trump are scheduled for a debate.\n\nHunter Biden is also in the middle of a fractious multi-million-dollar alimony case with his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, who is expected to testify for the prosecution at the gun trial.\n\nWhile Biden sometimes uses the language of the recovery moment to describe his addiction, he doesn't write about his own recovery using those terms.\n\n\"He does not see himself in the 12-step lens. He attributes his recovery to falling in love,\" Szalavitz says. \"That is a valid way of recovering.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [],

Biden attorneys are expected in court Friday, May 24, days before the president's son is expected to stand trial on federal firearms charges in Delaware as his father's reelection campaign unfolds. Biden is charged with lying about his drug use in October 2018 on a form to buy a gun that he kept for about 11 days in Delaware.\n\nBy RANDALL CHASE, CLAUDIA LAUER, MICHAEL KUNZELMAN and COLLEEN LONG - Associated Press\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Jury selection is to begin Monday in a federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election.\n\nHunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his father, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nPeople are also reading...

A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.\n\nThe judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.\n\nShe's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: \"Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of Hunter Biden at https://apnews.com/hub/hunter-biden.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- The judge overseeing Hunter Biden 's federal firearms charges trial agreed Friday to block prosecutors from telling jurors about some other unflattering episodes from his personal life, but left the door open to allowing them in if the president's son testifies.\n\nIt's unclear whether the president's son would take the stand during the trial that could last up to two weeks during his father's reelection campaign and likely include sharp disagreements over evidence.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's son is charged with lying about his drug use in October 2018 on a form to buy a gun that he kept for about 11 days in Delaware. A trial is set to begin June 3 and could last up to two weeks as his father's re-election campaign unfolds.\n\nHunter Biden has acknowledged an addiction to crack cocaine during that period, but his lawyers have said he didn't break the law and the case is politically motivated. He didn't speak to reporters as he accompanied his lawyers to and from the Wilmington courthouse for a hearing on Friday.\n\nProsecutors won a victory on a key point as U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika found that they wouldn't have to prove that he specifically used drugs on the day of the purchase.\n\nShe agreed to a defense push to keep out other details about his past, including a child-support case in Arkansas and his dismissal from the Navy after a positive drug test. If he does take the stand, however, \"there's a number of issues that may become more contentious,\" Noreika said. Prosecutors have acknowledged those episodes likely won't be relevant unless he testifies.\n\nShe also agreed to consider defense questions about the contents of a laptop that he allegedly dropped off at a Delaware repair shop.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys want to raise questions about the authenticity of the laptop's data at trial. Prosecutors say that there's no evidence it has been compromised and that a drawn-out fight would be a waste of time. The laptop has been the source of controversy for years after Republicans accessed and disseminated personal data from it.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika said she will consider objections to specific pieces of data as the trial unfolds.\n\nProsecutors also plan to show jurors portions of his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things,\" in which he detailed his struggle with alcoholism and drug abuse following the 2015 death of his older brother, Beau, of brain cancer at age 46.\n\nDefense attorneys argued prosecutors were cherry-picking evidence, and the judge agreed to allow Biden's attorneys to introduce wider selections.\n\nHis attorney Abbe Lowell also says there are indications that the gun-purchase form was changed by employees after the sale. Prosecutors say there were only minor additions unrelated to the parts Hunter Biden filled out.\n\nNoreika didn't immediately rule on whether the defense could introduce an altered version of the form at trial, which is expected to begin with jury selection on June 3.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing federal tax charges in Los Angeles and is set for trial in that case in September. He's accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over four years while living an \"extravagant lifestyle\" during a period in which he has acknowledged struggling with addiction. The back taxes have since been paid.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have pushed unsuccessfully in both cases to have them dismissed. They have argued, among other things, that prosecutors bowed to political pressure to indict him after a plea agreement hit the skids in court and was publicly pilloried by Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, as a \"sweetheart deal.\"\n\nTrump, who is running to unseat the Democratic president, faces his own legal problems. He is charged in four criminal cases, including a hush money trial underway in New York.\n\nThe long-running federal investigation into the president's son had looked ready to wrap up with a plea deal last year, but the agreement imploded after a judge raised questions about it. Hunter Biden was subsequently indicted.\n\nUnder the deal, he would have gotten two years of probation after pleading guilty to misdemeanor tax charges. He also would have avoided prosecution on the gun charge if he stayed out of trouble.\n\n___\n\nWhitehurst reported from Washington.

For Dailymail.Com\n\nHunter Biden will be in federal court Monday as the defendant in a bombshell federal gun crimes trial that could span over a week.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's scandal-plagued son, 54, is charged with lying about his crack cocaine addiction in October 2018 on a form to buy a gun in Delaware. He has pleaded not guilty and his lawyers insist he didn't break the law and say the case is politically motivated.\n\nOn Monday, the jury selection process will begin at 9 a.m. ET and kick off his trial. If found guilty, Hunter faces up to 25 years in prison on the charges.\n\nHe was all smiles earlier this month when entering the courthouse for a hearing, but his legal woes are becoming a headache for Joe's re-election campaign.\n\nHunter is also facing federal tax charges in Los Angeles and is set for trial in that case in September - just weeks before the presidential election.\n\nDailyMail.com breaks down all of the evidence that prosecutions plan to present in court:\n\nPresident Joe Biden 's scandal-plagued son is charged with lying about being addicted to drugs in October 2018 on a form to buy a gun in Delaware\n\nThe firearm report that Hunter allegedly lied on\n\nAt the center of the case is a firearm report that is required for a gun transaction.\n\nHe is accused by Special Counsel David Weiss' team of hiding his cocaine addiction on a form when he bought a Colt Cobra revolver for $900 in Delaware in October 2018.\n\nA photo of the form shows Hunter answered 'no' when asked if he was an 'unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.'\n\nIf he had answered 'yes,' he would not have been able to buy the gun.\n\nBut at the time, Hunter was addicted to crack cocaine, according to a memoir published years later.\n\nThe Colt Cobra cost $886.81, so Hunter handed over $900 in cash, prosecutors allege.\n\nHunter allegedly lied on a firearm report (above) required for his gun transaction. A photo of the form shows he answered 'no' when asked if he was an 'unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance'\n\nThe Colt Cobra gun Hunter Biden allegedly bought illegally while addicted to drugs has been pictured for the first time in a scathing court filing from prosecutors\n\nGun tossed in the trash by Hallie Biden\n\nEleven days after he filled out the form, his then-girlfriend Hallie Biden - the widow of his late brother Beau - found the weapon in his car with the windows down.\n\nAlongside it were the speedloader and the ammunition. She threw the gun in a trash can at the Janssens Supermarket in Wilmington, across the road from a high school.\n\n'The police later obtained the gun case from the defendant and obtained the defendant's gun, the ammunition contained in the ammo box, speed loader, and brown leather pouch from the older man,' prosecutors have said.\n\nDailyMail.com reported exclusively that Hunter tried to blame the missing gun on Mexican workers.\n\nThe First Son made the controversial comments in October 2018 while being interviewed by state police looking for his handgun and bullets after Hallie threw them out.\n\nText messages with Hallie about the gun disposal\n\nTexts from the day Hallie Biden discarded the firearm in front of a Wilmington grocery store are also expected to come up in court.\n\n'Are you insane. This is no game. And you're being totally irresponsible and unhinged,' one text message reads from October 23, 2018.\n\nIn a follow-up text, he blasts her for disposing of the gun.\n\n'Who in their right mind would trust you would help me get sober?' Hunter asks, referencing that he had an encounter with the FBI over the gun.\n\nThe DOJ document notes that the texts came after his 'interactions with law enforcement.'\n\nA response from Hunter's 'girlfriend' read: 'I'm sorry, I just want you to be safe. That was not safe.'\n\n'And it was open unlocked and windows down and the kids search your car,' she continued.\n\n'You have lost your mind hunter.

to protect President Biden.\n\nHowever, the plea deal spectacularly fell apart in court in July, opening Hunter up to new charges.\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika questioned the 'diversion agreement' of Hunter's plea deal - a clause that gave him blanket immunity for a wide range of other potential charges, including illegal foreign lobbying - killing the deal.\n\nIn August, Attorney General Merrick Garland elevated Weiss to special counsel status after increased scrutiny.\n\nGarland's decision to promote Weiss came after IRS whistleblower allegations that Hunter received 'special treatment'

(AP) -- A federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter opened Monday with jury selection, following the collapse of a plea deal that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden was seated in the front row of the courtroom, in a show of support for her son.\n\nIn a statement, the president said he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants by saying he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nIn Delaware, prospective jurors who answered \"yes\" on a questionnaire were quizzed individually by Judge Maryellen Noreika to determine whether they could be fair and impartial. One by one, they were dismissed, winnowing down the pool.\n\nThe questions ranged from their knowledge of the case to their thoughts about gun ownership and whether they or anyone close to them have struggled with substance abuse or addiction or ever owned a gun. Other questions focused on the role politics may have played in the charges.\n\nOne prospective juror said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she replied when an attorney asked her opinion. Another prospective juror was dismissed because his family has a long history in law enforcement, and he said he could not be impartial. A third was excused because he was very aware of the case, and, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nOnly one potential juror answered \"no\" to all the questions and moved on to the next phase. Another who was not dismissed said he holds a concealed carry permit and owns three handguns. The man said he has strong views on gun ownership and believes every law-abiding citizen should be able to own a gun.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"I believe the Second Amendment is very important,\" he explained.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nThis trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs -- which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.\n\nPresident Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.\n\nHunter Biden arrived first to the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court, and his wife Melissa. The president in Wilmington until he left for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAllies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked \"no\" to the question on the form. They will also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.\n\nIf convicted, he faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nLong reported from Washington.

The proceeding will include testimony by a former Delaware State Police official who investigated that incident, as well as the person who trashed the gun: Biden's then-lover and widow of his late brother.\n\nIt will also include testimony from workers from a gun store on U.S. 202 in Talleyville, a shop that now finds itself at the center of criticisms by Hunter Biden's defense attorneys for seemingly committing a similar paperwork infraction that led to Biden's criminal charges.\n\nIt all started with an odd incident involving Hunter Biden and Hallie Biden at Janssen's in October 2018, an incident that would escape the public eye for years.\n\nA Delaware State Police investigative report from 2018 included in court filings details the investigation into the incident, as well as interviews with Hunter Biden and Hallie Biden - the widow of Hunter Biden's brother, the late Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden. At the time of the Janssen's incident, she was Hunter Biden's lover.\n\nThe police report isn't clear on who summoned State Police to the grocery store, though it appears from the redacted copy included in court documents that it was a store employee. Police arrived and found Hallie Biden in the store's office. She told officers she took her children to school that morning and returned home and searched Hunter Biden's vehicle, locating the handgun in the center console.\n\nShe put it in a bag and later drove to Janssen's and threw the bag and the gun in the trash outside the store, she told officers. Hunter Biden had left by the time she returned and she called him to confront him about the gun. She said Hunter Biden became upset and implored her to drive back and retrieve it.\n\nBut when she returned, the gun was no longer in the trash. She got nervous and approached the store owner to confess. The officer wrote that Hallie Biden \"danced around\" questions about why she searched Hunter Biden's car and later stated she thought he was \"screwing around on me.\"\n\n\"She was kind of all over the place,\" the officer wrote.\n\nRecent: Hunter Biden trial begins Monday in Wilmington: What you need to know about the case\n\nIn the presence of the officers, she then called Hunter Biden and told him the officer wished to speak to him. He arrived half an hour later.\n\nHe told the officer he was in a relationship with Hallie Biden, sometimes stayed at her home nearby but still lived in Washington D.C. He claimed he woke up at her home that morning and began to drive to Washington D.C. when he noticed the gun was missing and he called Hallie Biden, who admitted to tossing the gun in the trash.\n\nHe said he purchased it for target practice but had not shot it. The officer wrote that he told Hunter Biden that Hallie Biden was not very forthcoming and asked him if the gun had been used in a crime.\n\n\"He became very agitated with me and asked if I was intentionally trying to make him mad,\" the officer wrote.\n\nBiden also asked whether he should call an attorney. The officer emphasized that his interest was simply in locating the gun to protect children, as A.I. du Pont High School is right across the street.\n\nAttention then focused on who might have retrieved the gun from the trash.\n\nHunter Biden told him Hallie Biden had mentioned noticing a \"homeless man\" collecting cans and speculated he may have the gun. Employees of the store and officers said they had also noticed the man in the past.\n\nThe officer wrote that two \"Mexican males\" then passed them wearing Janssen's Market shirts and Hunter Biden stated \"they have some shady people working at the market\" and referred to the men as \"prolly illegal.\"\n\nThe officer later asked if he had told his father about this. Hunter Biden said, \"I have never called my dad for anything.\" He also speculated that Hallie Biden searched his car because she was worried he might harm himself.\n\nEventually, officers would focus on finding the man known for plundering the grocery store's garbage.\n\nAbout a week later, officers were able to locate the man with the help of a worker at another local store that the man frequented. They watched as he spent about an hour rummaging through trash receptacles in the Greenville Crossing Shopping Center and approached as he loaded the loot into the back of his car.\n\nHe told them he routinely collects recyclables to trade for cash when he goes to New York. Conversation then turned to someone putting something in the trash that shouldn't have been there recently.\n\n\"Yes, they did,\" the man responded. \"A .38 special.\"\n\nRecent: What is an 'addict'? Hunter Biden is fighting what that means as gun trial looms\n\nHe then took officers back to his home where he had stashed the gun in a sock inside a box. The officer wrote that the man could not provide a reason why he didn't report the gun to police, but told them he would alert authorities if he ever came across another in the trash.\n\nHe also gave officers another gun that he said his co-worker had given him many years ago with the understanding that it belonged to his co-worker's brother, \"who was in some kind of trouble and needed to get rid of the gun,\" according to the police report.\n\nThe officer called Hunter Biden to report the gun's recovery and wrote that Hunter Biden was firm that there should be no prosecution in the case.\n\n\"The whole thing is just stupid,\" the officer quotes Hunter Biden saying.\n\nProsecutors in the Delaware Department of Justice were consulted and decided the case didn't warrant any sort of criminal prosecution, according to the police report.\n\nIn addition to testimony from Hallie Biden, Millard Greer, a former state police officer who authored the final investigative report on the incident included in court files, is expected to testify. He has since taken a job as an investigator in the Delaware Department of Justice unit tasked with policing public corruption.\n\nThis incident was first reported by the conservative news website The Blaze in 2020. Their report was built on anonymous law enforcement sources.\n\nPolitico followed up on the story with a leaked copy of the Delaware State Police report, a document typically kept secret by state officials and shielded by Delaware's restrictive public records law. The Politico story focused on a curious ripple: both state police investigators, as well as the Secret Service, had contacted the Delaware gun shop about the paperwork Hunter Biden filled out in purchasing the gun.\n\nThis was odd because Joe Biden was in between his term as Vice President and becoming the Democratic nominee for president, so he and his family were not under Secret Service protection, Politico reported.\n\nIn a recent interview with federal authorities, the owner of the gun shop reiterated that both State Police and the Secret Service separately contacted him shortly after Hunter Biden's gun had gone missing. He said they seemed to not be aware of the other's investigation. In the interview, the owner said the request from the Secret Service \"didn't feel right\" so he only gave the form to State Police investigators at the time.\n\nWhile the trash can incident explains how the gun purchase came to the attention of federal investigators, it was the actual purchase that has Hunter Biden facing the potential of decades in prison.\n\nThe gun, a Colt .38 special revolver, was purchased from StarQuest Shooters & Survival Supply store on Concord Pike in October 2018, a few weeks before the Janssen's incident.\n\nThe store is owned by Ron Palimere, who through the years has been quoted in Delaware Online/The News Journal about gun safety laws and doomsday prep. Attempts to reach him through the store and his email were unsuccessful.\n\nProsecutors intend to call another employee of the store, Gordon Cleveland, to testify about the transaction with Hunter Biden. Cleveland is expected to testify that he watched Hunter Biden fill out what is known as ATF form 4473. On it, prosecutors contend that Hunter Biden stated that he was not an unlawful user of or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nProsecutors contend that statement is false and it is the foundation of two of the criminal charges against Hunter Biden.\n\nMeanwhile, Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden's primary defense attorney, last week signaled his intent to call Palimere to the stand to discuss differences between a copy of the ATF form emailed to federal authorities shortly after the purchase and the original that federal officials took possession of three years later.\n\nThe original that federal officials took possession of more recently had additions including \"DE Vehicle Registration\" written into a box for supplemental government-issued documentation. There were no alleged changes to the specific portion that Hunter Biden filled out.\n\nLowell noted the \"doctored\" form in a pretrial hearing earlier this month, prompting prosecutors and FBI agents to interview Palimere and include a transcript in court filings seeking to keep what they describe as the \"annotated\" form out of evidence.\n\nPalimere told agents that he also owned a consignment store next door and believed he was called from there to the gun shop when employees recognized Biden as a \"celebrity-type customer.\"\n\nHe remained in the back of the store and the salesman said Biden wanted to use his passport for identification, not a driver's license, which is typical. Passports don't typically contain a person's home address, but Palmiere blessed the use of the passport, according to the interview report.\n\n\"Palimere was familiar with Biden's father's not being a gun supporter so Palimere thought it would be bad for Palimere's business to have Hunter Biden seen in his store,\" the report states. \"Palimere wanted to get the sale completed and get Biden out of the store.\"\n\nHe added that the fact that the \"Biden family home was so well known\" and his lack of knowledge about the details of a passport caused him to have incomplete information on the form. He didn't handle the form for three years until a federal agent requested the original be turned over.\n\nAfter he was contacted, he reviewed the form and another employee brought up that it needed to be annotated.\n\n\"Palimere decided to write Delaware registration in the box,\" the interview summation states. \"Palimere does not know why that was chosen but he knew it had to be an official document and it was all they could think of.\"\n\nIt adds that Palimere told authorities he doesn't think that Hunter Biden actually showed his vehicle registration the day he bought the gun. The interview report notes that federal authorities allow for forms to be annotated after the fact, which would typically involve calling the customer and having them show documents regarding their residency.\n\n\"Palimere was not about to call Biden. Palimere felt they could not have him come into the store,\" the report states. \"Plus, Palimere did not want to contact Biden and tell him he needed to come in and he was being investigated.\"\n\nLowell has sought to make the annotation a feature of Hunter Biden's defense.\n\nIn arguing for the edited form to be admitted, he said it speaks to the credibility of those testifying that Hunter Biden filled out the form and is also relevant to explore any benefit the witnesses received by prosecutors disregarding potentially incorrect information they put on the form.\n\nIn arguing to keep the edited form out of evidence, prosecutors argued it would confuse the jury and changes to the form after the fact are not relevant.\n\nAs of Friday, Presiding Judge Maryellen Norieka had not ruled whether the annotated form will be allowed into evidence.\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

Biden has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nThe charges include: false statement in purchase of a firearm; false statement related to information required to be kept by federal firearms licensed dealer; possession of a firearm by a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance.\n\nThe total maximum prison time for the charges could be up to 25 years. Each count carries a maximum fine of $250,000, and three years of supervised release.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN IS IN COURT IN DELAWARE. HERE'S WHAT HE DOESN'T WANT THE JURY TO HEAR\n\nBiden has had well-documented and admitted struggles with addiction, most notably with crack cocaine. He has since gone into recovery and has been sober since 2019, according to sworn testimony in federal court last year.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nProsecutors allege that in October 2018, Biden visited StarQuest Shooters & Survival Supply in Wilmington to purchase the Colt revolver, but say he lied about his drug addiction when he filled out a form for federal authorities to purchase the gun. Biden's form was ticked \"No\" when asked if he is an unlawful user of a firearm or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nJUDGE BARS PROSECUTORS FROM USING SOME SALACIOUS EVIDENCE IN HUNTER BIDEN'S GUN TRIAL\n\nFor the two charges related to the form, prosecutors in the case are working to prove to the jury that Biden filled out the form and knowingly made a false statement, and that he knowingly made the false statement because he believed he would not be able to purchase the gun otherwise. For the third charge, which relates to Biden's possession of a firearm while allegedly addicted to substances, prosecutors must prove that Biden was an unlawful user of a firearm or addicted to drugs, and that he knowingly possessed the firearm as an unlawful user or while addicted to drugs.\n\n\"Maybe it's the ultimate test for a recovering addict - I don't know,\" Biden told Axios earlier this year regarding the importance of his sobriety ahead of his dad's second election faceoff against former President Trump.\n\n\"I have always been in awe of people who have stayed clean and sober through tragedies and obstacles few people ever face. They are my heroes, my inspiration.\"\n\nPretrial motions are currently hashing out the definitions of \"addict\" and \"unlawful user\" to provide to the jury ahead of eventual jury deliberations.\n\nBiden has repeatedly acknowledged his addiction struggles, most notably in his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things: A Memoir.\"\n\n\"I spent more time on my hands and knees picking through rugs smoking anything that even remotely resembled crack cocaine. I probably smoked more parmesan cheese than anyone you know,\" he said during an interview promoting the book.\n\n\"I went one time for 13 days without sleeping, and smoking crack and drinking vodka throughout that entire time,\" he added.\n\nHe previously said his addictions stretch back years, including in the early 2000s when he began heavily drinking while working at law and lobbying firm Oldaker, Biden & Belair, the New York Times reported. In 2014, he was discharged from the Navy Reserves after he tested positive for cocaine use, while following his brother's death in 2015, he reported a return to the use of alcohol.\n\nIn 2016, Biden said his addiction to drugs spiraled, with him using crack cocaine, and going through a tumultuous divorce with his wife of 24 years, the New York Times reported.\n\nBiden's defense team had worked to toss the Delaware case in the lead-up to the trial, including a last-ditch effort that was denied by the court last week. The defense team has argued Biden had just completed a rehab program before the gun purchase and was not an active drug user at the time.\n\n\"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict,\" Biden attorney Abbe Lowell wrote in court documents.\n\nBiden was in possession of the firearm for about 11 days before police responded to a dumpster behind a shopping market, where they found the revolver, Fox News Digital previously reported. Biden was in a relationship with his late brother's widow at the time, Hallie Biden, who allegedly threw the gun in the dumpster.\n\nAMERICANS GUILTY OF CHARGES SIMILAR TO HUNTER NEVER GOT 'SWEETHEART' DEAL TO KEEP THEM FROM PRISON: CRITICS\n\nHallie Biden might be required to testify in the trial, and reportedly had an unexpected late-night visit from the president last month in the lead-up to the trial.\n\nThe White House said the president did not discuss the trial with Hallie, instead visiting her \"because of the approaching 9th anniversary of Beau's passing,\" the New York Post reported. Beau Biden, Hallie Biden's deceased husband and the president's eldest son, died of brain cancer on May 30, 2015.\n\nHunter Biden is now married to Melissa Cohen, whom he has credited with helping him overcome his drug addiction.\n\n\"The decision never felt rash or harebrained or reckless. It felt urgent,\" Biden wrote in his memoir of his marriage to Cohen in 2019. \"It felt like I'd been given a reprieve. I felt the astonishing luck of a man who'd agreed to meet a woman for coffee when it was all but impossible for him to leave a hotel room without a crack pipe in his hand, and who fell in love at first sight.\"\n\nThe trial will kick off on Monday with jury selection. Lowell has slammed the case as one that \"selectively charged\" Biden for political purposes, pointing to U.S. Attorney David Weiss, who is serving as special counsel in the case.\n\nWeiss was nominated to serve as U.S. attorney for the United States District Court for the District of Delaware by former President Trump, after the state's two Democratic senators, Chris Coons and Tom Carper, urged his nomination. Biden retained him in the position after assuming the White House. He also served as interim U.S. attorney under President Barack Obama.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN CRIMINAL TAX CASE ASSIGNED TO TRUMP-APPOINTED JUDGE IN DELAWARE\n\nFEDERAL COURT DENIES HUNTER BIDEN APPEAL IN DELAWARE FEDERAL GUN CHARGES CASE\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika will preside over the case. Trump nominated Noreika as a U.S. district judge in 2017, with the judge also garnering support from Democratic lawmakers. Fox News Digital previously reported she has donated at least $15,000 to political candidates of both parties since 1999.\n\nUpon her nomination, Noreika received support and praise from Democrats in the state, including Coons and Carper.\n\n\"Delaware's courts are renowned for their judges' expertise. Maryellen Noreika and Colm Connolly are two highly-respected, sought-after attorneys who have displayed a vast knowledge of the law and a thorough understanding of the courts during their extensive careers working in the Delaware judicial system,\" Carper said of Noreika's nomination in December 2017.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN SCHEDULED TO MAKE FIRST COURT APPEARANCE ON FEDERAL TAX CHARGES IN JULY\n\nThe trial is anticipated to last at least a week, and will not be televised. Biden is also facing a criminal tax trial in California, which will begin in September, after he was charged with three felonies and six misdemeanors regarding $1.4 million in owed taxes. The taxes have since been paid. Biden has pleaded not guilty in that case.\n\nThe trial follows the unprecedented NY v. Trump trial, which found the 45th president guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. Following the verdict, Biden highlighted that \"no one is above the law.\"\n\n\"The American principle that no one is above the law was reaffirmed. Donald Trump was given every opportunity to defend himself. It was a state case, not a federal case. And it was heard by a jury of 12 citizens, 12 Americans, 12 people like you, like millions of Americans who've served on juries,\" Biden said at the White House. \"This jury is chosen the same way every jury in America is chosen. It was the process that Donald Trump's attorney was part of.\"\n\nOriginal article source: Hunter Biden's drug use: What the prosecution needs to prove and what we already know", "source": {"uri":

of a judge's gavel in Delaware, Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden, will become the first child of a sitting president to be a criminal defendant.\n\nProsecutors allege that the younger Biden, 54, lied about his drug use on application forms when he purchased a handgun in 2018.\n\nHe faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted of the three federal counts, in a case that will get under way on Monday with jury selection.\n\nMr Biden has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nThe trial - which comes as his father campaigns for re-election - is likely to see prosecutors delve into graphic details of Mr Biden's crack cocaine addiction, potentially providing fodder for the president's political foes.\n\nHere is what we know about the case.\n\nMr Biden is facing three federal charges in the case: two counts of making false statements and one count of illegal gun possession.\n\nThe charges all relate to his purchase of a revolver at a Delaware gun store in October 2018, which he kept for about 11 days.\n\nBy Mr Biden's own admission, he was deep in the throes of a \"full blown addiction\" to crack cocaine at the time.\n\nThe two false statement charges stem from allegations that he lied about his drug use on a federally-mandated form when he purchased the weapon.\n\nSpecifically, prosecutors allege that he falsely claimed that he was \"not an unlawful user of and addicted to any stimulant narcotic drug\" when he purchased a Colt Cobra Special revolver.\n\nThe third count is related to his possession of a firearm while alleged to have been a drug user.\n\nThe gun was discarded and discovered at a grocery store in Greenville, Delaware, prompting an investigation that ultimately led investigators back to the forms.\n\nTo convict Mr Biden, prosecutors will have to convince jurors that he knowingly made false statements on the form in a bid to deceive the store that sold him the pistol.\n\nAdditionally, they will have to prove that Mr Biden was a drug user or addicted to drugs, and took possession of the gun despite knowing as much.\n\nUS District Judge Maryellen Noreika has already ruled that defence lawyers cannot argue that the prosecution can only get a guilty verdict by proving Mr Biden was using drugs on the day he bought the weapon.\n\nInstead, in a pre-trial hearing, the judge agreed with prosecutors' argument that they need only prove that \"unlawful use (had) occurred recently enough to indicate that the individual (was) actively engaged in such conduct\".\n\nIn court filings made ahead of the trial's start, prosecutors suggested that they would rely, in part, on deeply personal text messages and other communications made while Mr Biden was in the throes of addiction.\n\nIn one such text message cited in court documents, Mr Biden refers to himself as a \"liar and a thief and a blame and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know\".\n\nThe prosecution is also expected to rely on the testimonies of witnesses including ex-wife Kathleen Buhle and Mr Biden's ex-partner Hallie Biden - who is also the widow of Mr Biden's brother Beau.\n\nProsecutors will also be able to point to Mr Biden's own 2021 memoir, in which he detailed his experiences as a drug user who was \"up twenty-four hours a day, smoking every 15 minutes, seven days a week\".\n\n\"All my energy revolved around smoking drugs and making arrangements to buy drugs - feeding the beast,\" he wrote in the book.\n\nWhile Mr Biden has himself been quiet about the trial, legal documents filed by his lawyers suggest that they will focus on how much Mr Biden was aware of his addiction at the end of the purchase, and on the quality of the evidence itself.\n\nHis primary attorney, Abbe Lowell, has sought permission from the court to call upon an expert witness who can testify about an addict's understanding of their substance abuse issues.\n\n\"Someone, like Mr, Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict,\" Mr Lowell wrote.\n\nAmong the most prominent pieces of evidence at the trial is likely to be the information on Mr Biden's infamous laptop, which has been the focus of intense media speculation and focus from conservative news outlets.\n\nThe laptop has also been at the centre of unproven theories linking Mr Biden and his father to corruption, which they both deny.\n\nMr Biden's own lawyers have argued that the computer was tampered with before it fell into the hands of investigators.\n\nThe special counsel appointed to oversee the probes into Hunter Biden, David Weiss, has said that the tampering argument is a \"conspiracy theory\" with \"no supporting evidence.\"\n\nIn a May filing, prosecutors wrote that the laptop contained \"significant evidence\" of Mr Biden's guilt.\n\nThe two false statement charges each carry a maximum sentence of up to 10 years, while the third count is punishable by up to five years - meaning that Mr Biden could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted.\n\nActual sentences for federal crimes, however, are typically less than the maximum penalties specified by law.\n\nIf Mr Biden is convicted, the judge in the case will ultimately determine the sentence after considering sentencing guidelines and a variety of other legal factors.\n\nIn addition to the gun charges in Delaware, Mr Biden is facing separate federal charges in California over allegations that he evaded a tax assessment, failed to properly file and pay taxes and filed a fraudulent tax return.\n\nSeveral months after the spectacular collapse of a plea deal that would address both sets of charges last year, Mr Biden also pleaded not guilty to the tax charges.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person",

Caleb Boggs Federal Building in downtown Wilmington for the start of Hunter Biden's will go on trial this week on federal gun charges.\n\nJury selection starts today, with court convening at 8:30 a.m. local time.\n\nThree tents for broadcast stations were set up near the court. A heavy police presence is visible, with several police cars parked along North King Street, which runs along one side the building.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security dog walked up and down the line of reporters, sniffing their bags.\n\nBoggs, the building's late namesake, was a former Republican governor who lost his Senate seat in a 1972 squeaker to Joe Biden.\n\nHunter Biden won't be able to introduce a second federal form during his trial on charges he illegally bought and possessed a gun while addicted to drugs, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika ruled Sunday.\n\nThe president's son is charged with lying on the form and lying to the gun dealer about his drug usage when he bought a .38-caliber pistol in 2018 and had it for 11 days.\n\nOn the initial form submitted to federal authorities soon after buying the gun, Biden put an X next to a question asking if he used narcotics or was addicted to them. The second version of the form was submitted to investigators in 2021 with additional information attached that said Biden submitted his vehicle registration when he bought the gun, which apparently wasn't the case, according to court statements.\n\nBiden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, sought to question the gun shop owner about the second form, arguing he apparently filled out the form inaccurately, which is the charge against Biden. But prosecutors argued the second form is \"irrelevant\" and would confuse jurors. Noreika agreed and barred the form from trial, in one of two rulings Sunday against the defense.\n\n-Xerxes Wilson\n\nMore: These are the people, places that will take center stage in Hunter Biden's trial\n\nJudge bars defense expert on drug addiction from trial\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika barred testimony from one of Hunter Biden's proposed expert witnesses, who the defense sought to give a perspective about how people suffering drug addiction view themselves.\n\nDefense lawyers sought to have Elie Aoun, an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry, to testify to testify about how people who have participated in rehabilitation programs are sometimes in denial about their addiction and view themselves as no longer addicted when they complete a program.\n\nBut Noreika barred the witness Sunday, in one of two decisions against the dense, by ruling the defense failed to provide prosecutors with a proper explanation about what expert opinions Aoun would offer.\n\nBiden's defense also sought testimony from Michael Coyer, a forensic toxicologist, to answer questions about items including a white residue on a brown leather gun pouch that tested positive for cocaine years after it was taken into police custody. Noreika ruled that she would hear from Coyer without the jury present before deciding whether to allow him to testify.\n\nThe first two relate specifically to the form he filled out to purchase a gun in 2018, accusing Biden of lying about this drug use on the form.\n\nThe third charge pertains to Biden's possession of a firearm while he was allegedly an unlawful user or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nThe charges carry a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison, though Biden is likely to get a shorter sentence if convicted.

He pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe beginning of Biden's trial comes just days after the conclusion of a criminal trial against the man his father is running against in the presidential race, former President Donald Trump. Trump was convicted of all 34 counts against him in state court in New York.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika said she plans on calling potential jurors in groups of 50 until they're able to find 12 people who say they can be impartial when it comes to the president's son.\n\nAccording to a court filing, among the questions she plans to ask potential jurors in the Wilmington courthouse are, \"Do your views regarding the 2024 election or of any of the candidates for president in any way prevent you from being a fair and impartial juror in this case,\" and \"Do you believe Robert Hunter Biden is being prosecuted in this case because his father is the President of the United States and a candidate for President?\" Another asks if they believe he \"is not being prosecuted for other crimes because his father is the President of the United States.\"\n\nConservative critics of the president have long sought to use his son's legal issues against him. The president has denied any involvement in his son's legal troubles or business matters, and efforts but the Republican-led impeachment inquiry to find evidence of wrongdoing by the president have come up short.\n\nOther questions relate to jurors' views on guns, including \"Do you believe that all people should be permitted by law to buy or possess a firearm regardless of whether they have been or are a user of a controlled substance or addicted to a controlled substance?\" Another asks, \"Do you believe that the government should not be able to require a background check for a gun purchase?\"\n\nTwo of the counts accuse Biden of having completed a form indicating he was not using illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra revolver in Oct. 2018. The third count alleges he possessed a firearm while using a narcotic. The indictment said Biden certified on a federally mandated form \"that he was not an unlawful user of, and addicted to, any stimulant, narcotic drug, and any other controlled substance, when in fact, as he knew, that statement was false and fictitious.\"\n\nProsecutors from special counsel David Weiss's office say they plan to call around 12 witnesses. Among the witnesses they're expected to call are Hunter Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, and his late brother's widow, Hallie Olivere Biden.\n\nProsecutors are also expected to use portions of Hunter Biden's memoir \"Beautiful Things\" as evidence against him, as well as a summary of data from his phone and iPad.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has said that he wants to call the owner of the gun shop as a witness, and would also like to call two to three expert witnesses. Weiss's office has challenged the testimony of some of the experts.\n\nThe trial is expected to last two weeks, the judge, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, has said.\n\nAt a May hearing, Noreika ruled that prosecutors would not be able to mention their other pending case against Hunter Biden in California, where he's facing nine tax-related charges. He's pleaded not guilty in that case, which is scheduled to go to trial on Sept. 5.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Controlled substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_inquiry_against_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Buhle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kathleen Buhle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbe_Lowell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abbe Lowell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revolver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Regulatory_and_Legal", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Regulatory and Legal", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-05/240531-hunter-biden-delaware-aa-303p-b687f7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-05", "textStart": 3358, "textEnd": 3365}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-", "textStart": 2015, "textEnd": 2024}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

He is charged with three felony counts related to his purchase and brief possession of a firearm in 2018, while he was allegedly using illicit drugs.\n\nA child of a sitting American president has never faced a criminal trial before -- a milestone made more dramatic in the context of federal charges.\n\nTrump-appointed U.S. Attorney David Weiss began investigating Hunter in 2018, during Trump's presidency. Weiss was asked to continue the investigation after Joe Biden was elected, and in August 2023, Attorney General Merrick Garland boosted Weiss to special counsel status.\n\nIn September, a federal grand jury in Wilmington, Del., approved a three-count indictment against Hunter related to his possession of a firearm.\n\nTwo counts allege that Hunter lied on forms in order to obtain a revolver in 2018, by stating that he wasn't using illegal drugs at the time. A third count alleges that Hunter, who has been open about his addiction issues, possessed the revolver while using a narcotic.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Hunter owned the gun for 11 days before his girlfriend threw it in a dumpster, citing concerns about his mental health.\n\nTrump-appointed District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who is presiding over Hunter's case, summoned 250 Delaware residents to report for jury duty on Monday. In the end, 12 of them will be seated on the jury and four will be selected as alternates.\n\nThe trial is expected to last one to two weeks, and if jurors ultimately convict Hunter, he faces up to 25 years in prison.\n\nHunter also faces nine federal tax charges related to alleged tax evasion, which could result in a 17-year prison sentence if he's convicted.

His memoirs say he was abusing crack cocaine during this period. The First Son is accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, falsely claiming he was not a drug abuser on his firearm application, and possessing the gun illegally for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty, alleging the Justice Department is unfairly targeting him despite the special treatment in his now-defunct plea deal.\n\nDuring jury selection, the judge will question prospective jurors about their political activities and views on the upcoming election, as well as their opinions on firearms purchases and drug addiction.\n\nSeparately, Hunter is also facing a California trial in September for allegedly failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. The aforementioned plea deal would have dealt with these charges as well.\n\nHunter's upcoming trials do not center on his foreign business deals.

purchase of a .38-caliber Colt Cobra revolver in 2018 when he was addicted to drugs.\n\nHe will go on trial in the family's home town of Wilmington, Delaware, on two counts of making false statements

Each count carries a maximum fine of $250,000 and three years of supervised release.\n\nThe trial begins nearly a year after presiding Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned a plea deal between prosecutors and Hunter Biden, which subsequently fell apart.\n\nThe agreement, blasted as a \"sweetheart\" deal by congressional Republicans, appeared to convey broad immunity to the president's son on a host of potential criminal charges.\n\nAccording to an indictment, Hunter Biden bought a Colt Cobra revolver Oct. 12, 2018, and \"knowingly made a false and fictitious written statement, intended and likely to deceive that dealer with respect to a fact material to the lawfulness of the sale of the firearm ... certifying he was not an unlawful user of, and addicted to, any stimulant, narcotic drug, and any other controlled substance, when in fact, as he knew, that statement was false and fictitious.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_possession_of_a_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Criminal possession of a weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_false_statements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Making false statements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryellen_Noreika", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maryellen Noreika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Controlled substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_Cobra", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colt Cobra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revolver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Education", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Regulatory_and_Legal", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Regulatory and Legal", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://livenews.foxnews.com/images/2024/06/b38c3c48db59f5d3ccf5b15693a264fb.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-12", "textStart": 1249, "textEnd": 1262}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The proceeding will include testimony by a former Delaware State Police official who investigated that incident, as well as the person who trashed the gun: Biden's then-lover and widow of his late brother.\n\nIt will also include testimony from workers from a gun store on U.S. 202 in Talleyville, a shop that now finds itself at the center of criticisms by Hunter Biden's defense attorneys for seemingly committing a similar paperwork infraction that led to Biden's criminal charges.\n\nIt all started with an odd incident involving Hunter Biden and Hallie Biden at Janssen's in October 2018, an incident that would escape the public eye for years.\n\nHow did Hunter Biden's gun end up in the trash?\n\nA Delaware State Police investigative report from 2018 included in court filings details the investigation into the incident, as well as interviews with Hunter Biden and Hallie Biden - the widow of Hunter Biden's brother, the late Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden. At the time of the Janssen's incident, she was Hunter Biden's lover.\n\nThe police report isn't clear on who summoned State Police to the grocery store, though it appears from the redacted copy included in court documents that it was a store employee. Police arrived and found Hallie Biden in the store's office. She told officers she took her children to school that morning and returned home and searched Hunter Biden's vehicle, locating the handgun in the center console.\n\nShe put it in a bag and later drove to Janssen's and threw the bag and the gun in the trash outside the store, she told officers. Hunter Biden had left by the time she returned and she called him to confront him about the gun. She said Hunter Biden became upset and implored her to drive back and retrieve it.\n\nBut when she returned, the gun was no longer in the trash. She got nervous and approached the store owner to confess. The officer wrote that Hallie Biden \"danced around\" questions about why she searched Hunter Biden's car and later stated she thought he was \"screwing around on me.\"\n\n\"She was kind of all over the place,\" the officer wrote.\n\nRecent: Hunter Biden trial begins Monday in Wilmington: What you need to know about the case\n\nIn the presence of the officers, she then called Hunter Biden and told him the officer wished to speak to him. He arrived half an hour later.\n\nHe told the officer he was in a relationship with Hallie Biden, sometimes stayed at her home nearby but still lived in Washington D.C. He claimed he woke up at her home that morning and began to drive to Washington D.C. when he noticed the gun was missing and he called Hallie Biden, who admitted to tossing the gun in the trash.\n\nHe said he purchased it for target practice but had not shot it. The officer wrote that he told Hunter Biden that Hallie Biden was not very forthcoming and asked him if the gun had been used in a crime.\n\n\"He became very agitated with me and asked if I was intentionally trying to make him mad,\" the officer wrote.\n\nBiden also asked whether he should call an attorney. The officer emphasized that his interest was simply in locating the gun to protect children, as A.I. du Pont High School is right across the street.\n\nAttention then focused on who might have retrieved the gun from the trash.\n\nHunter Biden told him Hallie Biden had mentioned noticing a \"homeless man\" collecting cans and speculated he may have the gun. Employees of the store and officers said they had also noticed the man in the past.\n\nThe officer wrote that two \"Mexican males\" then passed them wearing Janssen's Market shirts and Hunter Biden stated \"they have some shady people working at the market\" and referred to the men as \"prolly illegal.\"\n\nThe officer later asked if he had told his father about this. Hunter Biden said, \"I have never called my dad for anything.\" He also speculated that Hallie Biden searched his car because she was worried he might harm himself.\n\nEventually, officers would focus on finding the man known for plundering the grocery store's garbage.\n\nHow did officers find Hunter Biden's gun?\n\nAbout a week later, officers were able to locate the man with the help of a worker at another local store that the man frequented. They watched as he spent about an hour rummaging through trash receptacles in the Greenville Crossing Shopping Center and approached as he loaded the loot into the back of his car.\n\nHe told them he routinely collects recyclables to trade for cash when he goes to New York. Conversation then turned to someone putting something in the trash that shouldn't have been there recently.\n\n\"Yes, they did,\" the man responded. \"A .38 special.\"\n\nRecent: What is an 'addict'? Hunter Biden is fighting what that means as gun trial looms\n\nHe then took officers back to his home where he had stashed the gun in a sock inside a box. The officer wrote that the man could not provide a reason why he didn't report the gun to police, but told them he would alert authorities if he ever came across another in the trash.\n\nHe also gave officers another gun that he said his co-worker had given him many years ago with the understanding that it belonged to his co-worker's brother, \"who was in some kind of trouble and needed to get rid of the gun,\" according to the police report.\n\nThe officer called Hunter Biden to report the gun's recovery and wrote that Hunter Biden was firm that there should be no prosecution in the case.\n\n\"The whole thing is just stupid,\" the officer quotes Hunter Biden saying.\n\nProsecutors in the Delaware Department of Justice were consulted and decided the case didn't warrant any sort of criminal prosecution, according to the police report.\n\nIn addition to testimony from Hallie Biden, Millard Greer, a former state police officer who authored the final investigative report on the incident included in court files, is expected to testify. He has since taken a job as an investigator in the Delaware Department of Justice unit tasked with policing public corruption.\n\nWere the Secret Service involved?\n\nThis incident was first reported by the conservative news website The Blaze in 2020. Their report was built on anonymous law enforcement sources.\n\nPolitico followed up on the story with a leaked copy of the Delaware State Police report, a document typically kept secret by state officials and shielded by Delaware's restrictive public records law. The Politico story focused on a curious ripple: both state police investigators, as well as the Secret Service, had contacted the Delaware gun shop about the paperwork Hunter Biden filled out in purchasing the gun.\n\nThis was odd because Joe Biden was in between his term as Vice President and becoming the Democratic nominee for president, so he and his family were not under Secret Service protection, Politico reported.\n\nIn a recent interview with federal authorities, the owner of the gun shop reiterated that both State Police and the Secret Service separately contacted him shortly after Hunter Biden's gun had gone missing. He said they seemed to not be aware of the other's investigation. In the interview, the owner said the request from the Secret Service \"didn't feel right\" so he only gave the form to State Police investigators at the time.\n\nWhy is the Brandywine Hundred gun store StarQuest Shooters involved?\n\nWhile the trash can incident explains how the gun purchase came to the attention of federal investigators, it was the actual purchase that has Hunter Biden facing the potential of decades in prison.\n\nThe gun, a Colt .38 special revolver, was purchased from StarQuest Shooters & Survival Supply store on Concord Pike in October 2018, a few weeks before the Janssen's incident.\n\nThe store is owned by Ron Palimere, who through the years has been quoted in Delaware Online/The News Journal about gun safety laws and doomsday prep. Attempts to reach him through the store and his email were unsuccessful.\n\nProsecutors intend to call another employee of the store, Gordon Cleveland, to testify about the transaction with Hunter Biden. Cleveland is expected to testify that he watched Hunter Biden fill out what is known as ATF form 4473. On it, prosecutors contend that Hunter Biden stated that he was not an unlawful user of or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nProsecutors contend that statement is false and it is the foundation of two of the criminal charges against Hunter Biden.\n\nMeanwhile, Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden's primary defense attorney, last week signaled his intent to call Palimere to the stand to discuss differences between a copy of the ATF form emailed to federal authorities shortly after the purchase and the original that federal officials took possession of three years later.\n\nThe original that federal officials took possession of more recently had additions including \"DE Vehicle Registration\" written into a box for supplemental government-issued documentation. There were no alleged changes to the specific portion that Hunter Biden filled out.\n\nWhy was the form edited?\n\nLowell noted the \"doctored\" form in a pretrial hearing earlier this month, prompting prosecutors and FBI agents to interview Palimere and include a transcript in court filings seeking to keep what they describe as the \"annotated\" form out of evidence.\n\nPalimere told agents that he also owned a consignment store next door and believed he was called from there to the gun shop when employees recognized Biden as a \"celebrity-type customer.\"\n\nHe remained in the back of the store and the salesman said Biden wanted to use his passport for identification, not a driver's license, which is typical. Passports don't typically contain a person's home address, but Palmiere blessed the use of the passport, according to the interview report.\n\n\"Palimere was familiar with Biden's father's not being a gun supporter so Palimere thought it would be bad for Palimere's business to have Hunter Biden seen in his store,\" the report states. \"Palimere wanted to get the sale completed and get Biden out of the store.\"\n\nHe added that the fact that the \"Biden family home was so well known\" and his lack of knowledge about the details of a passport caused him to have incomplete information on the form. He didn't handle the form for three years until a federal agent requested the original be turned over.\n\nAfter he was contacted, he reviewed the form and another employee brought up that it needed to be annotated.\n\n\"Palimere decided to write Delaware registration in the box,\" the interview summation states. \"Palimere does not know why that was chosen but he knew it had to be an official document and it was all they could think of.\"\n\nIt adds that Palimere told authorities he doesn't think that Hunter Biden actually showed his vehicle registration the day he bought the gun. The interview report notes that federal authorities allow for forms to be annotated after the fact, which would typically involve calling the customer and having them show documents regarding their residency.\n\n\"Palimere was not about to call Biden. Palimere felt they could not have him come into the store,\" the report states. \"Plus, Palimere did not want to contact Biden and tell him he needed to come in and he was being investigated.\"\n\nLowell has sought to make the annotation a feature of Hunter Biden's defense.\n\nIn arguing for the edited form to be admitted, he said it speaks to the credibility of those testifying that Hunter Biden filled out the form and is also relevant to explore any benefit the witnesses received by prosecutors disregarding potentially incorrect information they put on the form.\n\nIn arguing to keep the edited form out of evidence, prosecutors argued it would confuse the jury and changes to the form after the fact are not relevant.\n\nAs of Friday, Presiding Judge Maryellen Norieka had not ruled whether the annotated form will be allowed into evidence.", "source": {"uri": "delawareonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News Journal"}, "authors": [],

This comes on the heels of former President Donald Trump's recent felony conviction for ...wait for it, \"Falsifying Records,\" thrusting the courtroom into the spotlight during a heated presidential election year.\n\nThe charges against Hunter stem from a 2018 firearms purchase. Prosecutors allege that he lied on a federal form about his drug use at the time, a serious offense that could potentially land him in prison for up to 25 years. However, it's worth noting that first-time, nonviolent offenders rarely receive maximum sentences for such charges. Legal experts suggest that Hunter might be looking at mandatory enrollment in a firearms diversion program instead of significant prison time.\n\nThe context of this trial is especially significant. The plea deal that once shielded Hunter from severe penalties fell apart last July, much to the satisfaction of Trump's congressional allies. They've been vocal in drawing parallels between Hunter's legal woes and those of their own party's presidential candidate, casting both men as political targets.\n\nThe case is not just a legal battle for Hunter but a satisfying personal and political ordeal for President Biden. The prosecution, led by special counsel David Weiss, plans to air some of the Biden family's most private moments, including testimonies from Hunter's ex-wife and Hunter's dead brother's former partner, Hallie Biden.\n\nThis trial's timing couldn't be more challenging for President Biden. Just days after Trump's conviction, which raised Trump over $200,000,000, the spotlight shifted to Biden's son, potentially overshadowing Trump's legal troubles. For the Biden campaign, this trial is a significant distraction, complicating efforts to capitalize on the recent conviction of the former President.\n\nHunter Biden's legal troubles don't end here. He faces a second trial in September on tax-related charges, further entangling the Biden family in courtroom dramas during a crucial election year. Despite these challenges, Hunter's father remains steadfast in his support for the \"smartest man I know...\" In a statement, President Biden expressed his pride in his son's resilience and strength in overcoming addiction; there was no mention of the cocaine found recently at the White House.\n\nAs the trial unfolds, it underscores the heightened scrutiny on the Biden family and the intense political climate leading up to the election. For many, the spectacle of this trial highlights the irony and hypocrisy of President Biden's tough stance on drugs and guns, given that his own son is on trial for drug use while buying a gun. We hope for a fair trial and that Hunter does not get a pass simply because he is the President's son.", "source": {"uri": "ammoland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AmmoLand.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "f_riehl@ammoland.com", "name": "F Riehl", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversion_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diversion program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show_Jumping", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show Jumping", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.ammoland.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/axeivskcx5u.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

According to the prosecution, he purchased it unlawfully in October 2018 after making a fraudulent statement on a federal form claiming he did not use drugs. His lawyers claim that he never discharged the pistol, and it was eventually thrown in a garbage can.\n\nAlthough the trial is unrelated to Hunter Biden's business dealings, which have been the focus of a lengthy federal investigation and a fruitless Republican impeachment investigation into his father, U.S. President Joe Biden, it is anticipated to include intensely private and embarrassing testimony regarding a difficult period in the younger Biden's life. Additionally, it is likely to provide Donald Trump's supporters fresh political momentum as they want to divert attention away from the presumed Republican presidential nominee's own legal issues following his conviction on 34 felony counts related to hush money.\n\nThe matter arose during a time when Hunter Biden was addicted to crack, as he himself admitted to. In his memoir \"Beautiful Things,\" he talked about how, following the death of his elder brother Beau at the age of 46 from brain cancer, he became engrossed in drugs and alcohol. Prosecutors argued that he was aware of his drug addiction even though he claimed not to have one on the paperwork required to purchase a firearm. Text messages, images, and videos of Hunter Biden using crack will be likely shown to the jury, in an attempt to also indirectly discredit his father and presumptive Democratic nominee for the November presidential election.\n\nIn the meantime, Hunter and his father Joe were photographed on Saturday afternoon at a church in Delaware and later riding a bicycle. They had gathered earlier in the week to commemorate the passing of Beau, the president's eldest son, who passed away on May 30, 2015.", "source": {"uri": "lavocedinewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "La Voce di New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_Cobra", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt Cobra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.38_Special", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": ".38 Special"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_inquiry_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment inquiry in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pistol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brain tumor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual_Addiction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual Addiction", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://lavocedinewyork.com/wp-content/uploads/ansa/2023/10/03/a146461a308563e655d4f4bff40e4cf0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-05-30", "textStart": 2223, "textEnd": 2235}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-", "textStart": 492, "textEnd": 504}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Melissa was at her husband's side, holding his hand.\n\nMonday also marks Jill Biden's 73rd birthday. She walked into the courthouse wearing a purple theory pantsuit and carrying an $1,800 Ralph Lauren handbag. Peter Neal, Naomi's husband and her grandson-in-law, walked at the first lady's side.\n\nInside the courtroom, Hunter Biden greeted his mother with a bit of a joke as they waited for the trial to being.\n\n'Happy Birthday,' he said. 'I got you to a special event.'\n\nThe duo laughed.\n\nJill Biden walks into the courthouse with grandson-in-law Peter Neal (right) and longtime aide Anthony Bernal (left)\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Jill Biden changed their schedule to be in Wilmington for the morning of Hunter's trial, where he faces charge on three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase.\n\nThey left their Rehoboth beach house on Sunday night when they were originally scheduled to leave Monday. They spent the night in their Wilmington home. Hunter is believed to be staying there with them.\n\nThe Biden family is tight, having bonded through multiple tragedies - the death of Hunter's mom Neilia in a car crash when he and Beau were young children, Beau's death in 2015 from cancer and Hunter's years-long struggle with addiction.\n\nThe president put out a statement on Monday morning in support of his son.\n\n'I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us,' he said.\n\n'A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean. As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength. Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.'\n\nThe president kept his son close this weekend. The two were bicycle ride and at church on Saturday afternoon in Rehoboth Beach, Del.\n\nThe first lady has spoken of her belief in Hunter's innocence.\n\n'I think what they are doing to Hunter is cruel,' Jill Biden told MSNBC in November. 'I'm really proud of how Hunter has rebuilt his life after addiction. I love my son.'\n\nJill Biden considers her stepson a son. Hunter was seven when she married Joe in 1977. She has often spoke about how she rejected Joe's proposal multiple times because she wanted to be sure the marriage would be stable for Beau and Hunter.\n\n'I had to make absolutely sure that this marriage was going to work because [the brothers] had lost their mother and they had lost their sister. I knew that it had to work because they had lost so much. They had to feel secure that this marriage would work,' she has said.\n\nHunter Biden walks into the courthouse with wife Melissa Cohen\n\nAshley Biden arrives at the courthouse\n\nHunter faces charges that he lied about his drug use on a form he filled out to purchase a handgun in 2018. In his memoir he writes about how Beau's death retrigged his addiction.\n\nAt the time of the gun purchase, he was separated from his first wife Kathleen and dating Hallie Biden, Beau's widow.\n\nHe has said the two bonded through their grief.\n\nHallie was the one who found the gun and threw it in the trash can of a grocery store.\n\nBoth she and Kathleen are expected to testify.\n\nHunter has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department. He originally had a plea deal that promised some immunity and no prison time but it collapsed last year in face of Republican criticism that the president's son was getting a sweetheart deal.\n\nIf he were to be convicted, he could face fines up to $750,000 and up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nMonday starts with jury selection, a process that is expected to last around three days.\n\nHunter and Kathleen have three daughters from their marriage - Naomi, Finnegan and Maisy. None of the three girls were seen at the courthouse.\n\nHunter married Melissa Cohen in May 2019 after knowing her only for six days. They have a son, four-year-old Beau.\n\nHunter faces a second trial September on charges he failed to pay taxes from a time when he was using drugs and alcohol heavily and spending lavishly. He has since paid his back taxes.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Family of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Cohen_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Cohen Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ashley Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Lauren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neilia_Hunter_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neilia Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Traffic collision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehoboth_Beach,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rehoboth Beach, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rehoboth Beach, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show_Jumping", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show Jumping", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/03/14/85650579-0-image-m-14_1717423058479.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-05-", "textStart": 4587, "textEnd": 4595}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, Trump has etched his name in history as the first ex-president convicted of felony charges, with a New York jury declaring him guilty on all 34 counts related to a scheme aimed at swaying the 2016 election via a hush money pact with adult film star Stormy Daniels, who alleges a past sexual liaison with him.\n\nGrant Reeher, director of the Campbell Public Affairs Institute and a professor of political science at Syracuse University, shared his insights on how the Biden camp might capitalize on Trump's legal woes. Speaking to the Mirror, Reeher said: \"I think Biden will let the surrogates crow about this.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Joe Biden shades Donald Trump as he flashes cheeky smile after he's asked about felon's conviction\n\nREAD MORE: Joe Biden's son Beau had six heartbreaking words for dad in final moments before death\n\nHunter Biden, son of U.S. President Joe Biden, departs a House Oversight Committee meeting at Capitol Hill on January 10, 2024 ( Image: Getty Images)\n\nHe elaborated on Biden's approach: \"His strategy has been to try to appear more presidential in contrast, so to draw special attention to it on his own will only bring up his son, his garage, etc., again. And it's really not clear what the overall impact of this verdict will be.\"\n\nReeher also pondered the repercussions for Trump: \"One would think it would have to hurt Trump somehow, among the small number of true independents. But have we really learned anything new? And I'm sure it will be appealed.\"\n\nHunter Biden's business activities have been the center of a lengthy federal investigation and an unsuccessful impeachment inquiry by Republicans into the Democratic president. Despite the intense scrutiny on his business transactions, Hunter is preparing for a trial on federal gun charges brought by his father's Justice Department.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden originates from a time when he publicly admitted to being addicted to crack cocaine. His spiral into drug and alcohol abuse followed the death of his brother Beau Biden from cancer in 2015.\n\nJoin the Mirror's SMS news service to get the biggest breaking stories delivered straight to your phone.

A trial is scheduled to start on June 3 and could last up to two weeks, coinciding with his father's re-election campaign.\n\nWhile Hunter has admitted to a crack cocaine addiction during that time, his legal team maintains that he did not violate any laws and that the case is politically driven. A report from a special counsel released in February found evidence that President Biden knowingly retained and disclosed highly classified information while he was a private citizen, including details about military and foreign policy in Afghanistan.\n\nHowever, it concluded that criminal charges were not justified. The report from Special Counsel Robert Hur puts an end to a criminal investigation that had loomed over Biden's presidency. However, its harsh critique of his handling of sensitive government documents and unflattering revelations about his memory continue to fuel ongoing criticism of Biden.\n\nTrump has been found guilty in court ( Image: Getty Images)\n\nBiden retaliated, denying any improper sharing of classified information and expressing his anger at Hur for questioning his mental sharpness, especially his memory of the timing of his late son Beau's death from cancer.\n\nRepublicans have used Hunter Biden as a means to target the President. Trump's team was accused of pressuring Ukrainian officials to investigate Hunter for corruption in the war-ravaged country.\n\nA Ukrainian official, later revealed to be a Russian agent, met with Trump's former attorney Rudy Giuliani in Ukraine in 2019 in an attempt to connect Hunter to corruption. The agent appeared alongside Giuliani on conservative US media outlets before the 2020 election, where they disclosed details of their supposed investigation.", "source": {"uri": "themirror.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mirror US"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beau Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes.

Trump became the first former American president to be convicted of felony crimes Thursday as a New York jury found him guilty of all 34 charges in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to adult actress Stormy Daniels, who has claimed the two had a sexual encounter.\n\nGrant Reeher, director of the Campbell Public Affairs Institute and a professor of political science at Syracuse University, gave his predictions about how the Biden camp will monopolise on Trump's conviction. He told the Mirror: \"I think Biden will let the surrogates crow about this.\n\nREAD MORE: Face-to-face with Stormy Daniels - the unlikely ex-porn star who changed world for better\n\n\"His strategy has been to try to appear more presidential in contrast, so to draw special attention to it on his own will only bring up his son, his garage, etc., again. And it's really not clear what the overall impact of this verdict will be.\n\n\"One would think it would have to hurt Trump somehow, among the small number of true independents. But have we really learned anything new? And I'm sure it will be appealed.\"\n\nHunter Biden's business dealings have been the focus of the yearslong federal investigation and Republicans' fruitless impeachment inquiry into the Democratic president. Despite the scrutiny on his business dealings, Hunter is heading to trial on federal gun charges in a case brought by his dad's Justice Department.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period where, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack cocaine. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother Beau Biden from cancer.\n\nHunter is charged with lying about his drug use in October 2018 on a form to buy a gun that he kept for about 11 days in Delaware. A trial is set to begin June 3 and could last up to two weeks as his dad's re-election campaign unfolds.\n\nHunter has acknowledged an addiction to crack cocaine during that period, but his lawyers have said he didn't break the law and the case is politically motivated.\n\nA special counsel report released in February found evidence that President Biden willfully kept and shared highly classified information when he was a private citizen, including about military and foreign policy in Afghanistan, but concluded that criminal charges were not warranted.\n\nThe report from Special Counsel Robert Hur resolves a criminal investigation that had shadowed Biden's presidency. But its scathing assessment of his handling of sensitive government records and unflattering revelations about his memory fed ongoing criticism of Biden.\n\nBiden hit back, denying that he improperly shared classified information and angrily lashed out at Hur for questioning his mental acuity, particularly his recollection of the timing of his late son Beau's death from cancer.

Allegedly, he lied on a federal form about his drug use when purchased a revolver back in 2018. The trial begins the week after the guilty verdicts in Donald Trump's New York trial by a biased jury presided over by a biased judge in a case brought by a biased prosecutor.\n\nWhile legal experts on both sides of the aisle have argued that the case against Trump was rigged against him, some on the left have pointed to the case against Hunter Biden as proof that our justice system isn't biased at all and that the two-tiered justice system that Trump complains about doesn't exist. However, Biden's legal troubles are proof that the two-tiered justice system is alive and well.\n\nRemember, this trial almost didn't take place because prosecutors in the Biden Justice Department negotiated a plea deal for Hunter Biden that would have effectively given him a clean slate. The plea deal would have given Biden blanket immunity as part of the pretrial diversion agreement. Under the deal, he wouldn't have gotten any jail time and wouldn't face justice for a multitude of crimes he'd allegedly committed, including violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\n\nHunter Biden was accused of crimes involving using and distributing illicit drugs while illegally possessing a firearm, which would typically warrant felony charges and a prison sentence of up to ten years with a mandatory minimum of five. The pretrial diversion agreement would have erased the gun charge and treated his tax crimes as misdemeanors rather than felonies.\n\nBiden's legal team knew how to maneuver to get what they wanted and even leveraged Joe Biden to get the deal made. According to reports, the DOJ prosecutors who investigated Hunter Biden for five years greeted him like an old friend in court.\n\nHad it not been for Judge Maryellen Noreika laughing at the absurd plea deal, Biden would have pleaded guilty and avoided any accountability for his crimes. We should also give credit to the whistleblowers who came forward to expose how the Biden Justice Department was interfering on Hunter Biden's behalf or else the deal may have survived.\n\nFor our VIPs: Joe Biden Trusts A Justice System That Has Protected Him and His Family\n\nWhistleblower testimony also revealed that political interference allowed the statute of limitations to expire on tax charges related to Biden's 2014 and 2015 tax returns, which reportedly included Foreign Agents Registration Act violations. In New York, DA Alvin Bragg took an expired misdemeanor charge (for a non-crime) and bootstrapped it into a felony to bring multiple charges against Trump for one alleged crime.\n\nAnother problem is that Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed David Weiss, one of the architects of the sweetheart plea deal that would have let Hunter off scot-free, as special counsel in the case.\n\nIt's a small miracle that Biden was indicted at all and that we've gone to trial. But is Weiss going to put forth the best case against Biden after originally trying to get him off the hook?", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_margolis@pjmedia.com", "name": "Matt Margolis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_possession_of_a_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal possession of a weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Agents_Registration_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Agents Registration Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legal immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_sentencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mandatory sentencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statute of limitations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/11/74c5628e-2082-42f6-9d99-0006853822f5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Taken together, these decisions could make a tough case for Hunter Biden even more challenging to win. President Joe Biden's son has pleaded not guilty to illegally buying and owning a gun while abusing illicit drugs.\n\nNoreika granted a request from special counsel David Weiss to block one of Hunter Biden's expert witnesses from testifying. The defense had lined up a Columbia University-based psychiatrist who would've tried to poke holes in prosecutors' assertions that Hunter Biden knew he was an addict in 2018 when he bought the gun that led to his indictment.\n\n\"The inadequacy of Defendant's expert disclosure for Dr. (Elie) Aoun leaves the government in the dark as to what his opinions about the facts of this case will be, thus rendering the government unable to prepare for trial,\" Noreika wrote in her ruling.\n\nThe judge also blocked Hunter Biden's lawyers from using what they thought was a key piece of exculpatory evidence: an altered version of the federal firearms form he filled out when he bought the gun in 2018 that was tweaked in 2021 by the gun store employees.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers recently argued in court that they wanted to use the doctored form to undermine the credibility of the employees, who are slated to testify on behalf of the prosecutors. They also claimed it showed prosecutors were politically \"biased.\"\n\nBut Noreika ruled the altered version of the form was \"irrelevant and inadmissible,\" and she went on to blast Hunter Biden's team for pushing \"conspiratorial\" theories and \"unsupported rhetoric\" about the motivations of the Wilmington gun store employees.\n\n\"Any probative value it arguably has is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, and misleading the jury,\" she wrote, further adding that any attempts by the defense to use the altered form to demonstrate the employees' alleged political bias would have been \"unduly prejudicial and invites (jury) nullification.\"\n\nOnly the original form - known as ATF Form 4473 - will be shown to the jury.\n\nOn that form, Hunter Biden is accused of falsely swearing that he wasn't using or addicted to drugs, which allowed him to purchase the gun.

Attorney David Weiss, who was designated as special counsel to oversee the Hunter Biden investigations last year, filed the charge on behalf of the Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden, 54, is accused of violating federal law by purchasing and possessing a firearm while abusing or addicted to drugs. Although he has been transparent about his battles with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction, he entered a not-guilty plea to the three counts.\n\nThe first two allegations in the three-count indictment are related to the firearms purchase itself. When purchasing a firearm, a person is required to confirm on a form provided by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that they are legally allowed to buy the weapon. Hunter Biden has been accused of lying on those forms.\n\nCount 3 deals with firearms possession. Possessing a firearm while consuming drugs is likewise illegal under federal law. According to the indictment and interaction made public in recent court files, Hunter Biden owned the pistol for eleven days in October 2018 before his girlfriend discarded it in the garbage because she was concerned about his mental state.\n\nThe president's son could spend up to 25 years in jail if he is found guilty on all three counts. However, he has no past criminal record, and first-time offenders frequently receive terms substantially shorter than the maximum. Noreika would be completely responsible for his sentence.\n\nAlso read: Mass shooting in US leaves 1 dead, 27 injured; investigation underway\n\nGiven that these are federal accusations, Joe Biden has the authority to pardon his son at any moment. If his son is convicted, the president can commute his sentence, allowing him to avoid the punishment.\n\nThe White House has publicly ruled out the idea of a pardon, but the political equations may shift after the November election.\n\nThis is only one of two trials that Hunter Biden will undergo this year. The second lawsuit, which centered around Hunter Biden's financial troubles, is set to begin in September in Los Angeles. He has pled not guilty to tax evasion, submitting fake tax returns, and failing to submit his taxes on time.", "source": {"uri": "wionews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WION"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crack cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pistol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco,_Firearms_and_Explosives", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutation_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commutation (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mass shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pardon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Education", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Regulatory_and_Legal", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Regulatory and Legal", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/2023/12/08/397909-succession-2023-12-08t071823057.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-", "textStart": 1409, "textEnd": 1421}], "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

They were brought forward after an investigation led by Department of Justice Special Counsel David Weiss, the U.S. Attorney for Delaware, who was appointed by Trump.\n\nPer the indictment, Hunter purchased a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver from a federally licensed firearms dealer on October 12, 2018, and allegedly lied when he filled out the Firearm Transaction Record that was legally required to purchase the gun.\n\nA press release from the U.S. Department of Justice details that count one alleges he \"knowingly made a false written statement on the Form 4473\" with the intention of deceiving the dealer he purchased the firearm from, specifically when he \"certified that he was not an unlawful user of, or addicted to, any stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.\"\n\nCount two alleges that he \"knowingly made a false statement and representation to a federally licensed firearms dealer,\" and count three alleges he \"possessed a firearm while knowing he was an unlawful user of or addicted to any stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance,\" a violation of federal law.\n\nMORE: Joe Biden shares personal message to King Charles amid cancer diagnosis\n\nMORE: White House, SAG-AFTRA respond as Taylor Swift 'considers legal action' over sexually explicit AI images\n\nThough Hunter, who went to Georgetown University for his undergraduate studies and graduated from Yale Law School in 1996, has pleaded not guilty, he has opened up about his struggles with addiction. At the time of the purchase, he had recently completed an 11-day stay in rehab, and therefore claims that when asked on the form whether he was an active drug user, he answered truthfully when he said he was not.\n\nWhat are the potential penalties?\n\nHunter faces a maximum punishment of 25 years in prison if convicted on all three counts, however, as he is a first-time offender, it would be rare for that to happen.\n\nLying on a Firearms Transaction Record is a felony, and that charge comes with a sentence of up to 10 years, while purchasing a revolver while using illicit substances has a maximum prison sentence of up to five years.\n\nMORE: King Charles hosts US President Joe Biden for tea at Windsor Castle\n\nLike with Trump's conviction, it is up to the judge, in this case U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, to decide on what the sentence would be should Hunter be convicted by the jury of 12 Delaware residents.\n\nWhat has President Biden said about his son?\n\nBiden has stood by his son's side throughout his many years of addiction struggles. He arrived in Delaware -- where he grew up and his family's home base aside from D.C. -- ahead of the trial's Monday start, and per CNN, said in a statement: \"I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nMORE: Lady Gaga joins these A-listers in new White House role appointed by President Joe Biden - fans react\n\nHe continued: \"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\" noting: \"As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength. Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\"", "source": {"uri": "hellomagazine.com", "dataType":

Trump's conviction, Hunter Biden's trial, and Mike Lynch's fraud case dominate headlines, reflecting a year of unprecedented legal and political drama in the US.\n\nFollowing is a summary of current US domestic news briefs.\n\nTrump warns of 'breaking point' for Americans if he's jailed\n\nDonald Trump said on Sunday he would accept home confinement or jail time after his historic conviction on criminal charges by a New York jury last week but that it would be tough for the public to accept. Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on July 11, four days before Republicans gather to formally choose their presidential nominee to face Democratic President Joe Biden in November's election.\n\nAnalysis-After trial, investors weigh Trump 2.0 factor as election looms\n\nDonald Trump last week became the first former president convicted of a felony, but Wall Street believes he still has a solid chance of winning the November election and is gaming out how a second term for the Republican candidate could impact markets. Investors said a Trump victory could broadly boost the stock market and buoy the dollar. But his proposed tariffs and extended tax cuts could also stoke inflation and hurt U.S. government bonds, they said.\n\nUS criminal trial of British tech founder Mike Lynch to wrap up\n\nJurors at the trial of British tech pioneer Mike Lynch are expected to hear closing arguments in San Francisco on Monday in the fraud case related to Hewlett-Packard's $11 billion acquisition of his software company Autonomy in 2011. The Cambridge University-educated entrepreneur took the stand in his own defense at the trial, denying wrongdoing and telling jurors that HP botched the two companies' integration.\n\nHunter Biden arrives at court as criminal trial begins in aftermath of Trump conviction\n\nThe criminal trial of Hunter Biden kicks off on Monday in federal court in Delaware as President Joe Biden's son faces gun charges in a historic case that begins four days after Donald Trump became the first former U.S. president to be convicted. Hunter Biden, 54, arrived at the courthouse for the first trial of the child of a sitting president, in which he will face three felony charges stemming from his purchase and possession of a revolver in 2018. He has pleaded not guilty. It is one of two criminal cases he faces, with federal tax charges brought separately in California.\n\nExplainer-What are the criminal charges and likely defense in Hunter Biden's gun trial?\n\nHunter Biden, the son of U.S. President Joe Biden, is scheduled to go on trial on June 3 in Delaware on charges he violated federal gun laws in 2018 when he purchased a firearm. Below is a look at the charges, evidence and potential sentence if he is found guilty. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty.\n\nCharges dropped against Minnesota state trooper who killed Black motorist\n\nProsecutors in Minnesota on Sunday dismissed charges against a state trooper accused of unintentional murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of Black motorist Ricky Cobb II last year, citing new evidence that weakened their case. The Hennepin County Attorney's Office said prosecutors were not exonerating State Trooper Ryan Londregan, only that they no longer believed they could meet their burden of proof at trial.\n\nPivotal moments leading up to the trial of Joe Biden's son Hunter\n\nHunter Biden is going on trial Monday over criminal gun-related charges. Below is a look at the key moments leading up to the trial, the first for a child of a sitting president. May 13, 2014: Burisma Group, a private energy company in Ukraine, said Hunter Biden would be joining its board. Joe Biden is vice president and oversees Ukraine policy for the administration of President Barack Obama. Burisma's founder was the subject of a series of criminal investigations by Ukrainian authorities, which would be closed in 2017 after company and founder made payments to authorities.\n\nTrump is a convicted felon. Now what?\n\nDonald Trump, the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime, will remain a free man while he awaits sentencing and could avoid a prison term entirely for falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star. Here is a look at what's next for the Republican candidate for president against Democratic President Joe Biden in a Nov. 5 election.\n\nTrump's appeal of hush money verdict to focus on Stormy Daniels testimony\n\nFormer President Donald Trump vows to appeal his historic conviction, with the focus likely on porn star Stormy Daniels' salacious testimony about their alleged sexual encounter as well as the novel legal theory that prosecutors used in the case. \"We're going to be appealing this scam,\" Trump, the 2024 Republican candidate for president, said on Friday. He faces an uphill fight.\n\nTrump conviction vindicates prosecutor Alvin Bragg's bet\n\nJust over a year after taking office as Manhattan District Attorney, Alvin Bragg took a career-defining gamble: charging a former U.S. president with crimes using an untested legal theory. The roll of the dice paid off on Thursday, when a jury found Donald Trump guilty on all 34 counts he faced of falsifying records to cover up hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels - a monumental verdict that could upend the presidential election, in which Trump is the Republican candidate.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated

Those would later be displayed in the House of Representatives by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.\n\n\"I'm... an alcoholic and a drug addict,\" Hunter Biden says in the prologue to his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" written following four years of extreme drug abuse. Writing in USA TODAY last December, Biden, 54, decried the \"weaponization of my addiction by partisan and craven factions.\"\n\nToday, Biden refers to himself as an addict in recovery. But there was a moment in 2018 when Hunter Biden was not an addict, his lawyers say. It was on Oct. 12, when Biden purchased a Colt .38 Special revolver and checked \"No\" on a federal gun form that asked: \"Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?\"\n\nOn Monday, the president's son goes on trial at a federal courthouse in Wilmington over charges he lied on that paperwork. Hunter Biden faces a maximum sentence of 25 years if convicted. The case will hinge in part on whether Biden was legally addicted when he bought the gun - and which definition of the term might prevail with the judge and jury.\n\nMore: Hunter Biden: I fought to get sober. Political weaponization of my addiction hurts more than me.\n\nSubstance abuse professionals - and the law itself - appear split over whether Biden was indeed an addict when he bought that revolver in 2018 and over the evolving meaning of addiction.\n\nThe trial comes as, once again, the younger Biden, who has never held elected or public office, finds himself at the center of a momentous presidential campaign and as a monthslong Republican move to impeach President Joe Biden has fizzled in the House.\n\nIn the fall of 2018, Hunter Biden moved back to the East Coast after months of despairing drug abuse in California. At one point that summer, his uncle, James Biden, had hauled him out of a hotel room and placed him in a rehab center before he moved in with a sobriety coach in the hills over Los Angeles.\n\n\"It was great -- the beauty, the peace, the support -- right up until the moment I relapsed,\" he writes in \"Beautiful Things. \"My lesson after a spring and summer of nonstop debauchery: no lesson at all.\"\n\nBut it was during one of those periods of sobriety that Hunter Biden purchased the handgun and answered honestly on the federal paperwork, his lawyers say.\n\n\"At issue here is Mr. Biden's understanding of the question,\" his lawyer Abbe Lowell recently wrote the court. \"Someone like Mr. Biden, who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\"\n\nBiden's lawyers haven't specified where and when the 11-day rehab took place, but they are emphatic that Biden could have reasonably considered himself sober as a result of it.\n\nSome addiction experts aren't so sure.\n\n\"Eleven days is a treatment experience. It's not a treatment success,\" said Kevin McEneaney, a former top official at Phoenix House, speaking from 30 years of working with people with substance use disorders. \"It may technically be great for court,\" he added. \"It's not accurate in the world of addiction treatment.\"\n\n\"If he was clean 11 days, I would still be coaching him, 'Hey, you've got a serious condition for the rest of your life.'\" McEneaney said. \"I wouldn't consider him away from his addiction.\"\n\n\"You could argue you are not currently dependent on any substance,\" Maia Szalavitz, the author of several books on addiction, said of Biden's stance. \"I would not consider that honest at that stage. The problem is that the legal concept of addiction is ancient.\"\n\nIs addiction in the eye of the beholder?\n\n\"There used to be a belief, 'Once an addict, always an addict,' \" said Peter Provet, CEO of Odyssey House, a New York drug treatment center. \"It's an old-school belief: Once you had that thing, it was always going to be there, that addictive vulnerability. That point of view may not always be correct.\"\n\nMore: Hunter Biden sues Rudy Giuliani over 'total annihilation' of privacy from release of laptop data\n\nAnd the stigma of addiction remains even in sobriety, with discrimination in employment, professional licensing and socially. \"I stopped using drugs at 18 but I've been labeled an addict for the rest of my life,\" McEneaney said.\n\nMore: FBI informant indicted for lying about Joe and Hunter Biden alleged business dealings\n\nIf the professionals aren't fully in agreement on when and for how long a person remains an \"addict,\" neither is the law.\n\nBiden is charged with violating a statute that is written in the present tense. It is illegal for anyone \"who is an unlawful user of or addicted\" to narcotics to possess a gun.\n\nBut federal prosecutors want to define Biden's addiction using a much broader Treasury Department definition, which considers a person \"an unlawful current user of a controlled substance\" if there is \"a pattern of use or possession that reasonably covers the present time,\" including a failed drug test in the past year.\n\nBiden's lawyers have asked U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika to keep the damaging Treasury definition away from the jury. Noreika's proposed jury instructions, released publicly on Saturday, steer clear of defining addiction. Both sides have until Monday morning to object to her instructions.\n\nJurors are likely to see plenty of evidence of the famous defendant's use of cocaine - including some exhibits with inconvenient dates.\n\nJustice Department special counsel David Weiss has pulled volumes of evidence of Biden's drug use from both his memoir and his iCloud computer backup.\n\nThe exhibits include a message from Oct. 13, 2018 - one day after the gun buy - where Biden allegedly writes that he is \"waiting for a drug dealer named Mookie,\" and another from Oct. 14 in which he describes himself as \"sleeping on a car smoking crack.\"\n\nMore: Not a 'deadbeat dad': Mother of President Biden's seventh grandchild comes to Hunter's defense\n\nLegally, the question of Biden's sobriety may come down to his state of mind on the day he bought the pistol. His lawyers say he never loaded or used the weapon. On Oct. 23, Biden's then-girlfriend - now a prosecution witness - took the gun from his car and tossed it into a trash can outside a Delaware convenience store, where it was retrieved by a man harvesting empty cans and later by the police.\n\n\"It's impossible to get well, no matter what the therapy, unless you commit to it absolutely,\" Biden writes in \"Beautiful Things.\" \"The Alcoholics Anonymous 'Big Book' -- the substance abuse bible, written by group founder Bill Wilson -- makes that clear: 'Half measures availed us nothing.'\"\n\n\"By this point in my life,\" Biden says of those days in 2018, \"I'd written the book on half measures.\"\n\nIn the end, it wasn't Alcoholics Anonymous, or therapy with the psychoactive root ibogaine, or the psychedelic compound 5-MeO-DMT, taken from the secretions of the Sonoran Desert toad, or the antidepressant ketamine that Hunter Biden ultimately found most helpful.\n\nAfter four years in hell, Biden writes, in May 2019, he fell hard for Melissa Cohen, a South African woman with eyes that matched those of his late brother, Beau. She seized his electronics, flushed his drugs and kept at bay a coterie of toxic hangers-on.\n\nAfter years of addiction Biden says, he found sobriety - and a new wife - in seven days.\n\nAfter being hunted by Trump and his followers, his privacy destroyed by the leaking of the famous laptop's contents, Biden, now happily married, is again a public figure. Where Donald Trump once roared \"Where's Hunter?\" at 2020 reelection rallies, the president's son is often seen at his father's side and at White House events.\n\nMore: Hunter Biden denies Joe Biden involved in family business: 'Destructive political charade'\n\nMore challenges remain. In addition to the federal gun trial, Hunter Biden faces federal charges in California over failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes, which he later paid to the government. The gun and tax charges both stem from a failed plea agreement between Biden and federal prosecutors that collapsed last summer. A trial in the tax case is set to begin Sept. 5 in Los Angeles, just before Joe Biden and Trump are scheduled for a debate.\n\nHunter Biden is also in the middle of a fractious multi-million-dollar alimony case with his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, who is expected to testify for the prosecution at the gun trial.\n\nWhile Biden sometimes uses the language of the recovery moment to describe his addiction, he doesn't write about his own recovery using those terms.\n\n\"He does not see himself in the 12-step lens. He attributes his recovery to falling in love,\" Szalavitz says. \"That is a valid way of recovering.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

(Samuel Corum/Getty Images)\n\nJury selection is set to begin this week in first son Hunter Biden's federal gun crime case.\n\nThe first round of the jury selection process will begin on June 3 at the J. Caleb Boggs federal courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nMr. Biden has been at the center of a series of controversies since the campaign era of the 2020 election cycle for a series of alleged personal, business, and legal failures.\n\nNow, the first son is about to face the prospect of a trial that's sure to be highly publicized and runs the risk of years in a federal penitentiary.\n\nThe trial will focus on allegedly untruthful statements that Mr. Biden made on a form to receive a firearm in 2018.\n\nThe start of the trial represents a fresh challenge for the embattled President Joe Biden, who just days ago wrote on X, \"Nobody is above the law\" after his 2024 rival, former President Donald Trump, was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in New York.\n\nHere's what you should know as jury selection begins in the trial:\n\nMr. Biden is facing charges related to a three-count indictment brought by special counsel David Weiss, who's leading the case for the government.\n\nThe first two charges relate to the allegedly untruthful statements Mr. Biden made on a form to receive a firearm that, under the terms of U.S. law, he wasn't allowed to possess.\n\nWhen buying a firearm, people have to fill out a form through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms certifying several things before they're allowed to receive the weapon.\n\nFor instance, the form asks whether the buyer has been convicted of a felony, whether they've been dishonorably discharged, if they're a fugitive, and -- crucially to Mr. Biden's case -- whether the prospective buyer is \"addicted to, or an unlawful user of\" marijuana or any other federally scheduled drug.\n\nAccording to the first two charges in Mr. Biden's indictment, he checked \"No\" in response to this last question despite his later admission to use of crack cocaine at the time.\n\nThis alleged untruthfulness constitutes a federal felony.\n\nThe third count in the indictment is related to the actual possession of the firearm, as federal law also prohibits those abusing drugs from possessing a gun.\n\nMr. Biden reportedly possessed the gun for a total of 11 days, at which point his girlfriend, who was reportedly worried about his mental health, disposed of it.\n\nThe trial itself will feature a full cast of characters on both sides of the issue.\n\nAt the center of the trial is Mr. Biden himself.\n\nThe trial will be overseen by Trump-appointed Federal Judge Maryellen Noreika, whose rejection of a proposed plea agreement last year brought about the trial.\n\nJudge Noreika has rebuffed efforts by Mr. Biden to toss out the case, but she has also given wins to both sides on key evidentiary questions in the case.\n\nLeading the case for the government is Mr. Weiss, a Trump-appointee who has himself faced a litany of criticisms from the right for allegedly being too lenient on Mr. Biden.\n\nFederal prosecutors in the case have said they plan to call in around a dozen witnesses -- most notably, they'll have three of Mr. Biden's former romantic partners testify.\n\nThe most high-profile of these is Hallie Biden, the wife of Mr. Biden's deceased brother Beau who engaged in a relationship with Mr. Biden following her husband's death in 2015.\n\nRecently, a visit to Ms. Biden by President Biden caused a short-lived media frenzy, with many critics raising concerns about possible witness tampering or intimidation.\n\nThe case will also feature testimony from Kathleen Buhle, Mr. Biden's ex-wife, and Lunden Roberts, the mother of one of his children.\n\nAround 250 Delawareans have been summoned to be prospective jurors in the case, Ms. Noreika has said.\n\nAs the trial gets underway, that number will be whittled down to 12 jurors and some alternates.\n\nGiven the political nature of the case, a key question for these jurors will likely be based on where they get their news. The same question was key during the jury selection in President Trump's New York trial.\n\nAttorneys will need to find jurors capable of being objective in the case, whatever their feelings toward President Biden and the first family.\n\nWhile Delaware isn't nearly as much of a dark-blue stronghold as Manhattan is, the state still leans heavily toward Democrats -- a fact that could make it difficult to put together a jury willing to convict a Democrat president's son in an election year.\n\nThe case has high stakes for everyone involved.\n\nFor Mr. Biden himself, it means the difference between freedom and confinement: if convicted, Mr. Biden faces as much as 25 years in a federal penitentiary.\n\nThat said, Mr. Biden would be a first-time offender who's unlikely to face nearly that much time.\n\nStill, if he's convicted of all three charges there's a good chance he could spend months or years behind bars.\n\nThe case also could have broad political ramifications at a time that the campaign stump and the courtroom are more closely linked in politics than ever.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has said that President Biden wouldn't pardon his son if he was found guilty.\n\nBut should President Biden lose his reelection bid in November, he could find himself facing a great deal of pressure from his family to pardon his son before leaving the White House.\n\nA conviction could have a limited impact on President Biden's campaign.\n\nPolls show that most voters don't blame the alleged sins of the son on the father, but some do: That could be deadly in a race that could be decided by a tilt margin in some battleground states.\n\nFor Republicans, the case could take some of the media attention off of President Trump and put it back onto President Biden.\n\nShould Mr. Biden be acquitted, Republicans could use the acquittal to continue their claims that the judicial system has been fundamentally broken and politicized by actors within the Department of Justice.\n\nPresident Biden, for his part, has largely stood off from the case, simply telling the press that he's \"proud of his son\" and being largely supportive in his few public statements on the matter.\n\nMr. Biden is about to face a jury of his peers -- but originally, it wasn't supposed to play out like this at all.\n\nLast year, Mr. Biden appeared in the same courthouse where he'll be tried.\n\nEscorted by Secret Service agents and his high-powered legal team, Mr. Biden's first court appearance on the matter came in July 2023.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Biden was hoping that Judge Noreika would rubber-stamp a deal that critics said gave most of its advantages to the defendant.\n\nDuring his July appearance, Mr. Biden was brought to the court on several misdemeanor charges related to his alleged willful failure to pay income tax, and possession of a firearm while being an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nBut under a proposed pretrial diversion agreement, Mr. Biden likely wouldn't have seen any jail time.\n\nUnder the preliminary agreement between Mr. Biden's attorneys and Mr. Weiss -- who wasn't a special counsel at the time -- Mr. Biden agreed to plead guilty to the tax charges in exchange for immunity from other potential tax, gun, and drug crimes that may have been committed during the period from 2014 to 2019. Prosecutors recommended probation as part of the deal.\n\nThe deal shocked critics, who condemned it as a \"sweetheart deal\" that came about due to collusion between the government and Mr. Biden's team.\n\nUltimately, Judge Noreika sided with the critics and, saying that the terms of the deal were far too broad, particularly in its provisions granting blanket immunity for a litany of crimes, she struck the plea agreement down.\n\nImmediately following this decision, Attorney General Merrick Garland finally promoted Mr. Weiss, who was in charge of the case, to special counsel, giving him far more control over which charges were brought in the case.\n\nHowever, critics have also been skeptical of Mr. Weiss for allowing the lenient deal in the first place, with many saying at the time that a different prosecutor should have been elevated to special counsel.\n\nIn any event, Judge Noreika's decision to reject the agreement was ultimately responsible for the case, which was never expected to see trial, to come before a jury.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Caleb_Boggs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Biden has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nThe charges include: false statement in purchase of a firearm; false statement related to information required to be kept by federal firearms licensed dealer; possession of a firearm by a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance.\n\nThe total maximum prison time for the charges could be up to 25 years. Each count carries a maximum fine of $250,000, and three years of supervised release.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN IS IN COURT IN DELAWARE. HERE'S WHAT HE DOESN'T WANT THE JURY TO HEAR\n\nBiden has had well-documented and admitted struggles with addiction, most notably with crack cocaine. He has since gone into recovery and has been sober since 2019, according to sworn testimony in federal court last year.\n\nProsecutors allege that in October 2018, Biden visited StarQuest Shooters & Survival Supply in Wilmington to purchase the Colt revolver, but say he lied about his drug addiction when he filled out a form for federal authorities to purchase the gun. Biden's form was ticked \"No\" when asked if he is an unlawful user of a firearm or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nJUDGE BARS PROSECUTORS FROM USING SOME SALACIOUS EVIDENCE IN HUNTER BIDEN'S GUN TRIAL\n\nFor the two charges related to the form, prosecutors in the case are working to prove to the jury that Biden filled out the form and knowingly made a false statement, and that he knowingly made the false statement because he believed he would not be able to purchase the gun otherwise. For the third charge, which relates to Biden's possession of a firearm while allegedly addicted to substances, prosecutors must prove that Biden was an unlawful user of a firearm or addicted to drugs, and that he knowingly possessed the firearm as an unlawful user or while addicted to drugs.\n\n\"Maybe it's the ultimate test for a recovering addict - I don't know,\" Biden told Axios earlier this year regarding the importance of his sobriety ahead of his dad's second election faceoff against former President Trump.\n\n\"I have always been in awe of people who have stayed clean and sober through tragedies and obstacles few people ever face. They are my heroes, my inspiration.\"\n\nPretrial motions are currently hashing out the definitions of \"addict\" and \"unlawful user\" to provide to the jury ahead of eventual jury deliberations.\n\nBiden has repeatedly acknowledged his addiction struggles, most notably in his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things: A Memoir.\"\n\n\"I spent more time on my hands and knees picking through rugs smoking anything that even remotely resembled crack cocaine. I probably smoked more parmesan cheese than anyone you know,\" he said during an interview promoting the book.\n\n\"I went one time for 13 days without sleeping, and smoking crack and drinking vodka throughout that entire time,\" he added.\n\nHe previously said his addictions stretch back years, including in the early 2000s when he began heavily drinking while working at law and lobbying firm Oldaker, Biden & Belair, the New York Times reported. In 2014, he was discharged from the Navy Reserves after he tested positive for cocaine use, while following his brother's death in 2015, he reported a return to the use of alcohol.\n\nIn 2016, Biden said his addiction to drugs spiraled, with him using crack cocaine, and going through a tumultuous divorce with his wife of 24 years, the New York Times reported.\n\nBiden's defense team had worked to toss the Delaware case in the lead-up to the trial, including a last-ditch effort that was denied by the court last week. The defense team has argued Biden had just completed a rehab program before the gun purchase and was not an active drug user at the time.\n\n\"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict,\" Biden attorney Abbe Lowell wrote in court documents.\n\nBiden was in possession of the firearm for about 11 days before police responded to a dumpster behind a shopping market, where they found the revolver, Fox News Digital previously reported. Biden was in a relationship with his late brother's widow at the time, Hallie Biden, who allegedly threw the gun in the dumpster.\n\nAMERICANS GUILTY OF CHARGES SIMILAR TO HUNTER NEVER GOT 'SWEETHEART' DEAL TO KEEP THEM FROM PRISON: CRITICS\n\nHallie Biden might be required to testify in the trial, and reportedly had an unexpected late-night visit from the president last month in the lead-up to the trial.\n\nThe White House said the president did not discuss the trial with Hallie, instead visiting her \"because of the approaching 9th anniversary of Beau's passing,\" the New York Post reported. Beau Biden, Hallie Biden's deceased husband and the president's eldest son, died of brain cancer on May 30, 2015.\n\nHunter Biden is now married to Melissa Cohen, whom he has credited with helping him overcome his drug addiction.\n\n\"The decision never felt rash or harebrained or reckless. It felt urgent,\" Biden wrote in his memoir of his marriage to Cohen in 2019. \"It felt like I'd been given a reprieve. I felt the astonishing luck of a man who'd agreed to meet a woman for coffee when it was all but impossible for him to leave a hotel room without a crack pipe in his hand, and who fell in love at first sight.\"\n\nThe trial will kick off on Monday with jury selection. Lowell has slammed the case as one that \"selectively charged\" Biden for political purposes, pointing to U.S. Attorney David Weiss, who is serving as special counsel in the case.\n\nWeiss was nominated to serve as U.S. attorney for the United States District Court for the District of Delaware by former President Trump, after the state's two Democratic senators, Chris Coons and Tom Carper, urged his nomination. Biden retained him in the position after assuming the White House. He also served as interim U.S. attorney under President Barack Obama.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN CRIMINAL TAX CASE ASSIGNED TO TRUMP-APPOINTED JUDGE IN DELAWARE\n\nFEDERAL COURT DENIES HUNTER BIDEN APPEAL IN DELAWARE FEDERAL GUN CHARGES CASE\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika will preside over the case. Trump nominated Noreika as a U.S. district judge in 2017, with the judge also garnering support from Democratic lawmakers. Fox News Digital previously reported she has donated at least $15,000 to political candidates of both parties since 1999.\n\nUpon her nomination, Noreika received support and praise from Democrats in the state, including Coons and Carper.\n\n\"Delaware's courts are renowned for their judges' expertise. Maryellen Noreika and Colm Connolly are two highly-respected, sought-after attorneys who have displayed a vast knowledge of the law and a thorough understanding of the courts during their extensive careers working in the Delaware judicial system,\" Carper said of Noreika's nomination in December 2017.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN SCHEDULED TO MAKE FIRST COURT APPEARANCE ON FEDERAL TAX CHARGES IN JULY\n\nThe trial is anticipated to last at least a week, and will not be televised. Biden is also facing a criminal tax trial in California, which will begin in September, after he was charged with three felonies and six misdemeanors regarding $1.4 million in owed taxes. The taxes have since been paid. Biden has pleaded not guilty in that case.\n\nThe trial follows the unprecedented NY v. Trump trial, which found the 45th president guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. Following the verdict, Biden highlighted that \"no one is above the law.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The American principle that no one is above the law was reaffirmed. Donald Trump was given every opportunity to defend himself. It was a state case, not a federal case. And it was heard by a jury of 12 citizens, 12 Americans, 12 people like you, like millions of Americans who've served on juries,\" Biden said at the White House. \"This jury is chosen the same way every jury in America is chosen. It was the process that Donald Trump's attorney was part of.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_colton@foxnews.com", "name": "Emma

Taken together, these decisions could make a tough case for Hunter Biden even more challenging to win. President Joe Biden's son has pleaded not guilty to illegally buying and owning a gun while abusing illicit drugs.\n\nNoreika granted a request from special counsel David Weiss to block one of Hunter Biden's expert witnesses from testifying. The defense had lined up a Columbia University-based psychiatrist who would've tried to poke holes in prosecutors' assertions that Hunter Biden knew he was an addict in 2018 when he bought the gun that led to his indictment.\n\n\"The inadequacy of Defendant's expert disclosure for Dr. (Elie) Aoun leaves the government in the dark as to what his opinions about the facts of this case will be, thus rendering the government unable to prepare for trial,\" Noreika wrote in her ruling.\n\nThe judge also blocked Hunter Biden's lawyers from using what they thought was a key piece of exculpatory evidence: an altered version of the federal firearms form he filled out when he bought the gun in 2018 that was tweaked in 2021 by the gun store employees.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers recently argued in court that they wanted to use the doctored form to undermine the credibility of the employees, who are slated to testify on behalf of the prosecutors. They also claimed it showed prosecutors were politically \"biased.\"\n\nBut Noreika ruled the altered version of the form was \"irrelevant and inadmissible,\" and she went on to blast Hunter Biden's team for pushing \"conspiratorial\" theories and \"unsupported rhetoric\" about the motivations of the Wilmington gun store employees.\n\n\"Any probative value it arguably has is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, and misleading the jury,\" she wrote, further adding that any attempts by the defense to use the altered form to demonstrate the employees' alleged political bias would have been \"unduly prejudicial and invites (jury) nullification.\"\n\nOnly the original form - known as ATF Form 4473 - will be shown to the jury.\n\nOn that form, Hunter Biden is accused of falsely swearing that he wasn't using or addicted to drugs, which allowed him to purchase the gun. Prosecutors contend he was still addicted to crack cocaine at that time, as he has described in his memoir.\n\nJury selection for the trial is slated to begin Monday morning in Wilmington.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marshall_cohen@cnn.com", "name": "Marshall Cohen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_witness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Expert witness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryellen_Noreika", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maryellen Noreika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exculpatory_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exculpatory evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admissible_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Admissible evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crack cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prejudice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco,_Firearms_and_Explosives", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show_Jumping", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show Jumping", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Airsoft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Airsoft", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap24092656027600.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

The judge in the case punched holes in the agreement, to the delight of Mr. Trump's allies in Congress who tried to scuttle that deal and have portrayed Hunter Biden's legal problems as equivalent to those of their party's 2024 presidential candidate in an effort to impeach President Biden.\n\nStill, it is the son -- not the father -- who will be on trial twice during an election year.

Hunter Biden, the president's son, goes on trial for gun charges beginning tomorrow. President Biden said last year, quote, \"My son has done nothing wrong,'\" Alexander said.\n\n\"The Wall Street Journal, as you see here, the editorial board said at the time, quote, 'That's a highly inappropriate message from a president. He's essentially telling prosecutors that they are wrong to bring an indictment because Hunter is innocent of any criminal behavior.' Why was it appropriate for President Biden to publicly comment on his son's case?\" Alexander continued.\n\n\"President Biden commented as a loving father, as I would hope any loving father would do. Hunter Biden of course is entitled, as was Donald Trump, to the presumption of innocence and to a trial by a jury of his peers,\" Jeffries responded.\n\nHe was alluding to the criminal indictments that Trump is trying to fend off as the former president runs for re-election ahead of what may be a 2020 rematch in November against the elder Biden.\n\n\"And this Justice Department is going to proceed in that fashion, present the facts and the law,\" Jeffries added. \"And then we'll all have to wait for a determination that is made by a jury as to Hunter Biden's guilt or innocence.\"\n\nHunter Biden faces two criminal indictments that arose out of the federal investigation into his conduct led by special counsel David Weiss. The first son has pleaded not guilty to gun and tax charges. His gun-related trial is expected to begin this week in Delaware.\n\nA jury returned a guilty verdict against Trump on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to allegedly cover up payments in a bid to conceal a tryst with adult film star Stormy Daniels as part of a \"catch-and-kill\" scheme to influence the 2016 election.

Biden has pleaded not guilty.\n\nA plea deal, which had been expected to lead to Biden admitting to a series of tax and gun offences in order to avoid prison time, fell through last summer, after Republicans argued Biden was receiving a \"sweetheart deal\", and tax investigators said politics had hampered their probe.\n\nThe trial, which is expected to take between three and five days, will be held in Delaware \"within walking distance\" of his father's campaign headquarters in Wilmington, said The New York Times (NYT).\n\nTwo of the charges each carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, while the third carries a maximum prison sentence of five years. But non-violent first-time offenders \"rarely get serious prison time for the charges\", said the NYT.\n\nHunter Biden's notorious laptop has \"become a symbol of the legal and political controversy surrounding the president's son in recent years\", said ABC News, and prosecutors hope to use its contents as evidence in the firearms trial.\n\nThe \"seedy contents\" of the laptop, left by Hunter at a Delaware repair shop, featured prominently in the 2020 presidential campaign, said the BBC. It has already \"provided proof\" of Hunter's considerable earnings from his work in China and Ukraine, which are \"stoking the nascent impeachment inquiry\" into President Biden.\n\nIn December, federal prosecutors filed nine new tax charges against Biden, claiming that he avoided paying at least $1.4 million (\u00a31.1 million) in self-assessed federal taxes he owed for between 2016 and 2019.\n\nAnnouncing charges that include failure to file and pay taxes, false tax return and evasion of assessment, the prosecutors claimed that, instead of paying what he owed, Biden splashed his money on \"drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing, and other items of a personal nature\".\n\nThey said he \"individually received more than $7m in total gross income\" between 2016 and mid-October 2020, but \"wilfully failed\" to pay his 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 taxes on time. He belatedly paid all his taxes and fines in 2020.\n\nThe hearing will \"hand a political weapon\" to Republicans \"desperate for a distracting issue\" in the wake of Donald Trump's 34-count conviction last week, said The Guardian.\n\nBut the Democrats could try and turn it to their favour, said CNN, as the trial could \"blunt claims by the GOP\" that the Justice Department targets only Republicans, particularly at a time when a Democratic senator, Robert Menendez of New Jersey, is also on trial in New York.\n\nThe White House has ruled out a pardon for Hunter, but the president insists his son did nothing wrong. In a \"symbolic show of support\", the president was seen with his son on a bike ride near his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, over the weekend.", "source": {"uri": "theweek.com", "dataType":

He is charged with two counts of providing false information on a form he filled when he bought a Colt Cobra revolver in 2018. He had wrongly said he was not using narcotics at the time, which he said at the time in an autobiography. The third count charges him with using narcotics while in possession of a firearm.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty.\n\nHunter Biden is being prosecuted by David Weiss, a US attorney appointed by Trump and elevated to special prosecutor by the Biden administration at his request so as to be able to conduct the case independently.\n\nPresident Biden can pardon his son if he is found guilty, but the White House has said he won't pardon do so.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, is likely to pardon himself in federal cases if he is elected as the President again. But he won't be able to pardon himself in the Manhattan case as it is a state case and presidential pardons can only be granted in federal cases.\n\nHe currently faces two federal cases -- one for mishandling classified documents after leaving office, and the second is about the January 6 insurrection in 2021.\n\nHe faces multiple charges in a state case of trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election outcome in Georgia.\n\nThe younger Biden also faces tax-related charges in California.\n\nRepublicans have used Hunter Biden, who struggled with drug addiction and failing relationships, to accuse the President of corruption. They tried first to implicate him in charges of bribery in Ukraine, which led instead to Trump's first of the two impeachments.\n\nPresident Biden has supported his son but has made no reported efforts to influence or end his prosecution by the Department of Justice, which is also prosecuting two senior Democratic lawmakers -- Senator Robert Menendez of alleged bribery in exchange for helping Egypt, and Congressman Enrique Roberto for alleged bribery by Azerbaijan.", "source": {"uri": "socialnews.xyz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social News XYZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Caleb Boggs federal courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nMr. Biden has been at the center of a series of controversies since the campaign era of the 2020 election cycle for a series of alleged personal, business, and legal failures.\n\nNow, the first son is about to face the prospect of a trial that's sure to be highly publicized and runs the risk of years in a federal penitentiary.\n\nThe trial will focus on allegedly untruthful statements that Mr. Biden made on a form to receive a firearm in 2018.\n\nThe start of the trial represents a fresh challenge for the embattled President Joe Biden, who just days ago wrote on X, \"Nobody is above the law\" after his 2024 rival, former President Donald Trump, was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in New York.\n\nThe first two charges relate to the allegedly untruthful statements Mr. Biden made on a form to receive a firearm that, under the terms of U.S. law, he wasn't allowed to possess.\n\nFor instance, the form asks whether the buyer has been convicted of a felony, whether they've been dishonorably discharged, if they're a fugitive, and -- crucially to Mr. Biden's case -- whether the prospective buyer is \"addicted to, or an unlawful user of\" marijuana or any other federally scheduled drug.\n\nAccording to the first two charges in Mr. Biden's indictment, he checked \"No\" in response to this last question despite his later admission to use of crack cocaine at the time.\n\nThis alleged untruthfulness constitutes a federal felony.\n\nThe third count in the indictment is related to the actual possession of the firearm, as federal law also prohibits those abusing drugs from possessing a gun.\n\nAt the center of the trial is Mr. Biden himself.\n\nThe trial will be overseen by Trump-appointed Federal Judge Maryellen Noreika, whose rejection of a proposed plea agreement last year brought about the trial.\n\nJudge Noreika has rebuffed efforts by Mr. Biden to toss out the case, but she has also given wins to both sides on key evidentiary questions in the case.\n\nLeading the case for the government is Mr. Weiss, a Trump-appointee who has himself faced a litany of criticisms from the right for allegedly being too lenient on Mr. Biden.\n\nFederal prosecutors in the case have said they plan to call in around a dozen witnesses -- most notably, they'll have three of Mr. Biden's former romantic partners testify.\n\nThe most high-profile of these is Hallie Biden, the wife of Mr. Biden's deceased brother Beau who engaged in a relationship with Mr. Biden following her husband's death in 2015.\n\nRecently, a visit to Ms. Biden by President Biden caused a short-lived media frenzy, with many critics raising concerns about possible witness tampering or intimidation.\n\nThe case will also feature testimony from Kathleen Buhle, Mr. Biden's ex-wife, and Lunden Roberts, the mother of one of his children.\n\nAround 250 Delawareans have been summoned to be prospective jurors in the case, Ms. Noreika has said.\n\nAs the trial gets underway, that number will be whittled down to 12 jurors and some alternates.\n\nGiven the political nature of the case, a key question for these jurors will likely be based on where they get their news. The same question was key during the jury selection in President Trump's New York trial.\n\nAttorneys will need to find jurors capable of being objective in the case, whatever their feelings toward President Biden and the first family.\n\nFor Mr. Biden himself, it means the difference between freedom and confinement: if convicted, Mr. Biden faces as much as 25 years in a federal penitentiary.\n\nThat said, Mr. Biden would be a first-time offender who's unlikely to face nearly that much time.\n\nStill, if he's convicted of all three charges there's a good chance he could spend months or years behind bars.\n\nThe case also could have broad political ramifications at a time that the campaign stump and the courtroom are more closely linked in politics than ever.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has said that President Biden wouldn't pardon his son if he was found guilty.\n\nBut should President Biden lose his reelection bid in November, he could find himself facing a great deal of pressure from his family to pardon his son before leaving the White House.\n\nA conviction could have a limited impact on President Biden's campaign.\n\nPolls show that most voters don't blame the alleged sins of the son on the father, but some do: That could be deadly in a race that could be decided by a tilt margin in some battleground states.\n\nFor Republicans, the case could take some of the media attention off of President Trump and put it back onto President Biden.\n\nShould Mr. Biden be acquitted, Republicans could use the acquittal to continue their claims that the judicial system has been fundamentally broken and politicized by actors within the Department of Justice.\n\nLast year, Mr. Biden appeared in the same courthouse where he'll be tried.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Biden was hoping that Judge Noreika would rubber-stamp a deal that critics said gave most of its advantages to the defendant.\n\nDuring his July appearance, Mr. Biden was brought to the court on several misdemeanor charges related to his alleged willful failure to pay income tax, and possession of a firearm while being an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nBut under a proposed pretrial diversion agreement, Mr. Biden likely wouldn't have seen any jail time.\n\nUnder the preliminary agreement between Mr. Biden's attorneys and Mr. Weiss -- who wasn't a special counsel at the time -- Mr. Biden agreed to plead guilty to the tax charges in exchange for immunity from other potential tax, gun, and drug crimes that may have been committed during the period from 2014 to 2019. Prosecutors recommended probation as part of the deal.\n\nThe deal shocked critics, who condemned it as a \"sweetheart deal\" that came about due to collusion between the government and Mr. Biden's team.\n\nUltimately, Judge Noreika sided with the critics and, saying that the terms of the deal were far too broad, particularly in its provisions granting blanket immunity for a litany of crimes, she struck the plea agreement down.\n\nImmediately following this decision, Attorney General Merrick Garland finally promoted Mr. Weiss, who was in charge of the case, to special counsel, giving him far more control over which charges were brought in the case.\n\nHowever, critics have also been skeptical of Mr. Weiss for allowing the lenient deal in the first place, with many saying at the time that a different prosecutor should have been elevated to special counsel.\n\nIn any event, Judge Noreika's decision to reject the agreement was ultimately responsible for the case, which was never expected to see trial, to come before a jury.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Caleb_Boggs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

He has pleaded not guilty to the charge.\n\nA form released by prosecutors shows Mr Biden did indeed tick \"no\" to a question asking whether he was an \"unlawful user\" or \"addicted to\" illegal drugs.\n\nBy his own admission 2018 was a tumultuous time for Mr Biden who had lost his brother, Beau Biden, 46, to brain cancer three years earlier.\n\nHe has admitted regularly meeting prostitutes, taking an array of illegal substances and experiencing mental health problems in the same period.\n\nThe former lawyer wrote in his memoir, Beautiful Things, that he had become addicted to crack cocaine after his brother's death in 2015.\n\nThe book will form part of Mr Weiss's case which will also involve extended discussion of text messages between Mr Biden and his girlfriend.\n\nIn the two days after he purchased the revolver on Oct 12, prosecutors say he sent messages to his partner on Oct 13 and 14 about buying drugs in Delaware.\n\nEleven days after he bought the gun, his girlfriend discarded it into a skip, believing it was a risk to his safety.\n\nIn messages disclosed in prosecution documents, he wrote:\n\nIn further messages over the next two months he told others:\n\nAt the time his father Joe Biden was preparing to launch a bid for the White House in the 2020 election where he would defeat Donald Trump.\n\nRepublicans have sought to weaponise the two cases against him (including a trial for tax evasion in California scheduled for later in 2024) and the alleged involvement of his father in his Ukrainian business dealings. He denies the tax charges.\n\nSome hope that two colourful cases and a congressional inquiry led by Jim Jordan, the GOP inquisitor, will be enough to minimise the impact of Mr Trump's own legal battles in 2024.\n\nHunter Biden has remained close to his father and stepmother, Jill Biden, appearing with the couple for annual diary events such as the White House Easter Egg Roll.\n\nOn Monday Mrs Biden turned up to watch the jury selection at the federal district court in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nMr Biden's defence team is set to argue that he has been unfairly targeted by the Department of Justice, which took the unusual step of appointing a special counsel to investigate him in August 2023.\n\nEarlier in 2023 Mr Biden was offered a plea deal that would have seen him admit to two tax evasion misdemeanours and avoid punishment for the gun charge.\n\nThe deal had been partly designed to avoid well-publicised trials during his father's re-election campaign, but it fell apart after the two legal teams and judge could not agree on the terms of his legal immunity.\n\nInstead, the trial is set to become a two-week circus that Republicans will use to make political points about his father, just a week after the Trump verdicts produced some good headlines for the Biden administration.\n\nThe trial continues.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, appeared on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" to discuss the obvious issues of the day.\n\nFirst and foremost, obviously, was former President Donald Trump's conviction on 34 counts in a kangaroo court in Jeffries' home turf of New York City.\n\nThe minority leader made it clear where he stood while continuing to contend, against all reliable evidence, that President Joe Biden had made real gains for the American people in his three-and-a-half years in office.\n\n\"Extreme MAGA Republicans are going to continue to lie for Donald Trump. President Biden and Democrats are going to continue to solve problems for hard-working American taxpayers,\" Jeffries claimed.\n\n\"Extreme MAGA Republicans will continue to lie for Donald Trump,\" he said again.\n\nWhat those lies are went unnamed, but one can assume that they had to do with pointing out just how kangaroo the court in New York City was, given the question being asked.\n\nAll right, then, Rep. Jeffries: What about Hunter Biden? Do you think it was proper for the president to say, last year, that the first son \"has done nothing wrong\" before he was indicted on numerous federal violations?\n\nOf course it was, he said.\n\nAnswering a question regarding a Wall Street Journal editorial that called out the president's remarks before Hunter Biden's gun charges go to trial this coming week, Jeffries told host Peter Alexander that \"President Biden commented as a loving father, as I would hope any loving father would do.\"\n\n\"Hunter Biden of course is entitled, as was Donald Trump, to the presumption of innocence and to a trial by a jury of his peers,\" the congressman said.\n\n\"And this Justice Department is going to proceed in that fashion, present the facts and the law. And then we'll all have to wait for a determination that is made by a jury as to Hunter Biden's guilt or innocence,\" he said.\n\nNow, firstly, I think we should be clear on the timeline of this, because Jeffries was being a bit disingenuous here and Alexander wasn't willing to call him out on it.\n\nIn May 2023, during an interview with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle, Biden insisted that his son was innocent of pretty much anything under the sun.\n\n\"First of all, my son has done nothing wrong,\" the president said. \"I trust him. I have faith in him.\"\n\nBiden said the only effect was \"making me feel proud of him.\"\n\nThis is before Hunter was given a sweetheart deal by his father's Department of Justice that collapsed in court after a judge rejected it as unprecedented and potentially unconstitutional.\n\nIt was also before, due to an impasse created by the rejection of the plea deal, the attorney general was forced to announce an independent special counsel who went on to indict Hunter on gun charges in September and tax charges in December.\n\nThus, Biden wasn't just acting as a loving father. He was acting as the sitting president and a recently declared candidate for re-election stating that his son was clean at a whistle, legally speaking, at the same time he knew that son was being investigated by the federal government for behavior that, at the very least, was ethically indefensible.\n\nHunter Biden is \"entitled ... to the presumption of innocence and to a trial by a jury of his peers,\" of course.\n\nHowever, what the first son isn't entitled to is the president using his office to dissuade charges from being filed against him. That's exactly what Joe Biden did -- and it wasn't an act of love, or at least primarily an act of love. It was an act of hide-saving.\n\nFurthermore, what we knew about Hunter Biden didn't materially change over the course of 2023. We knew that the first son had probably lied on a federal gun form that required him to list if he was an abuser of or an addict to any illegal or controlled substances; Hunter had more or less admitted that he was during the time that the gun was purchased in his autobiography \"Beautiful Things.\" We knew about his tax problems, too.\n\nNor was this merely about saving Hunter, as the media has reported; his son's legal woes apparently have had quite a psychological toll on the president, as well.\n\n\"He worries about Hunter every single day, from the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to sleep. That will only pick up during a trial,\" an adviser told Politico last month.\n\nSo, the president essentially putting his rhetorical thumb on the scales of justice isn't an outrage, but \"extreme MAGA Republicans [who] are going to continue to lie for Donald Trump\" are, as Jeffries said in this postverdict interview.\n\nImagine, for a second, if Hakeem Jeffries were a Republican and the president were still Donald Trump. He would be eaten alive by the media.\n\nHere, Alexander didn't even bother asking a follow-up question. He let this stand as if there were no issue whatsoever.\n\nIt's yet another object lesson in why, if it weren't for double standards, the establishment media wouldn't have any standards at all.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "c_douglas_golden@westernjournal.com", "name": "C.

He receives updates from his aides each morning on the war in Gaza and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He calls his advisers to quiz them about the latest polls and headlines.\n\nBut at the top of that list, people who know him say, is a concern that nags at him as a father: the legal problems of his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nHunter Biden, 54, is scheduled to stand trial this week in a federal court in Delaware on charges that he failed to disclose his drug addiction on a form when buying a gun in 2018. His legal team has called the charges politically motivated, and his attorneys intend to challenge the notion that Hunter Biden improperly filled out the form.\n\nThe president has weathered years of personal and legal scandals surrounding his son, who has battled alcoholism and addiction, and the trial is the most serious legal problem facing him since Mr. Biden was elected to the presidency. But Mr. Biden has refused to shut out his son or treat him as a political liability -- in fact, the president has a tendency to pull his son closer the worse things seem to get.\n\nFather and son were spotted on a bicycle ride and at church on Saturday afternoon in Delaware. Earlier in the week, they were together to mark the anniversary of the death of Beau Biden, the president's eldest son who died of brain cancer on May 30, 2015. The Biden family had gathered in Delaware when news broke that former President Donald J. Trump, Mr. Biden's Republican challenger, had been convicted of 34 counts in a federal hush-money trial involving a payoff to an adult film star before the 2016 election.\n\nHunter Biden has fielded questions from friends who have approached to ask him how he is doing. At a state dinner honoring Kenya in late May, the veteran Democratic operative Donna Brazile, who has known the Bidens since the 1980s, asked him how he was doing.

The judge also plans to ask them if their views on the 2024 election would affect their impartiality and if they believe Biden being the son of a president has caused him to be prosecuted more or less than what is fair.\n\nThe day before the trial, Noreika dealt blows to Biden's defense team, including denying his request to allow one of his expert witnesses, a psychiatrist, to testify about drug addiction, according to court orders.\n\nBiden's attorneys had wanted the doctor to testify that addicts commonly are in a \"state of denial\" about their addiction, which would help them argue Biden thought that when he allegedly said on the gun form that he was not an illegal drug user, he was being truthful.\n\nWeiss has indicated he plans to introduce evidence at trial that shows investigators tested a leather gun pouch they retrieved in 2018 for drugs and found evidence of cocaine on it.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nFor a second expert witness, Biden's attorneys asked to call a toxicologist to the stand to dispute the chain of command of the pouch.

Noreika said she would reserve judgment on whether to allow the witness to testify.\n\nNoreika also denied Biden's attorneys' request to permit evidence of a second version of the gun form Biden allegedly filled out that included updated information on it. The attorneys planned to incorporate the form into their defense by saying the second form on record with the gun shop was \"doctored.\" The judge called this \"unsupported rhetoric.\"\n\nThe trial is also expected to be highly personal for Biden, as prosecutors have said they plan to call his ex-wife and two ex-girlfriends to the stand to serve as witnesses to his alleged drug abuse in 2018.\n\nThe prosecutors also said they will present excerpts from Biden's memoir Beautiful Things, in which the first son vividly detailed how he battled for years with an addiction to crack.\n\nBiden, who said he became sober in 2019, has pleaded not guilty to three gun charges he is facing. If convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though receiving the maximum penalty is highly unlikely.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nBiden also attempted to have his case dismissed on several grounds, including that a Supreme Court ruling in recent years that relaxed gun regulations rendered the charges unconstitutional. Noreika denied the request but said he could raise it again after the trial.\n\nWhile his father has, as president, advocated stricter gun laws, the first son's case is one gun rights activists see as an opportunity to shape gun regulation in their favor.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

I think he's troubled and you can't have any privacy with your troubles and just keep it a family matter.\"\n\nShe thinks it's good that the jury selection process doesn't automatically strike any New Castle County resident who has simply met a Biden family member: \"I mean, it's not like we're Manhattan.\"\n\nPerhaps Newark's Nakishia Williams Bailey doesn't know the Bidens quite as well as Miller, but she too says she couldn't be impartial if she landed before a judge in the case.\n\nHer father, Wilson Williams, knew Biden from his 39-year career at Chrysler's Newark Assembly plant, where he also held local and national office in the United Auto Workers union.\n\nThat connection -- and total happenstance -- led to Biden being a guest speaker at a Thanksgiving comedy fundraiser in 2015 at Penn Cinema Riverfront 14 + IMAX in Wilmington, run by Bailey's Events by Nakishia.\n\nWilson spotted Biden leaving a film in the halls of the movie theater, the pair had a chat and when Biden heard about the fundraiser, he asked if he could pop in and say a few words.\n\nSoon, the stand-up comedy program took an unplanned break and the Vice President of the United States appeared. Standing in front of the theater, he gave a nearly 15-minute of-the-cuff speech at the event, which raised money for the Sunday Breakfast Mission and Food Bank of Delaware.\n\nBiden has also attended the Martin Luther King Jr. Day prayer breakfast she helps organize each year in New Castle County and she, too, bumps into him by coincidence, including once at a Walgreens pharmacy.\n\nAll that adds up to her not being able to be objective in this case, says Bailey, a human resources manager, before adding, \"And I have a feeling there are going to be a lot of folks like that.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika is overseeing Hunter Biden's trial, which kicks off today and will bring plenty of national media attention to the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building.\n\nIn a twist highlighting the tight-knit nature of this tiny state, the courthouse is named for the former U.S. senator that then-underdog Biden surprisingly beat in 1972 to begin his career in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe trial is expected to continue through next week.\n\nProsecutors claim Hunter Biden broke federal law by reportedly lying about his addiction to drugs when he bought a gun in New Castle County in 2018.\n\nThe indictment against Hunter Biden charges him with knowingly deceiving a firearms dealer by buying a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver on Oct. 12, 2018. He is charged with falsely filling out a federal form denying he was addicted to any narcotics. He is also charged with knowingly possessing the revolver despite the restrictions against people addicted to drugs owning firearms.\n\nHunter Biden has acknowledged he was struggling with addiction at the time.\n\nHe faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted - five years for the false statement to the dealer, 10 years for the false statement on the federal form and 10 years for possession of the firearm - but actual sentences typically are shorter than the maximum, according to the Justice Department.\n\nNot everyone who has met President Biden over the years believes they couldn't be impartial. In fact, having an interaction or some knowledge of the family could help give a juror more insight, says Greenville's Jacobson.\n\nJacobson lives off Barley Mill Road, less than a mile from President Biden's home, and has not only spotted him in the wild, she ended up on the national news the day she took a photograph with him.\n\nIt happened on Election Day in 2020, the day the nation was choosing between Biden and President Donald Trump to lead the country.

I think he's troubled and you can't have any privacy with your troubles and just keep it a family matter.\"\n\nShe thinks it's good that the jury selection process doesn't automatically strike any New Castle County resident who has simply met a Biden family member: \"I mean, it's not like we're Manhattan.\"\n\nPerhaps Newark's Nakishia Williams Bailey doesn't know the Bidens quite as well as Miller, but she too says she couldn't be impartial if she landed before a judge in the case.\n\nHer father, Wilson Williams, knew Biden from his 39-year career at Chrysler's Newark Assembly plant, where he also held local and national office in the United Auto Workers union.\n\nThat connection -- and total happenstance -- led to Biden being a guest speaker at a Thanksgiving comedy fundraiser in 2015 at Penn Cinema Riverfront 14 + IMAX in Wilmington, run by Bailey's Events by Nakishia.\n\nWilson spotted Biden leaving a film in the halls of the movie theater, the pair had a chat and when Biden heard about the fundraiser, he asked if he could pop in and say a few words.\n\nSoon, the stand-up comedy program took an unplanned break and the Vice President of the United States appeared. Standing in front of the theater, he gave a nearly 15-minute of-the-cuff speech at the event, which raised money for the Sunday Breakfast Mission and Food Bank of Delaware.\n\nBiden has also attended the Martin Luther King Jr. Day prayer breakfast she helps organize each year in New Castle County and she, too, bumps into him by coincidence, including once at a Walgreens pharmacy.\n\nAll that adds up to her not being able to be objective in this case, says Bailey, a human resources manager, before adding, \"And I have a feeling there are going to be a lot of folks like that.\"\n\nTrial expected to run through next week\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika is overseeing Hunter Biden's trial, which kicks off today and will bring plenty of national media attention to the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building.\n\nIn a twist highlighting the tight-knit nature of this tiny state, the courthouse is named for the former U.S. senator that then-underdog Biden surprisingly beat in 1972 to begin his career in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe trial is expected to continue through next week.\n\nProsecutors claim Hunter Biden broke federal law by reportedly lying about his addiction to drugs when he bought a gun in New Castle County in 2018.\n\nThe indictment against Hunter Biden charges him with knowingly deceiving a firearms dealer by buying a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver on Oct. 12, 2018. He is charged with falsely filling out a federal form denying he was addicted to any narcotics. He is also charged with knowingly possessing the revolver despite the restrictions against people addicted to drugs owning firearms.\n\nHunter Biden has acknowledged he was struggling with addiction at the time.\n\nHe faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted - five years for the false statement to the dealer, 10 years for the false statement on the federal form and 10 years for possession of the firearm - but actual sentences typically are shorter than the maximum, according to the Justice Department.\n\nThey've met a Biden and say they could be impartial\n\nNot everyone who has met President Biden over the years believes they couldn't be impartial. In fact, having an interaction or some knowledge of the family could help give a juror more insight, says Greenville's Jacobson.\n\nJacobson lives off Barley Mill Road, less than a mile from President Biden's home, and has not only spotted him in the wild, she ended up on the national news the day she took a photograph with him.\n\nIt happened on Election Day in 2020, the day the nation was choosing between Biden and President Donald Trump to lead the country. Jacobson and her partner Jon Tumler just happened to be voting at Alexis I. du Pont High School in Greenville when they bumped into the future president.\n\nThey asked if they could take a photograph with him and ended up getting a hug along with the photo, footage of which ended up on cable news.\n\nIt wasn't the first time they saw their famous neighbor or his wife around, having seen them in Greenville spots such as menswear retailer Jos. A Bank and the Whimsy Boutique gift shop.\n\n\"I could be totally impartial and I think to be eliminated from the jury because you're acquainted with the Biden family would be unfair,\" she says. \"If you're acquainted with them, you know their character. So like it or not, you actually may be able to balance things out in a way that others could not.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN IN COURT Hunter Biden appears in Wilmington court ahead of looming gun trial. Here's what happened\n\nDELAWARE'S SHORT-LIVED TOUR DE TRUMP Do you remember when the president best known for biking in Delaware was Trump not Biden?\n\n\"There are a lot of people who don't know the Bidens and think ill of them.

I just think that's his ethics.\"", "source": {"uri": "delawareonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundraising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fundraising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Castle_County,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Castle County, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Castle County, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Family of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenville,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Greenville, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greenville, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Joseph_on_the_Brandywine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Joseph on the Brandywine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voir_dire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voir dire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teacher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AstraZeneca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Breakfast_Mission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunday Breakfast Mission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salon.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryellen_Noreika", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maryellen Noreika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Auto_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Auto Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Caleb_Boggs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

The jury of 12, and four alternates, will be selected from that pool after being asked if they are influenced by the fact the Hunter is Joe Biden's son, if they have made financial contributions to any political parties, or have themselves run for political office.\n\nOnce the jurors are selected, the trial is expected to last two weeks.\n\nThe defense has already suffered a number of setbacks. It initially relied on a plea deal with the prosecution whereby the younger Biden would plead guilty to various tax-related charges if the gun charges were dropped. But that deal fell through, thanks to a ruling by the Trump-nominated judge in this trial, Maryellen Noreika.\n\nLast night, Noreika made it even more difficult for Biden's defense by disallowing an \"expert\" witness to poke holes in the prosecution's likely claim that Biden knew what he was doing when he purchased the firearm. She also tossed the claim that the federal Form 4473 Biden completed had been altered by the gun store's employees.\n\nWhat's left for the defense is how the actual question that Biden answered is worded, and whether he answered it truthfully or not. The question from the Form 4473 is: \"Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?\"\n\nBiden's defense team will likely claim that he answered it \"no\" truthfully, since he had just completed an 11-day drug rehab session and was therefore \"clean.\" Noreika laid down the rules on May 24 when she decided that the jury may consider whether or not Biden was \"generally\" under the influence when he purchased the firearm.\n\nBiden himself provided the answer in his ill-timed and highly revealing memoir, Beautiful Things, in which he admitted to using cocaine every 15 minutes during the time of his purchase of the firearm.\n\nHe is being charged with not only lying on the form, but also acknowledging that \"making any false oral or written statement, or exhibiting any false or misrepresented identification with respect to this transaction, is a crime punishable as a felony under Federal law.\"\n\nIf convicted, the younger Biden could spent 15 years in jail. As a first offender, though, he is likely to spend little time behind bars.\n\nWhy then would the trial take the estimated two weeks? He lied. He knew he lied. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200. Go directly to jail.\n\nFirst, he is the president's son. He belongs to that special class of criminals and miscreants who can violate all manner of laws and get away with them.\n\nSecond, it's political season. Everything is being done through that optic: Will a conviction serve the Biden family interests? Will his conviction affect the presidential election? The question of guilt or innocence likely will play only a secondary role.\n\nThird, Biden the younger will immediately face a second trial for the much-more serious charges of deliberately and intentionally failing to pay taxes on more than $7 million he allegedly \"earned\" in 2017 and 2018.\n\nAnd that is putting extreme pressure on the younger Biden's defense team, headed up by Abbe Lowell. Not only does Lowell represent Biden today and for the next two weeks, he also will be defending him from the more serious federal charges of income tax evasion when that trial begins in California on June 20.\n\nLowell is already having trouble lining up witnesses in the present trial, likely due to lack of finances. Despite \"earning\" $7 million (we leave the question of just how the younger Biden earned that $7 million for another day and another discussion), he is essentially broke. Biden has had to lean on a close friend, Kevin Morris, a Hollywood entertainment lawyer, for financial assistance. At last count, Morris had admitted to \"loaning\" Biden more than $6 million over the past four years to help him pay his legal fees.\n\nBut now Morris is tapped out. This is according to a close personal, but unnamed, associate of Morris, who told Politico, \"Four and a half years later ... Kevin is completely tapped out. So just when Hunter is facing two criminal trials ... he has no resources. It's pretty dire.\"\n\nThe witnesses typically would be paid up to $500 an hour for their testimony. And Lowell himself charges as much as $1,500 an hour for his own personal attention to Biden's defense. CNN reported back in October that the younger Biden has racked up more than $10 million in legal bills over the years. And this doesn't count the paternity suit he is facing and the lawsuit from his former wife, who claims that Biden has been derelict in paying her some $37,000 a month in alimony since their divorce.\n\nOnce selected, the jury will take the next two weeks to consider whether or not Biden the Younger really knew what he was doing when he filled out that notorious Form 4473.", "source":

During that period, prosecutors allege he lied about his substance abuse on a federal form to illegally purchase a firearm.\n\nSpecial Counsel David Weiss has indicated he plans to raise painful events from the Biden family\u2019s past related to Hunter\u2019s conduct and events that involve the president. Still, White House officials largely view the trial as a private matter for Biden\u2019s son tied to his personal behaviour from years ago.\n\nThe president, who is expected to travel to France during part of the trial, will be monitoring it primarily as a concerned parent who has supported his son\u2019s recovery from addiction, according to a person familiar with his thinking.\n\nThere are no plans for the White House to publicly engage with the trial, said the person, who requested anonymity to discuss how the president and his staff view the legal matter. But those plans could change, and the person did not rule out the possibility of the president reacting to developments in real time.\n\nWhile the possibility exists for a last-minute plea deal between the two sides, Hunter Biden\u2019s legal team is prepared to argue the charges are unconstitutional and violate the Second Amendment, as well as point out flaws in the government\u2019s evidence.\n\nDick Harpootlian, a Biden ally and former South Carolina prosecutor, said jurors in Biden\u2019s home state might wonder why prosecutors brought the criminal case against him now that he\u2019s shaken his drug addiction.\n\n\u201cIt only takes one for a hung jury, and I can definitely see one or more jurors questioning the propriety of bringing this case,\u201d said Harpootlian, who now serves as a state senator.\n\nBiden\u2019s trial represents another highly politicised spectacle following the former President Trump\u2019s criminal trial in New York, which ended Thursday with his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up an affair with a porn star during the 2016 race.\n\nHunter Biden also has been charged by Weiss in Los Angeles for nine federal tax violations and is scheduled to go on trial in that case in September.\n\nThe gun trial is expected to be short but dramatic, with prosecutors airing details about Hunter Biden\u2019s drug-laden years that include excerpts from a book he wrote about it, Beautiful Things: A Memoir.\n\n\u201cHis book is replete with admissions that establish he knew he was an addict and knew he was using crack cocaine throughout 2018, including in October 2018 when he purchased and possessed the gun,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a May 20 trial brief.\n\nFordham University law professor Cheryl Bader, an ex-assistant US attorney who now runs the school\u2019s criminal-law clinic, said Biden\u2019s chances of winning an acquittal are slim given his acknowledgement in his memoir.\n\nBiden has been open about his struggles with alcohol and drugs but said he has remained sober since mid-2019.\n\nFederal prosecutors \u201conly bring cases that they are confident they can win, and they are known for dotting their I\u2019s and crossing their T\u2019s,\u201d Bader said.\n\nTwo of the gun counts carry maximum prison time of 10 years; another is punishable by as much as five years. However, judges rarely impose maximum sentences.\n\nBiden\u2019s lawyers plan to challenge the government\u2019s charge that he bought the gun while a drug addict as constitutionally vague. They are set to argue that he wasn\u2019t using drugs when he bought the gun. They also plan to contend that the seller didn\u2019t comply with legal requirements in the gun sale and documentation.\n\n\u201cIntoxication from too much alcohol or using drugs, legal or illegal, may make it too dangerous for people to drive a car, operate heavy machinery, or possess a firearm one day, but they may be perfectly sober enough to do all those things the next day,\u201d according to a May 23 trial brief by Biden\u2019s lawyers.\n\nWeiss was nominated by Trump to serve as the US attorney for Delaware and kept on by Biden. He was appointed as a special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2023 to manage the cases against Hunter Biden.\n\nBiden and Weiss had agreed to a plea deal last year to resolve both allegations, but the agreement fell apart under questioning by the federal judge overseeing the case. Biden\u2019s lawyers and supporters have argued that Weiss then bowed to political pressure by Trump and conservatives in bringing the charges.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news",

Quickly.", "body": "Ms. Isgur is a senior editor at The Dispatch and the host of the legal podcast \"Advisory Opinions.\" She served in the Department of Justice from 2017-2019 as the director of the Office of Public Affairs and senior counsel to the deputy attorney general during the Russia investigation.\n\nHunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted on three felony gun charges in a trial that is set to begin in Wilmington, Del., on Monday. In the meantime, his father is behind in many polls, his financial benefactor is reportedly \"tapped out\" and his best legal arguments require gutting federal gun control laws. An embarrassing trial that he is likely to lose will only make things worse.\n\nAn early plea agreement -- in which he agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and enter into a deferred prosecution agreement on the gun charges -- fell apart last summer. But a criminal defendant can accept a plea deal from the prosecution anytime before the jury returns its verdict, which means that he might still have a chance to avoid a full trial.\n\nIf he can, he should.\n\nTo bring federal charges, the Department of Justice manual advises that a prosecutor should believe that the defendant is guilty, that the prosecutor believes he has evidence that will prove the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the prosecutor believes that a reasonable jury would convict the defendant. In practice, this means that once the Department of Justice has indicted you, they believe they will win. And they almost always do.\n\nOver a 12-month period ending last fall, just 290 of the nearly 72,000 federal criminal defendants charged by the Justice Department were acquitted at trial. That's less than one half of 1 percent. (Of course, only 1,379 were convicted at trial -- a paltry 2 percent.) The vast majority facing a D.O.J. indictment decided either to plead guilty outright or accept a plea deal, believing that the prosecutor had correctly weighed their chances of winning in front of a jury before bringing the case in the first place.\n\nHunter Biden has argued that he was only charged because of his last name. And he has a point -- there are far more gun crimes committed than can be handled by federal prosecutors. The main charge is that he had a gun while using cocaine, which is a rarely used part of the statute. But that's usually because drug use is hard to prove compared to other gun charges, like being a felon with a gun. Here, though, prosecutors have noted that \"investigators literally found drugs on the pouch where the defendant had kept his gun.\" And when prosecutors do bring this charge, people who are found guilty are often sentenced to real prison time -- over a year for someone in Hunter Biden's shoes.\n\nThat would be enough of an incentive for most people to plead guilty to federal gun charges.

He had said in his memoir that he was battling a severe crack addiction at the time. The charges include lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, falsely claiming on the firearms application that he was not a drug user, and illegally possessing the gun for 11 days.\n\nHunter has pleaded not guilty, maintaining that he is being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department.\n\nIn a court order issued on Sunday, the judge first granted special counsel David Weiss's request to exclude one of Hunter's expert witnesses. The blocked testimony was to be provided by a Columbia University-based psychiatrist, who was prepared to challenge the prosecution's claim that Biden was aware of his addiction in 2018 when he purchased the firearm, which is the center of the indictment.\n\n\"The inadequacy of Defendant's expert disclosure for Dr. (Elie) Aoun leaves the government in the dark as to what his opinions about the facts of this case will be, thus rendering the government unable to prepare for trial,\" Judge Noreika wrote in the order.\n\nThe judge also ruled against allowing a key piece of evidence that Hunter's lawyers intended to use -- an altered version of the federal firearms form that Hunter filled when he bought the gun in 2018. This version, modified in 2021 by gun store employees, was intended to cast doubt on the credibility of those employees, who are expected to testify for the prosecution.\n\nThe defense argued that the altered form demonstrated political bias in the prosecution's case.\n\nHowever, Judge Noreika deemed the altered form \"irrelevant and inadmissible,\" criticizing the defense for advancing \"conspiratorial\" theories and \"unsupported rhetoric\" about the motivations of the Wilmington gun store employees.\n\n\"Any probative value it arguably has is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, and misleading the jury,\" she wrote.\n\nThe judge added that any attempts by the defense to use the altered form to demonstrate the employees' alleged political bias would have been \"unduly prejudicial and invites (jury) nullification.\"", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kiran_tom_sajan@ibtimes.com", "name": "Kiran Tom Sajan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_witness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Expert witness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryellen_Noreika", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maryellen Noreika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Court order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "License"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admissible_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Admissible evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prejudice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Education", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4513103/hunter-biden-walks-back-motorcade-after-visiting-jewelry-store-his-father-us-president-joe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Here's why. - The Boston Globe", "body": "In reality, few people fitting Biden's profile -- a first-time, nonviolent offender accused of lying on a federal firearms application, who never used the gun (in his case, a Colt Cobra .38 that he held on to for less than two weeks five years ago) to commit a crime -- get serious prison time for the offenses charged in the indictment.\n\nJust bringing the charges is out of the ordinary in some ways, former law enforcement officials say, and the legal basis of the prosecution is under constitutional challenge.\n\nHere's a rundown of the accusations against President Joe Biden's son and what makes the case unusual.\n\nThe indictment returned by a federal grand jury in Wilmington, Delaware, charged Hunter Biden with three felonies: lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail; making a false claim on the federal firearms application used to screen applicants, with a sentence of up to five years; and possession of an illegally obtained gun from Oct. 12 to Oct. 23, 2018, which carries a maximum of 10 years.\n\nThe charges stem from the purchase of a handgun by Biden at one of the low points of his troubled life. He had been addicted to crack cocaine, bouncing in and out of rehab, and was divorced, using prostitutes and having money problems. The New York Times reported this year that Biden later recounted to friends going into the gun store on a whim and buying the .38 because he thought spending time at a shooting range would help him avoid using drugs.\n\nIn purchasing the gun, Biden had to fill out a federal background check form. In response to a question on the form about whether he was using drugs, Biden said he was not -- an assertion that prosecutors concluded was false.\n\nThe first two charges against Biden are essentially the same: that he lied about his drug use to illegally obtain the weapon and that he falsely claimed he was not \"addicted to any stimulant, narcotic drug, and any other controlled substance\" on the federal form, known as a 4473.\n\nThe third charge, illegal possession of the gun while under the influence of drugs, stems from the time he had the weapon. Hallie Biden, his brother Beau's widow -- and his romantic partner at the time -- eventually discovered the gun and threw it into a dumpster.\n\nThe section of federal law cited in the indictment, 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 922, is the main statute used to define who can and cannot possess a firearm. It bans drug users, people convicted of felonies whose punishment exceeds a one-year prison sentence, fugitives from justice, people judged to be \"mentally defective,\" and those receiving dishonorable discharges from the military.\n\nA substantial percentage of those accused of lying on a federal firearms application, like Hunter Biden has been, are not indicted on that charge unless they are also accused of a more serious underlying crime, current and former law enforcement officials said. Most negotiate deals that include probation and enrollment in programs that include counseling, monitoring and regular drug testing.\n\n\"It is rare as a stand-alone,\" said John Fishwick Jr., who served as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia from 2015 to 2017. \"These charges are usually brought against convicted felons who illegally possess a gun or who commit a violent or drug-related charge.\"\n\nProsecutions for lying to a dealer are relatively rare, averaging fewer than 300 per year. There were some 25 million to 30 million background checks performed annually around the time of Biden's gun purchase, according to statistics obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nCharges of illegal firearms possession are much more common. But they too are most often used as an add-on, to leverage plea deals or to ensure that a defendant is convicted on at least one charge if there are doubts that they will be convicted on an underlying charge, Fishwick and other former prosecutors said.\n\nIn May, for example, when more than 20 people in Savannah, Georgia, were sentenced to from 10 months to 12 years in prison after pleading guilty to illegal firearms possession, all of them had criminal records or were caught in the act of committing another crime.\n\nWhen officials with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives reviewed Biden's gun application several years ago, they believed the case most likely would have been dropped if the target were a lesser-known person -- because the gun had not been used in a crime and Biden had taken steps to get and stay sober, according to a former law enforcement official familiar with the situation.\n\nGun rights activists argue that prosecuting substance abusers for buying or owning guns -- especially those, like Hunter Biden, who claim to be sober for long periods of time -- violates the Second Amendment right to bear arms.\n\nThere have been calls in recent years to alter or remove the drug question from the federal firearms application, especially when it comes to marijuana use, but Congress has not amended federal firearms or drug laws, and federal officials have not weakened their regulations.\n\nIn May, the ATF held firm on that position, warning cannabis users in Minnesota that they were banned from buying guns or ammunition despite the state's easing of marijuana restrictions.\n\nBut a 2022 Supreme Court ruling has spawned an all-fronts effort by gun rights advocates to roll back federal gun laws. The case, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, vastly expanded people's right to arm themselves in public.\n\nOne case Biden's team has cited is a challenge to the criteria used in the federal firearms background check system, pending before the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which includes Delaware.\n\nIf that lawsuit succeeds, it could undermine the legal foundation of his prosecution. If the court finds that it is unconstitutional to base an illegal firearm possession charge on a violation of the law banning sales to people who have been addicted to drugs, the two other charges lodged against Biden -- making false claims about drug use to obtain the gun -- would likely collapse too, said Andrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor and FBI official.", "source": {"uri":

Alvin Bragg's prosecution of former President Donald Trump -- because these legal proceedings involve Hunter Biden.\n\nWhile Hunter isn't on the same level as former President Trump, he is still the son of the current president and therefore his gun trial should garner a lot of attention and it probably would if ABC, CBS, NBC weren't so in the tank for Team Biden.\n\nIf their refusal to cover any of the recent Biden family scandals is a guide, don't expect ABC, CBS, NBC to plaster their evening and morning shows with reports on Hunter Biden's gun trial.\n\nThe following are five brand new Biden family scandals (from the last three months) that ABC, CBS, NBC refused to report:\n\nOn May 27, the New York Post reported:\n\nHunter Biden used his dad's appearance at a Sandy Hook shooting memorial event to coordinate a previously unknown planned meeting between the former vice president and a Chinese business partner, newly unveiled texts showed.\n\nOn Dec. 12, 2017, Hunter messaged CEFC executive Liu Yadong on WeChat to arrange a meeting with his powerful dad, documents released this week by the House Ways and Means Committee revealed.\n\n\"Can you meet this evening early,\" Hunter wrote in the messages obtained by IRS investigators. \"My father will be in New York also and he wants me to attend the Sandyhook [sic] memorial service with him and I would like him to meet you along with my uncle [Jim Biden] and then you and I can talk let me know if that works.\" \"No problem,\" Liu replied. \"Pls let me know where and when to meet.\"\n\nJoe Biden was later pictured at the Plaza Hotel for the event commemorating five years since the deadly Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. It was not immediately clear if Biden and Liu actually met that night.\n\nDespite repeatedly insisting his family earned no money from China, the president featured prominently in first son Hunter and first brother James Biden's multimillion-dollar relationship with CEFC, with most of his known alleged interactions happening in 2017 shortly after he left office as vice president. Joe Biden played a similar supporting role in Hunter's dealings with Chinese state-backed fund BHR Partners, which was registered just days after the father-son duo landed in Beijing aboard Air Force Two in 2013.\n\nThe newly revealed texts between Hunter Biden and Liu came after several months of back-and-forth over the Biden clan's involvement in a deal with CEFC - which has ties to the Chinese government - in exchange for a cool $10 million per year.\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee voted Wednesday to release 100 pages of new evidence that shows Hunter Biden lied under oath to Congress during his Feb. 28 deposition.\n\nThe evidence, provided by IRS whistleblowers Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler, who probed the first son's finances, reveals Hunter \"indisputably\" lied at least three times during his sworn testimony, the panel's majority said after voting in a closed-door executive session for its release.\n\nHunter, 54, claimed he was \"high or drunk\" when he sent a threatening text message to the wrong Chinese business associate -- but phone records of the WhatsApp message show the associate, Raymond Zhao, responded and \"knew exactly\" what the president's son was talking about when he asked to speak with the chairman of CEFC China Energy, Ye Jianming.\n\n\"Sure. I need some time to reach him,\" Zhao, a translator for CEFC, wrote back in messages over the next day. \"CEFC is willing to cooperate with the family.\"\n\nThe first son also kept exchanging messages with Zhao after making the threat that he was \"sitting\" with his father, Joe Biden, and said they would both \"hold a grudge\" if the CEFC translator reneged on a \"commitment.\"\n\n...\n\nZiegler also provided documents to the committee showing that Hunter signed off on and was the \"beneficial owner\" of a Rosemont Seneca Bohai bank account -- despite his testimony that it was not \"under my control nor affiliated with me\" and he \"didn't even know that there was such a thing\" as a corporate secretary of an entity.\n\n\"I, Robert Hunter Biden, hereby certify that I am the duly elected, qualified and acting Secretary of Rosemont Seneca Bohai, LLC,\" reads the signed April 29, 2014, document, which allowed the first son to enter into a contract with Porsche Financial Services.\n\nHunter also falsely denied that he would help his associates with \"any work as it related to visas that they needed\" or \"pick up the phone and call anybody for a visa.\"\n\nIn fact, a Feb. 5, 2015, email obtained by Ways and Means show Hunter, his ex-business partner Devon Archer and other associates trying to secure a visa for the founder of the Ukrainian gas firm Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky. \"Hunter is checking with Miguel Aleman to see if he can provide cover to Kola on the visa,\" Archer wrote in the email, before adding to Burisma associate Vadym Pozharskyi: \"please send Hunter an email with all Kola's passport and visa documents and evidence and copy me. We'll take it from there.\"\n\n\"Hunter Biden has shown once again he believes there are two systems of justice in this country -- one for his family, and one for everyone else,\" said House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith (R-Mo.) in a statement. \"Not only did Hunter Biden refuse to comply with his initial subpoena until threatened with criminal contempt, but he then came before Congress and lied.\"\n\nIndicted first son Hunter Biden suggested in a new interview that he didn't introduce his father to an executive from a Ukrainian gas company that was paying Hunter a million-dollar salary -- despite testifying to Congress that then-Vice President Joe Biden dined with the very same Burisma Holdings executive.\n\nThe 54-year-old brazenly backpedaled days after a fresh report that \"sugar brother\" Kevin Morris, who has bankrolled Hunter since meeting him at a presidential campaign fundraiser in late 2019, is \"completely tapped out\" after giving or loaning the scandal-plagued Biden at least $4.9 million.\n\nPresident Biden's son told The Daily Beast that lewd photos from his abandoned laptop, which also contained documents linking his dad to foreign business relationships, show \"someone in the throes of addiction\" and have been used to bolster the case that his business dealings were improper.\n\n\"You know, 'Here's this degenerate. And we can show you in vivid detail the level of his degeneracy. And here's him smoking a crack pipe. And here's him naked in a bathtub... Oh, and by the way, here's an email from Vadym [Pozharskyi] thanking him for introducing him to his dad,'\" Hunter told the outlet. \"Now, none of the second part is true. But they've made it a hell of a lot easier for people to believe.\"\n\nHunter indicated he did not introduce the Burisma board adviser to his father despite testifying on Feb. 28 that then-VP Biden attended a pair of dinners at DC's Cafe Milano restaurant in 2014 and 2015 -- one of which included Pozharskyi, whose company hired Hunter in early 2014 as his dad assumed control of the Obama administration's policy toward Ukraine. \"I do believe that Vadym was at one of these dinners, yes,\" Hunter told Congress, backing The Post's initial October 2020 reporting on documents from Hunter's abandoned laptop.\n\nThe Post's scoop was initially censored by Facebook and Twitter as the Biden campaign gave the impression it was denying the reporting, which described a thank-you email from Pozharskyi one day after the April 16, 2015, meal at Cafe Milano.\n\nEmails show Hunter planned for the dinner, which included other foreign patrons, to be \"ostensibly\" about his role on the board of the World Food Program USA charity.\n\nNew details about Jim Biden's foreign fundraising efforts are spilling out in a Kentucky bankruptcy court, where recent testimony indicates that President Joe Biden's brother partnered with Qatari government officials in his quest to find money for U.S. health care ventures.\n\nThe sworn testimony by fund manager Michael Lewitt, a former business partner of Jim Biden's, attests that two companies that facilitated the efforts were part-owned by \"members of the Qatari government.\"\n\nOne company named in the testimony partnered directly with Jim Biden in the multi-year fundraising efforts. The second company provided financial backing for a series of loans that a hospital chain paid Jim Biden to arrange, according to documents and testimony Lewitt submitted in the course of the federal bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nIf substantiated, the alleged arrangements would constitute some of the closest known financial links between a relative of President Joe Biden and a foreign government.\n\nThe alleged arrangements stem from an effort by Jim Biden to raise money from Qatari sources for ventures in the U.S. beginning in the months after his older brother left the vice presidency. At the time, the tiny, gas-rich nation faced a financial blockade from its neighbors and was spending lavishly to shore up its political standing in the West.\n\nPublic records and emails obtained by POLITICO offer a window on fundraising efforts in which Jim Biden invoked his ties to older brother and sought workarounds to restrictions on international money movements. Transactions related to the efforts are also at the heart of a recently-settled fraud case brought by the SEC and are being scrutinized as part of a federal criminal investigation in South Florida.\n\nMuch about the efforts remains unknown, and the White House, the Qatari Embassy, and a representative for Jim Biden all did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\nThe CIA blocked federal investigators from interviewing Hunter Biden's \"sugar brother\" Kevin Morris during a five-year probe into the first son's alleged tax crimes, a whistleblower has told House impeachment leaders.\n\nHouse Oversight and Judiciary Committee chairmen say the whistleblower informed them the intelligence agency stopped IRS and Justice Department investigators from interviewing Morris in August 2021, a Hollywood lawyer and patron of the first son, according to a Thursday letter addressed to CIA Director William Burns.\n\nThe whistleblower informed Oversight chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) and Judiciary chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) that two DOJ officials were summoned to CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. -- and told Morris \"could not be a witness\" for their investigation into Hunter Biden.\n\n\"It is unknown why or on what basis the CIA allegedly intervened to prevent investigators from interviewing Mr. Morris,\" Comer and Jordan wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The Post. \"However, these allegations track with other evidence showing how the DOJ deviated from its standard investigative practices during the investigation of Hunter Biden.\"\n\nThe Republican lawmakers added that the account \"seems to corroborate our concerns about DOJ's deviations from standard process to provide Hunter Biden with preferential treatment,\" which have been unearthed as evidence during their impeachment inquiry into his father, President Biden.", "source": {"uri": "newsbusters.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://newsbusters.org/"}, "authors": [],

The judge also plans to ask them if their views on the 2024 election would affect their impartiality and if they believe Biden being the son of a president has caused him to be prosecuted more or less than what is fair.\n\nThe day before the trial, Noreika dealt blows to Biden's defense team, including denying his request to allow one of his expert witnesses, a psychiatrist, to testify about drug addiction, according to court orders.\n\nBiden's attorneys had wanted the doctor to testify that addicts commonly are in a \"state of denial\" about their addiction, which would help them argue Biden thought that when he allegedly said on the gun form that he was not an illegal drug user, he was being truthful.\n\nWeiss has indicated he plans to introduce evidence at trial that shows investigators tested a leather gun pouch they retrieved in 2018 for drugs and found evidence of cocaine on it.\n\nFor a second expert witness, Biden's attorneys asked to call a toxicologist to the stand to dispute the chain of command of the pouch. They said they expect the witness to testify that the drug test was performed five years after the pouch was obtained and that the test included no dating information. Noreika said she would reserve judgment on whether to allow the witness to testify.\n\nNoreika also denied Biden's attorney's request to permit evidence of a second version of the gun form Biden allegedly filled out that included updated information on it. The attorneys planned to incorporate the form into their defense by saying the second form on record with the gun shop was \"doctored.\" The judge called this \"unsupported rhetoric.\"\n\nThe trial is also expected to be highly personal for Biden, as prosecutors have said they plan to call his ex-wife and two ex-girlfriends to the stand to serve as witnesses to his alleged drug abuse in 2018.\n\nThe prosecutors also said they will present excerpts from Biden's memoir Beautiful Things, in which the first son vividly detailed how he battled for years with an addiction to crack.\n\nBiden, who said he became sober in 2019, has pleaded not guilty to three gun charges he is facing. If convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though receiving the maximum penalty is highly unlikely.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nBiden also attempted to have his case dismissed on several grounds, including that a Supreme Court ruling in recent years that relaxed gun regulations rendered the charges unconstitutional. Noreika denied the request but said he could raise it again after the trial.\n\nWhile his father has, as president, advocated stricter gun laws, the first son's case is one gun rights activists see as an opportunity to shape gun regulation in their favor.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_oliver@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Ashley Oliver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryellen_Noreika", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maryellen Noreika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revolver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Second Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_witness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Expert witness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_hierarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Command hierarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toxicology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drug test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_possession_of_a_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal possession of a weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gun politics in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Airsoft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Airsoft", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24145650700943-1.jpg.optimal.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Alvin Bragg's prosecution of former President Donald Trump -- because these legal proceedings involve Hunter Biden.\n\nWhile Hunter isn't on the same level as former President Trump, he is still the son of the current president and therefore his gun trial should garner a lot of attention and it probably would if ABC, CBS, NBC weren't so in the tank for Team Biden.\n\nIf their refusal to cover any of the recent Biden family scandals is a guide, don't expect ABC, CBS, NBC to plaster their evening and morning shows with reports on Hunter Biden's gun trial.\n\nThe following are five brand new Biden family scandals (from the last three months) that ABC, CBS, NBC refused to report:\n\nDocuments Show Hunter Used Sandy Hook Memorial to Set Up a Meeting Between Joe and Chinese Business Partner\n\nOn May 27, the New York Post reported:\n\nHunter Biden used his dad's appearance at a Sandy Hook shooting memorial event to coordinate a previously unknown planned meeting between the former vice president and a Chinese business partner, newly unveiled texts showed.\n\nOn Dec. 12, 2017, Hunter messaged CEFC executive Liu Yadong on WeChat to arrange a meeting with his powerful dad, documents released this week by the House Ways and Means Committee revealed.\n\n\"Can you meet this evening early,\" Hunter wrote in the messages obtained by IRS investigators. \"My father will be in New York also and he wants me to attend the Sandyhook [sic] memorial service with him and I would like him to meet you along with my uncle [Jim Biden] and then you and I can talk let me know if that works.\" \"No problem,\" Liu replied. \"Pls let me know where and when to meet.\"\n\nJoe Biden was later pictured at the Plaza Hotel for the event commemorating five years since the deadly Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. It was not immediately clear if Biden and Liu actually met that night.\n\nDespite repeatedly insisting his family earned no money from China, the president featured prominently in first son Hunter and first brother James Biden's multimillion-dollar relationship with CEFC, with most of his known alleged interactions happening in 2017 shortly after he left office as vice president. Joe Biden played a similar supporting role in Hunter's dealings with Chinese state-backed fund BHR Partners, which was registered just days after the father-son duo landed in Beijing aboard Air Force Two in 2013.\n\nThe newly revealed texts between Hunter Biden and Liu came after several months of back-and-forth over the Biden clan's involvement in a deal with CEFC - which has ties to the Chinese government - in exchange for a cool $10 million per year.\n\nABC, CBS, NBC evening and morning show coverage: 0 seconds.\n\nHouse Votes to Release Evidence That Proves Hunter \"Indisputably\" Lied Under Oath\n\nOn May 22, the New York Post reported:\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee voted Wednesday to release 100 pages of new evidence that shows Hunter Biden lied under oath to Congress during his Feb. 28 deposition.\n\nThe evidence, provided by IRS whistleblowers Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler, who probed the first son's finances, reveals Hunter \"indisputably\" lied at least three times during his sworn testimony, the panel's majority said after voting in a closed-door executive session for its release.\n\nHunter, 54, claimed he was \"high or drunk\" when he sent a threatening text message to the wrong Chinese business associate -- but phone records of the WhatsApp message show the associate, Raymond Zhao, responded and \"knew exactly\" what the president's son was talking about when he asked to speak with the chairman of CEFC China Energy, Ye Jianming.\n\n\"Sure. I need some time to reach him,\" Zhao, a translator for CEFC, wrote back in messages over the next day. \"CEFC is willing to cooperate with the family.\"\n\nThe first son also kept exchanging messages with Zhao after making the threat that he was \"sitting\" with his father, Joe Biden, and said they would both \"hold a grudge\" if the CEFC translator reneged on a \"commitment.\"\n\n...\n\nZiegler also provided documents to the committee showing that Hunter signed off on and was the \"beneficial owner\" of a Rosemont Seneca Bohai bank account -- despite his testimony that it was not \"under my control nor affiliated with me\" and he \"didn't even know that there was such a thing\" as a corporate secretary of an entity.\n\n\"I, Robert Hunter Biden, hereby certify that I am the duly elected, qualified and acting Secretary of Rosemont Seneca Bohai, LLC,\" reads the signed April 29, 2014, document, which allowed the first son to enter into a contract with Porsche Financial Services.\n\nHunter also falsely denied that he would help his associates with \"any work as it related to visas that they needed\" or \"pick up the phone and call anybody for a visa.\"\n\nIn fact, a Feb. 5, 2015, email obtained by Ways and Means show Hunter, his ex-business partner Devon Archer and other associates trying to secure a visa for the founder of the Ukrainian gas firm Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky. \"Hunter is checking with Miguel Aleman to see if he can provide cover to Kola on the visa,\" Archer wrote in the email, before adding to Burisma associate Vadym Pozharskyi: \"please send Hunter an email with all Kola's passport and visa documents and evidence and copy me. We'll take it from there.\"\n\n\"Hunter Biden has shown once again he believes there are two systems of justice in this country -- one for his family, and one for everyone else,\" said House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith (R-Mo.) in a statement. \"Not only did Hunter Biden refuse to comply with his initial subpoena until threatened with criminal contempt, but he then came before Congress and lied.\"\n\nABC, CBS, NBC evening and morning show coverage: 0 seconds.\n\nHunter Claims He Never Introduced Dad to Burisma Exec, Despite Them All Having Dinner Together\n\nOn May 20, the New York Post reported:\n\nIndicted first son Hunter Biden suggested in a new interview that he didn't introduce his father to an executive from a Ukrainian gas company that was paying Hunter a million-dollar salary -- despite testifying to Congress that then-Vice President Joe Biden dined with the very same Burisma Holdings executive.\n\nThe 54-year-old brazenly backpedaled days after a fresh report that \"sugar brother\" Kevin Morris, who has bankrolled Hunter since meeting him at a presidential campaign fundraiser in late 2019, is \"completely tapped out\" after giving or loaning the scandal-plagued Biden at least $4.9 million.\n\nPresident Biden's son told The Daily Beast that lewd photos from his abandoned laptop, which also contained documents linking his dad to foreign business relationships, show \"someone in the throes of addiction\" and have been used to bolster the case that his business dealings were improper.\n\n\"You know, 'Here's this degenerate. And we can show you in vivid detail the level of his degeneracy. And here's him smoking a crack pipe. And here's him naked in a bathtub... Oh, and by the way, here's an email from Vadym [Pozharskyi] thanking him for introducing him to his dad,'\" Hunter told the outlet. \"Now, none of the second part is true. But they've made it a hell of a lot easier for people to believe.\"\n\nHunter indicated he did not introduce the Burisma board adviser to his father despite testifying on Feb. 28 that then-VP Biden attended a pair of dinners at DC's Cafe Milano restaurant in 2014 and 2015 -- one of which included Pozharskyi, whose company hired Hunter in early 2014 as his dad assumed control of the Obama administration's policy toward Ukraine. \"I do believe that Vadym was at one of these dinners, yes,\" Hunter told Congress, backing The Post's initial October 2020 reporting on documents from Hunter's abandoned laptop.\n\nThe Post's scoop was initially censored by Facebook and Twitter as the Biden campaign gave the impression it was denying the reporting, which described a thank-you email from Pozharskyi one day after the April 16, 2015, meal at Cafe Milano.\n\nEmails show Hunter planned for the dinner, which included other foreign patrons, to be \"ostensibly\" about his role on the board of the World Food Program USA charity.\n\nABC, CBS, NBC evening and morning show coverage: 0 seconds.\n\nFund Manager Claims Jim Biden Had Business Relationship with Qatari Officials, Would Be Closest Link Between a Biden Family Member and Foreign Government\n\nOn April 28, Politico reported:\n\nNew details about Jim Biden's foreign fundraising efforts are spilling out in a Kentucky bankruptcy court, where recent testimony indicates that President Joe Biden's brother partnered with Qatari government officials in his quest to find money for U.S. health care ventures.\n\nThe sworn testimony by fund manager Michael Lewitt, a former business partner of Jim Biden's, attests that two companies that facilitated the efforts were part-owned by \"members of the Qatari government.\"\n\nOne company named in the testimony partnered directly with Jim Biden in the multi-year fundraising efforts. The second company provided financial backing for a series of loans that a hospital chain paid Jim Biden to arrange, according to documents and testimony Lewitt submitted in the course of the federal bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nIf substantiated, the alleged arrangements would constitute some of the closest known financial links between a relative of President Joe Biden and a foreign government.\n\nThe alleged arrangements stem from an effort by Jim Biden to raise money from Qatari sources for ventures in the U.S. beginning in the months after his older brother left the vice presidency. At the time, the tiny, gas-rich nation faced a financial blockade from its neighbors and was spending lavishly to shore up its political standing in the West.\n\nPublic records and emails obtained by POLITICO offer a window on fundraising efforts in which Jim Biden invoked his ties to older brother and sought workarounds to restrictions on international money movements. Transactions related to the efforts are also at the heart of a recently-settled fraud case brought by the SEC and are being scrutinized as part of a federal criminal investigation in South Florida.\n\nMuch about the efforts remains unknown, and the White House, the Qatari Embassy, and a representative for Jim Biden all did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\nABC, CBS, NBC evening and morning show coverage: 0 seconds.\n\nCIA Blocked Hunter's \"Sugar Brother\" Attorney Friend From Being Interviewed by Feds\n\nThe CIA blocked federal investigators from interviewing Hunter Biden's \"sugar brother\" Kevin Morris during a five-year probe into the first son's alleged tax crimes, a whistleblower has told House impeachment leaders.\n\nHouse Oversight and Judiciary Committee chairmen say the whistleblower informed them the intelligence agency stopped IRS and Justice Department investigators from interviewing Morris in August 2021, a Hollywood lawyer and patron of the first son, according to a Thursday letter addressed to CIA Director William Burns.\n\nThe whistleblower informed Oversight chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) and Judiciary chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) that two DOJ officials were summoned to CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. -- and told Morris \"could not be a witness\" for their investigation into Hunter Biden.\n\n\"It is unknown why or on what basis the CIA allegedly intervened to prevent investigators from interviewing Mr. Morris,\" Comer and Jordan wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The Post. \"However, these allegations track with other evidence showing how the DOJ deviated from its standard investigative practices during the investigation of Hunter Biden.\"\n\nThe Republican lawmakers added that the account \"seems to corroborate our concerns about DOJ's deviations from standard process to provide Hunter Biden with preferential treatment,\" which have been unearthed as evidence during their impeachment inquiry into his father, President Biden.\n\nABC, CBS, NBC evening and morning show coverage: 0 seconds.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"},

In exchange, prosecutors would not charge him with a gun possession violation.\n\nBut, in a dramatic moment in court, the judge refused to accept the scope of the plea deal, and the agreement - which was slammed as a \"sweetheart deal\" by critics of President Joe Biden - fell apart.\n\nSpecial counsel David Weiss first brought the three gun-related charges in September, before hitting him with nine tax-related criminal charges three months later.\n\nBiden's attorneys have argued that the charges against the president's son are the result of Republican pressure in a bid to damage his father's reelection campaign.\n\nThis trial marks the first of two criminal trials the president's son faces this summer with his tax fraud trial slated to begin on 20 June in California.\n\nIn that case, prosecutors allege that Biden made millions of dollars in income between the years 2016 and 2020 and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle of \"exotic cars\", \"drugs, escorts and girlfriends\" - all the while skipping out on more than $1.4m in taxes.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Hunter \"engaged in a four-year scheme to not pay at least $1.4 million in self-assessed federal taxes he owed for tax years 2016 through 2019, from in or about January 2017 through in or about October 15, 2020, and to evade the assessment of taxes for tax year 2018 when he filed false returns in or about February 2020\".\n\nInstead of paying his tax bills, the president's son allegedly spent millions of dollars funding his \"extravagant lifestyle\", including spending money on \"drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing, and other items of a personal nature\".\n\n\"In short, everything but his taxes,\" the indictment states.\n\nThe president's son has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nIn April, a federal judge threw out his bid to dismiss a string of tax charges, based on the argument that Weiss brought the charges due to pressure from the president's Republican critics.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type":

But here at the Daily Caller, we're nothing if not slaves to the truth, so it's well past time to clear up the record: Joe Biden is a shitty dad.\n\nThere's only one approved way to think about the Biden family drama. It's alright to admit that Hunter Biden is a mess -- a drug addict and serial philanderer who, to varying degrees depending on whom you ask, took advantage of his father's powerful position for personal gain. But even Republicans won't challenge the underlying assertion that Biden was always just a devoted father, sadly powerless to help his beloved son.\n\nNow, in his heart of hearts, the president does love his son. \"It's dad, I called to tell you I love you,\" says a distraught Biden in a leaked voicemail on Hunter's phone. \"You gotta get some help, I don't know what to do.\" But this was in 2018, after Biden had already done all the wrong things. He might love his son, but the record suggests he loves money and power so much more.\n\nLet's step back to the waning days of the Obama-Biden administration. Barack Obama was on his way out of the White House, but his control over the Democratic Party had never been stronger. He spent eight years staffing the federal government with bureaucrats who worshiped the ground he walked on and built a quasi-religious movement around himself as the embodiment of hope and change. The party's platform reoriented beneath him, embracing his then-radical politics and taking it mainstream.\n\nThe one man who did not fit into the new paradigm was the aging, white Pennsylvanian who once worried about his children growing up \"in a racial jungle.\" Joe Biden was a useful vice presidential pick because he brought along the old blue dog Democratic base to complement Obama's enthusiastic, but insufficient, coalition of minorities and young, affluent city dwellers. But when this \"coalition of the ascendant\" proved dominant in 2012, Democrats felt they could abandon the \"bitter clingers\" for good. Scranton Joe had finally outlived his usefulness.\n\nIf there's one thing Biden's been good at over a fifty year career, it's reading the political winds. Obama reportedly encouraged him not to make a presidential bid against Hillary Clinton, as even Biden himself acknowledged in a 2017 memoir. Clinton was, after all, the \"most qualified candidate ever,\" according to Obama. So after months of speculation, Biden finally announced in October 2015 that he would not be running for president -- with the understanding this meant the end of his political career. The question for Biden then became: how to maintain the lifestyle he had grown accustomed to and not just fade into post-political obscurity?\n\nHe was a milquetoast political servant with no real skills or accomplishments to speak of. There would be no 7-figure speaking fees in his future. Neither could he be very useful in the private sector. No, his back up plan would have to be the same as every other political has-been -- the soft foreign influence peddling that's been Washington's worst-kept secret for decades.\n\nIt is likely no coincidence that at the time Biden believed his political career was winding down that Hunter's foreign business entanglements kicked into high gear. The first big payout came in February 2014, when Hunter's firm Rosemont Seneca received $3.5 million from Russian oligarch Yelena Baturina. In spring of that year, Hunter then joined Ukrainian energy firm Burisma's board of directors at a salary of $1 million per year. He spent the next year fostering relationships with businessmen from Kazakhstan and Romania. By the time Biden announced he would not be running for president, Hunter had already begun a relationship with Chinese infrastructure company CEFC. That relationship would eventually pay out over $8 million to the Biden family and their associates by 2017. (RELATED: Hunter Biden's Latest Legal Allegation Could Be 'Very Bad' For American Journalism, Analysts Say)\n\nFrom phone logs and bank records to GPS data, there is now a mountain of circumstantial evidence tying Joe Biden to his son's foreign business dealings. It is almost impossible to imagine that Hunter's scheming happened without the express knowledge and consent of his father. In all likelihood, however, it went a step further: knowing he stood at the edge of oblivion, Joe likely instructed Hunter to secure the family's future. But if you are a loving, devoted father, this is the last thing you would do to your child.\n\nJoe Biden has had a famously tragic life. His first wife and daughter died in a car accident in 1972. His son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015. Reeling from \"overwhelming grief,\" Hunter -- with a decades-long history of alcoholism and cocaine addiction -- has admitted to relapsing after his elder brother's death. Rather than support his last living son as his demons re-emerged, he sent him into the belly of the beast.\n\nTo help \"the family,\" Hunter had to cavort with some of the world's shadiest oligarchs and became a toy for them to placate and pamper. They plied him with untold amounts of booze, drugs, and whatever other forms of degeneracy just to have their way with his father. The former Soviet bloc is known for drug smuggling, underage sex workers, and unregulated nightlife. How many Eastern European hookers did Hunter smoke crack with in the late 2010s -- one hundred, one thousand, more? Biden not only sacrificed his patriotism by selling the appearance of influence, but he sacrificed his son the precise moment he was at his most vulnerable.\n\nAnd for what? A few million dollars to buy some creature comfort in his twilight years. It may sound like a lot of money, but the grand total is still less than what Obama can casually bring in from a few speeches and a Netflix movie. Biden cannot claim to be doing this for the good of \"the family.\" These silver coins will not support his many grandchildren for long -- and he irreparably destroyed his son in the process. (RELATED: Here's All The Evidence Connecting Joe Biden To Hunter Biden's Foreign Business Dealings)\n\nThere's no question about it: a good father would sacrifice his own wealth and comfort to save his son. He would fly to Kazakhstan, or Russia, or any godforsaken shithole on the planet, and drag him kicking and screaming back to America for detox and rehab. It is not uncommon for parents with far fewer resources than the Bidens to skimp and sacrifice to put together $50,000 for life saving rehab. Biden, with all his power, money, and resources, could have gotten the best help in the world for Hunter. He chose not to.\n\nBiden almost achieved his soft landing. In all likelihood, Hunter would have partied his way into the grave, and Biden would have enjoyed a comfortable retirement on a private beach somewhere -- if not for two unforeseen developments. First, Donald Trump rocketed to power on a wave of resentment against progressive arrogance, making genteel Joe useful again to the Democratic Party machine. Then, the railroading of President Trump led to a renewed interest in FARA violations. When Biden was thrust back into the spotlight as the best candidate to take on Trump in 2020, it was only a matter before Hunter's demons would come under scrutiny.\n\nKnowing this, Biden could have bowed out gracefully. He could have resisted the call back to the political world, knowing it would cause acute stress for Hunter -- who was then just beginning to recover from his relapse -- by putting his life under a microscope. But he didn't. After decades of failed presidential bids, he could not resist his will to power, and he once again sacrificed his son in its pursuit.\n\nSo when the media says that Hunter Biden is a victim, in a way, they're right. He's not a victim of Republican inquisitors, who cannot be expected to overlook his immoral and illegal behavior just because of his unfortunate circumstances. Neither is he a victim of his addiction, despite the hell it put him through. What he is is a victim of his own father, whose greed and narcissism enabled him to become the worst man he could be.\n\nContrary to the Washington consensus, Joe Biden has never been a good dad trying and failing to help his son. He has already destroyed his son's life twice. With the walls closing in as we head into a tight election year, he can be counted on to do it once again. Hunter will be facing a whole new level of scrutiny as his gun trial begins; Joe's safest political path forward is to allow him to fall on his sword.", "source": {"uri": "dailycaller.com",

He will become the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be criminally tried when jury selection begins on Monday.\n\nCourt filings submitted by Hunter Biden's legal team indicate that the defense intends to question the quality of the prosecution's evidence and argue that the president's son was not using illegal drugs at the time of his gun purchase, while also questioning the language used on the federal form.\n\nWhile buying a gun, Biden allegedly declared that he was not a drug addict, something prosecutors say is a felony, given Biden's extensive drug history.\n\nBiden had filed a motion to seek an almost identical gun purchase form to be admitted into evidence into the trial, while claiming that law enforcement was trying to doctor forms to incriminate him.\n\nIn Sunday's ruling, Noreika also strongly rejected Biden's claim that the gun shop owner's past Republican beliefs should be known to the jury.\n\n\"The Court agrees with the government that the political views expressed in 2020 by the gun shop owner, Palimere...are sideshows aimed at tainting or confusing the jury,\" she wrote.\n\nShe also noted that Palimere did not witness Biden filling out the gun ownership application.\n\nNoreika also wrote that Biden was trying to create confusion about the gun ownership form he filled out.\n\n\"The government has stated that it intends to call Gordon Cleveland, a gun shop employee, who will testify that he watched Defendant fill out Section A of the Certified Form and that Defendant checked 'no' to question 11e about being an unlawful user or addict,\" she noted.\n\nThe only difference between that and another, very similar form that Biden wants to admit in evidence, is that the second form notes that Biden's car is registered in Delaware.\n\n\"The Court also agrees with the government that Defendant's conspiratorial theory about 'doctored' forms and currying favor with the government is unsupported rhetoric, which would be prejudicial and confusing to the jury,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Such questioning, testimony, evidence or argument is not relevant, is unduly prejudicial and invites nullification.\"\n\nNullification occurs

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Monday, June 3rd, 2024. This is The Excerpt.\n\nToday, Mexico has elected a new president. Plus, we take a look at Hunter Biden's gun trial which is set to begin today. And is corporate America keeping promises it made to Black Americans?\n\n\u2666\n\nMexicans have elected their first woman president. Claudia Sheinbaum received between 58.3 and 60.7% of the vote according to preliminary results announced by Mexico's National Electoral Institute earlier today. On October 1st, she'll become the leader of a country that is the top trade partner of the US and the second-largest economy of Latin America. She'll also be overseeing a country slammed by violence tied to organized crime. With Sheinbaum's win, Mexico beat the United States in electing a female head of state. Sheinbaum is a scientist, engineer, and former mayor of Mexico City who shares the populist ideology of her political mentor, outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. For more on what's next across the border, check out our Saturday episode of The Excerpt when I spoke with USA TODAY national reporter Lauren Villagran who put the election in context for us. You can find a link to that episode in today's show notes.\n\n\u2666\n\nHunter Biden's felony gun trial is set to begin today following the collapse of a deal with federal investigators last year. I spoke with USA TODAY Justice Department correspondent Bart Jansen for a look ahead. Bart, thanks for hopping on.\n\nSo Bart, the build-up to this trial has really been kind of start, stop, start, stop for months. What's that issue here and what's happened leading up to this week?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThe government had tried to reach a plea agreement with Hunter Biden last July to resolve its multi-year investigation of tax and gun complaints, and it envisioned him pleading guilty to a couple of misdemeanors for tax charges and then getting put into a pretrial diversion program over gun charges so that if he completed the program, which meant two years of sobriety and no other crimes committed, that he could have those charges wiped out entirely. So it looked like last July, he was going to be able to walk away without any jail time and resolve this lengthy investigation. Well, the plea negotiations fell apart and so the prosecutor David Weiss, who is the US Attorney in Delaware and he was later appointed to special counsel to pursue this investigation further, he indicted Hunter Biden on three felony gun charges in September. And those are the charges that are coming to trial today finally in Delaware. A second set of nine tax charges are scheduled for trial in California on September 5th.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo what can we actually expect today and the rest of this week?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nJury selection starts today. The trial overall is expected to last a couple of weeks. The charges against Hunter Biden focus on a form that he filled out where he was asked, \"Are you the unlawful user or addicted to marijuana, depressant, stimulants, or a narcotic drug or other controlled substance?\" And he marked an X on that page. But his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has suggested that he didn't know what the term addict or user meant at that time, and he had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and he was living with a sober companion so that he didn't view himself as a current user or addict.\n\nNow, that will be something for the jury to decide. Prosecutors have said that they want to use federal definitions of what is a user or an addict. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms says that a user or an addict is somebody who used a controlled substance within the past year or had multiple arrests during the past five years. So they take a much more expansive view. Hunter Biden's lawyers have tried to rule out that view and disputed whether the jury will be instructed to consider the charges in that way. And so that's one of the key points that we're going to be seeing in this trial.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBart, the timing here is interesting coming just days after former President Donald Trump was found guilty on all counts in his hush money trial, and half of Americans say they believe Hunter Biden received favorable treatment from prosecutors because he's the president's son. That's according to a Reuters Ipsos poll last summer. Bart, how are Americans viewing this trial in the wake of being so focused on the former president in recent weeks?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nWell, there's definitely a lot of skepticism about how Hunter Biden's investigation was handled because he is the son of the president. When the plea agreement was announced and the prospect of no jail time was revealed, House Republicans just blasted as a sweetheart deal. They said clearly he was giving favored treatment because he is the son of the president. Attorney General Merrick Garland has forcefully denied that. He said the investigation was carried out independently. They followed the facts and the law. And then as the plea agreement fell apart over basically a dispute between defense lawyers and prosecutors over whether Hunter Biden would be protected from potential future charges, ones that we don't even know about yet, when that deal fell apart, Garland named David Weiss, the US Attorney in Delaware, as a special counsel so he would have even more independence to pursue charges. And Weiss then came back two separate indictments, one dealing with gun charges and one dealing with tax charges.\n\nBut so then on the flip side, Democrats are now criticizing the investigation, saying that it has now become too harsh that the gun charges at stake about lying on the federal form about whether you are an addict are rarely prosecuted and that basically Hunter Biden is being prosecuted just because he is the president's son. And so it is almost flipped to the other side, the accusations that the trial is too harsh. So it is absolutely viewed through a political lens from both sides, and there'll be a lot of attention paid to how the trial goes because of the implications for potentially having the first presidential child convicted of a crime while the president is in office. That would be a first.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Bart Jansen covers the Justice Department for USA TODAY. Thanks, Bart.\n\nAs Pride Month begins this week, LGBTQ+ communities and allies around the country are taking steps to promote safety at Pride events. In Colorado, organizers at the Pikes Peak Pride Festival are making plans to mark the event's 34th anniversary in Colorado Springs where a gunman killed five and injured 25 at the LGBTQ+ nightclub, Club Q, in 2022. Pikes Peak Pride board member Justin Burns said, \"The importance of Pride and celebrating our identity is more important than any fear.\" At a time of continuing anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and a spate of legislative measures targeting the trans community, LGBTQ+ groups and their advocates say it's more important than ever to maintain a proud sense of identity while remaining vigilant in the face of unknown threats.\n\nLast month, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued a public service announcement to raise awareness of the potential targeting of LGBTQIA+ events like Pride by foreign terrorist organizations or their supporters. One national group hopes to provide the community a sense of security by training faith leaders and congregants to play a protective and calming role at Pride events around the country. Interfaith Alliance, an organization that promotes LGBTQ+ rights and inclusive faith communities, teamed with the Southern Poverty Law Center to offer the training as part of its third annual Faith for Pride initiative. You can read more about steps being taken to keep Pride safe this month with a link in today's show notes.\n\n\u2666\n\nAn estimated 5.4 million children provided care to parents, grandparents, or siblings with chronic medical conditions or functional decline in 2019. That was up from just over a million in 2005 according to reports from the National Alliance for Caregiving and others. An aging population, more drug and alcohol use, mental health issues, shorter hospital stays, and long COVID have likely boosted the need for kids to help in the home according to experts. And in-home care and nursing homes are hard to find and unaffordable for most, especially if you're still relatively young.\n\nPresident Joe Biden took executive action last year to expand care and raise wages, but none of them help youth caregivers. Other countries, including the UK and Australia, recognize young carers through legislation and policy and offer stipends. In the US, Medicare does not pay family members to provide care, and low income families on Medicaid can only get reimbursement for adults. Experts say help for now is left to nonprofits.\n\n\u2666\n\nAmid an anti-DEI backlash, is corporate America keeping the promises it made to Black Americans after George Floyd's murder? I spoke with USA TODAY senior reporter Jessica Guynn for more. Jessica, thanks for hopping on.\n\nSo Jessica, what did companies promise when it comes to diversity in the wake of George Floyd's murder?\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nWell, four years ago as a business journalist, I couldn't go a few minutes without a press release or a tweet from companies declaring that they were all in the fight against racial injustice and vowing to do their part after George Floyd's murder. And in these missives, they ponied up billions in financial commitments and they outlined pretty ambitious goals to make their workforces look more like America.\n\nFor the last 10 years at USA TODAY, I've been documenting the deep racial disparities in the nation's largest and most powerful companies. And these companies were certainly signaling that they were really ready to do something about it, but then they ran headlong into a conservative-led backlash that is hellbent on vilifying just the kind of diversity efforts that they were undertaking.\n\nThis what they call anti-woke movement gain momentum last year with the Supreme Court ruling that ended affirmative action in college admissions, and activists claim that DEI in the corporate world is handing women and people of color jobs and promotions at the expense of more qualified candidates. They also argue that corporate programs that exclude white people like a fellowship or an internship geared to racial minorities is just as illegal as a program that excludes Black people. What's more, there are now questions about the legality as some of these initiatives in the wake of that ruling, and that's put the business world on the defensive. They've began to scrutinize and walk back some policies and programs they adopted after Floyd was killed, such as hiring targets for Black executives. Critics say those hiring goals are illegal quotas in disguise.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo have Black workers made any gains since Floyd's murder?\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nBlack Americans are making headway, and we've established that in our own data investigations here at USA TODAY. For example, we reported last year that the nation's 100 largest companies had four Black CEOs and a growing number of top executives who were Black. But of course, that's just a small dent. Of the 533 top executive officers across these companies, white men were 7 in 10. And of those companies, about 1 in 7 had executive teams that were made up only of white men.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nJessica, DEI refers to diversity, equity, and inclusion. But what are some companies saying about shifting this conversation to refer to just the word inclusion instead?\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nWell, no one wants to be caught referring to DEI anymore. Companies are dropping that language from their shareholder reports and in earnings calls. Some companies are even listing DEI as a risk factor. Instead, increasingly we're seeing talk of inclusion, and that's an attempt to sidestep some of the controversy that's been created around DEI. The idea being that creating inclusive workplaces is less likely to get you in hot water with critics since you're stressing company initiatives that are for everyone, not just certain demographic groups.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nJessica Guynn is a senior reporter with USA TODAY. Thank you, Jessica.\n\nAnd a happy first week of June, listeners, the unofficial start to summer for many. Thanks for listening to The Excerpt. You can get the podcast wherever you get your pods.

The case is being brought by the Biden Justice Department, unlike the New York State case against Trump that MAGA says is being directed by Biden.\n\n2. The trial starting today is based on Hunter Biden's alleged unlawful possession of a firearm, under a very unusual set of facts, alleging that Hunter Biden failed to disclose his drug problem on the firearms application that MAGA doesn't think he should have had to fill out in the first place.\n\n3. Biden alleges that he was sober at the time of the application. One of the symptoms of addiction is denial of the addiction. About 100 million American adults report that either they or someone in their household owns a firearm, while about 47 million American adults and teenagers have battled a substance abuse problem in the past year. A prosecution for lying to the ATF on form 4473 occurred in fewer than 300 of the 27 million applications in 2019, one of which applications was Hunter Biden's.\n\n4. The conservative Supreme Court has chipped away at gun restrictions, asserting that such restrictions must be based in tradition. Biden used the precedent to seek dismissal of the charges, arguing that there is no tradition of such restriction, and the restriction is therefore unconstitutional. That motion was denied by Federal District Judge Maryellen Noreika, nominated to the bench by Donald Trump, and an Appeals Court declined to hear the appeal of that and other rulings of the Trump-appointed judge denying dismissal of the case on numerous grounds.\n\n5. A juror was disqualified today after reporting that he could not be fair and impartial. The juror, who fits the profile of a MAGA voter, said that he could not be impartial in a firearms case because he believes that the right to own a firearm comes from God.\n\nIn summary, the son of the president is being prosecuted by the Biden Justice Department for allegations most conservatives do not beleive should be a crime, before a Trump appointed judge, and jurors who are Trump supporters will likely be disqualified for their philosophical unwillingness to convict him.

The allegations in this case, which began jury selection Tuesday, throw the spotlight on the wider ramifications of presidential remarks on the American legal system.\n\nA .38-caliber Colt Cobra pistol that the younger Biden bought in 2018 is the subject of three criminal charges against him. He freely acknowledged that at the time of the purchase, he was struggling with a serious drug addiction. Two counts of lying on gun purchase documentation and one allegation of unlawful gun ownership had been filed against him.\n\nHunter Biden has resolutely denied these accusations, a position shared by his father, President Joe Biden, who has said in public that he believes his son is a recovered addict.\n\nAlthough it makes emotional sense for the US President to defend his son, it also highlights important concerns about the impact of his remarks on the American judiciary. One way to see it is as an attempt to influence public opinion and, inadvertently, the legal system itself when the head of state makes unambiguous claims regarding the innocence of an accused person.\n\nSuch claims made by an incumbent president have weight and may compromise the objectivity that is necessary for the legal system. Beyond the gun accusations, Hunter Biden has other legal issues. Separate charges against him include tax evasion in California and corruption in connection with his transactions in China and Ukraine.\n\nEven though he hasn't been charged with any offenses pertaining to his international businesses, the combined impact of these accusations has certainly clouded his father's reelection campaign.\n\nCentral to Hunter Biden's defense is the background of his addiction and supposed rehabilitation. According to his defense team, Biden was living with a sober friend and had just finished an 11-day recovery program when he bought the revolver.\n\nThey argue that -- crucial in determining whether he intentionally gave false information on the gun purchase application -- he did not regard himself as a current user or addict. This subtle debate draws attention to how complicated addiction and recovery are and how well the legal definitions match individual views and medical facts.\n\nBut the larger issue -- how can presidential remarks impact public and judicial perception -- remains, notwithstanding the defense's case. President Biden runs the danger of being perceived as a strong man trying to sway the outcome of justice, even as his claim of his son's innocence may be regarded as that of a loving father protecting his kid. For Americans, this is really troubling in a very divisive political climate when public confidence in institutions -- including the judiciary -- is already low.\n\nAs expected, Republicans have responded to Hunter Biden's legal problems by intensifying these accusations and frequently equating them with the legal problems of former President Donald Trump, who has just been found guilty of attempting to conceal alleged sex-related payments.\n\nRepublicans might be keen to turn the focus from Trump's legal problems on the Biden family's, using Hunter Biden's case as the central theme in their story of misbehavior and corruption in the Biden administration. The politicized and divisive character of American politics today is highlighted by this political tactic, which turns court cases into political maneuverings.\n\nBeyond the US, the Hunter Biden case provides a significant prism through which to look at the impact of presidential authority on the judiciary -- a worry that is shared in the Philippines as well. The Philippines has acquired a judicial system based on American ideas, stressing the rule of law and judicial independence, as a former US vassal. The same difficulties with public perception and political influence do, however, also arise.\n\nParticularly in well-publicized instances involving powerful people, the Philippine legal system has frequently come under fire for what is seen to be political meddling. The requirement of careful thought and moderation by those in authority to preserve the independence and integrity of the courts is highlighted by these dynamics.\n\nThough natural, President Joe Biden's public backing of his son highlights the careful balance needed to preserve judicial independence. Leadership in the Philippines may learn from this scenario and understand the possible effects of their public remarks on court cases. Retaining public confidence in the judiciary requires that all people be held to the same legal standards, irrespective of their political affiliation.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.net.ph",

Hunter Biden goes on trial today in Wilmington, Delaware, on gun charges in a case that could prove an embarrassment to his father, Joe Biden, and hand a political weapon to Republicans desperate for a distracting issue in the wake of Donald Trump's 34-count conviction in the New York hush-money case last week.\n\nProsecutors allege that Biden lied about his drug use on application forms when he purchased a handgun in 2018.

We're in Biden's backyard as the First Son faces felony charges of deceiving a federally licensed firearms dealer, lying on a federal background check form to illegally buy a gun, and unlawfully possessing that firearm.\n\nToday, the trial kicks off with jury selection starting at 8:30 a.m. The jury pool -- consisting of approximately 250 people -- will be whittled down until a jury of 12 and four alternates are ultimately selected. This time-consuming process will likely take days. Overall, the trial is now estimated to last until Friday, June 14, but jury deliberations could stretch the timeframe further.\n\nDue to limited seating in the courtroom, given the large pool of potential jurors, the press and members of the public are not allowed to be present during the reading of the voir dire questions. Once the entire jury pool has been escorted out and those who have answered \"Yes\" to any of the voir dire questions are brought back into the courtroom individually for additional questioning, spectators may enter and observe for the remainder of questioning as well as the peremptory striking period.\n\nAmong the 47 voir dire questions proposed by the court, prospective jurors will be asked:\n\nIn response, both parties jointly submitted a court filing Thursday that included any corrections or objections.\n\nThe defense asked that the word \"knowingly\" be added to Questions 2i. and 2ii., which specify Hunter Biden's charges of making a false statement in the sale of a firearm and making a false statement on a firearms transaction record. Hunter Biden's defense attorneys are heavily relying on the argument that he didn't \"knowingly\" lie when he answered \"No\" to the question of whether he was an addict or user of a controlled substance, i.e. crack cocaine. The defense insists Hunter Biden didn't understand exactly what those terms meant at the time he filled out the form and truly believed he wasn't either one in the \"present tense.\"\n\n\"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\" the defense disputed.\n\n\"Words sometimes are understood to have different meanings to different people...\" Hunter Biden's lawyers wrote, raising a good-faith defense that he acted honestly, even if he was mistaken or misunderstood the question. \"It does not matter whether you or Congress or anyone else would define the defendant as an 'addict' or 'user of controlled substances,' if Mr. Biden did not understand that he was an 'addict' or 'user' [...] he did not knowingly break the law then either and he must be found not guilty.\"\n\nHunter Biden's legal team has argued he is being unfairly targeted because of his famous father while critics say he's getting off easy due to who his dad is. The questions concerning the presidential elections could significantly cut down the jury pool.\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika, who's presiding over the proceedings, gets the final say on which questions are asked.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mia_cathell@townhall.com", "name": "Mia Cathell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voir_dire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Voir dire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deliberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "License"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_false_statements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Making false statements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crack cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Controlled substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Education", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Regulatory_and_Legal", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Regulatory and Legal", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual_Addiction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual Addiction", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/images/up/2024/154/f5c27b36-964f-4c90-a009-aa73b9a02c2c.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 693, "textEnd": 700}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

This week it is illegal possession of a Colt .38 firearm and the use of crack cocaine.\n\nThe first criminal trial of the child of a sitting United States president swiftly follows the first criminal trial of a former president. The legal travails of former president Donald Trump and presidential son Hunter Biden are trials of the American political system.\n\nThe two trials have become brickbats in the 2024 presidential election. Whether the trial of Hunter Biden on drug and gun charges, which begins Monday, is seen by voters as an antidote to the Trump trial or an analogue to it, remains to be seen. Will it neutralize Mr. Trump's political liability? Or increase President Joe Biden's political vulnerability? Or both? Or neither?\n\n\"The Republicans are convinced that the Bidens are crooked and the Democrats think the Hunter trial will be nothing but bad political theater,\" said Daniel Shea, a political scientist at Colby College in Waterville, Me. \"The undecideds could conclude that the Bidens are corrupt or that the President just wants to protect his kid. It's just another example of the divisiveness and ugliness of our politics.\"\n\nOne way or another, the Hunter Biden trial in Wilmington, Del., is an affirmation of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's sad but sober conviction that \"one of the worst things in the world is being the child of a president.\"\n\nHunter Biden has experienced both the heights and depths of the presidential-child experience. His critics believe he has profited by the use of the family name in business - a charge that followed Ulysses S. Grant Jr. a century and a half ago. Mr. Biden's supporters speak of the terrible burden that presidential children carry.\n\nIn truth, the record is mixed.\n\nFor every Lyon Tyler (son of John Tyler, president from 1841 to 1845), who became the president of the College of William and Mary, there is a John Tyler Jr., an alcoholic who spent most of his years in poverty and was for a time buried in a public vault. For every James Hayes (son of Rutherford B. Hayes, 1877-1881), who became the founder of the Union Carbide Corporation, there is a Chester Arthur II (son of Chester Arthur, 1881-1885), a profligate womanizer who never held a job. For every Margaret Truman (daughter of Harry Truman, 1945-1953), once a popular writer of mysteries, there is a John Van Buren (son of Martin Van Buren, 1837-1841), who became known for his drinking and financial recklessness.\n\nBut eight presidential sons were elected to Congress, two (John Quincy Adams in 1824 and George W. Bush in 2000) to the presidency. While several presidential children had stable marriages - Ms. Truman to The New York Times managing editor Clifton Daniel, and Caroline Kennedy, twice an ambassador, to the designer and author Edwin Schlossberg, for example - the five surviving children of Franklin Roosevelt had a cumulative total of 19 marriages.\n\nWhen George H. W. Bush was elected president, his aide Doug Wead produced a 44-page report for Mr. Bush's son, George W. Bush, on the history of presidential children. He found higher-than-average rates of divorce, alcoholism and premature death. \"Being related to a president,\" he wrote, \"brought more problems than opportunities.\" Later, in a 2003 book, All the President's Children, Mr. Wead, who died in 2021, added presciently that \"Some presidential children seemed bent on self-destruction.\"\n\nThat description seems to fit the younger Mr. Biden, who in his 2021 autobiography, Beautiful Things, wrote that \"I had no plan beyond the moment-to-moment demands of the crack pipe.\"\n\nBut drug use is only part of the focus of this spring's trial, and accounts for but a fraction of the barrage of criticism from the Trump team, which argues that the younger Biden - sometimes with the subtle or even overt support and involvement of his father - engaged in questionable business practices. Mr. Trump has repeatedly charged that Hunter Biden leveraged the family name to win contracts in Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan and China, an echo of the post-presidential years of the Grants.\n\nThe Biden family has denied the accusations, which in the case of Ukraine were the basis of the first impeachment of Mr. Trump, when Democrats argued that the 45th president tried to force Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Biden family's business involvement in his country.\n\nThe Biden administration and friends of the Bidens argue that the President is exceedingly devoted to, and protective of, his family. Mr. Biden lost his first wife, Neilia, and infant daughter Naomi in an automobile crash shortly after being elected to the Senate in 1972 and then lost his oldest son, Beau, to a glioblastoma brain tumor almost exactly nine years ago.\n\n\"Family for him has always been number one,\" Democratic Governor John Carney of Delaware, who has known the Bidens for decades, said in an interview. \"It's partially the result of losing his wife and baby daughter just after he was elected to the Senate, and then losing his son Beau. He has held tight and hard to his family. The love he has for his son is boundless, endless, unconditional.\"\n\nThe younger Mr. Biden testified in U.S. District Court in July that he had not used drugs or alcohol since 2019. He also faces charges of tax evasion in a separate case, set to go to trial in September.\n\nThe Trump rhetoric about the \"Biden crime family\" also relates to the President's younger brother, Jim Biden, who has been accused of invoking the family name to benefit his work with an American health care chain.\n\nJim Biden is not the only presidential sibling to face public scrutiny.\n\nBilly Carter, the younger brother of Jimmy Carter (1977-1981), was known for clownish behaviour and later went into alcohol rehab.\n\nDonald Nixon, a younger brother of Richard Nixon (1969-1974), came under fire for accepting a $205,000 loan from the reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes, a factor in Mr. Nixon's unsuccessful 1960 presidential and 1962 California gubernatorial campaigns. \"It wasn't a preoccupation of his,\" said Kenneth Khachigian, a longtime Nixon aide. \"He never complained about him, never said he caused pain. Of all the things that were troublesome to Nixon, from Vietnam and Watergate to the economy and gas prices, Don Nixon was the least of his problems.\"", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tyler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Tyler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifton_Daniel", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clifton Daniel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_A._Arthur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chester A.

He had been addicted to crack cocaine, bouncing in and out of rehab, was divorced, using prostitutes and having money problems. The New York Times reported last year that Mr. Biden later recounted to friends going into the gun store on a whim and buying the .38 because he thought spending time at a shooting range would help him avoid using drugs.\n\nIn purchasing the gun, Mr. Biden had to fill out a form for a federal background check. In response to a question on the form about whether he was using drugs, Mr. Biden said he was not -- an assertion that prosecutors concluded was false.\n\nThe first two charges against Mr. Biden are essentially the same -- that he lied about his drug use to illegally obtain the weapon, and that he falsely claimed that he was not \"addicted to any stimulant, narcotic drug, and any other controlled substance\" on the federal form, known as a 4473.\n\nThe third charge, illegal possession of the gun while under the influence of drugs, stems from the time he had the weapon. Hallie Biden, his brother Beau's widow -- and his romantic partner at the time -- eventually discovered the gun and threw it into a dumpster.\n\nThe section of federal law cited in the indictment, 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 922, is the main statute used to define who can and cannot possess a firearm. It bars drug users, people convicted of felonies whose punishment exceeds a one-year prison sentence, fugitives from justice, people judged to be \"mentally defective,\" and those receiving dishonorable discharges from the military.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_Cobra", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt Cobra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_juries_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand juries in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crack cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "License"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stimulant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military discharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Regulatory_and_Legal", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Regulatory and Legal", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615607", "eventUri": "eng-9615607", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-12", "dateEnd": "2018-10-23", "textStart": 901, "textEnd": 917}], "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

First Lady Jill Biden is in attendance for the first day of the trial.\n\nAhead of the trial, Joe Biden issued a statement on the matter:\n\nThe statement reads:\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean. As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength. Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\"\n\nWhile one can understand a father expressing his love and support for his son under such circumstances, Biden's assertion that \"As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases...\" is interesting to note. He's obviously already commented on former President Donald Trump's recent trial and conviction in Manhattan, but that was a state case.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nBiden's Smirking Speech on Trump Verdict Is Disgusting Display and Travesty of Justice\n\nBiden-Harris Campaign Issues Completely Disgusting Statement After Trump Conviction\n\nHe's also weighed in previously on Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents -- the subject of one of the two of Trump's prosecutions by Biden's Justice Department.\n\nSeeing the classified documents turned up by an Aug. 8 FBI search of Trump's Florida residence at Mar-a-Lago caused Biden to wonder \"how anyone can be that irresponsible,\" he said in an interview on CBS' \"60 Minutes\" program.\n\n(Those comments, of course, were made ahead of the discovery that Biden himself had some classified documents issues.)\n\nBiden has also commented on January 6 and on the Colorado court ruling regarding Trump's inclusion on the ballot, referring to Trump as an \"insurrectionist.\" Thus, one gets the distinct impression that Biden won't remain so circumspect on federal cases not involving his own flesh and blood.\n\nMia Cathell over at our sister

By a quirk of courtroom scheduling, Hunter Biden's trial in a Delaware federal court kicks off just three days after a Manhattan jury convicted the 45th president on 34 charges of corrupt election interference.\n\nBecause logic is the first casualty of Trumpian political warfare, there will not be much, or any, reasoned discussion of the facts in the Hunter Biden case. The presidential failson has already admitted to lying about his past chemical exploits on his application to own a firearm; the offense in question is very rarely tried in court, which is a key reason it was part of an earlier plea deal, since scuttled by a federal judge. MAGA toadies burst into righteous fury over that mundane arrangement, so the Delaware trial would, one might think, be a moment of vindication for them, in which the forces of impartial justice have prevailed over shady backroom legal deals engineered by \"the Biden crime family.\"\n\nBut one would, of course, be wrong. In anticipation of this week's trial, Texas GOP Senator Ted Cruz fulminated on his podcast that President Joe Biden, who made an unannounced visit to the home of Hunter's former partner, Hallie, was engaging in \"witness tampering,\" since Hallie Biden is on the prosecution's witness list. (In reality, Biden visited her ahead of the anniversary of the death of his son, Beau, Hallie's ex-husband.)\n\nCruz's outburst is an advance whiff of the faux outrage sure to be coming off the Trump movement as it seeks to exploit the seamy Hunter Biden saga for titillating clicks and slapdash insinuations of sinister wrongdoing in the House of Biden. This is, after all, the same pasteboard MAGA target who had his naked social-media photos emblazoned across a congressional hearing, to document the seemingly urgent public case that addicts exercise poor personal judgment. Congress's Inspector Javert act in the Hunter Biden case became so baroque that it ultimately rested on the testimony of Alexander Smirnov, an FBI informant indicted on charges of lying to federal agents while allegedly laundering bogus claims from Russian intelligence sources. But the right's lying useful idiot served his purpose: During the time when Smirnov was treated as a highly placed whistleblower, his reveries fueled 85 segments of Sean Hannity's Mad Libs diorama of MAGA outage in 2023 alone. They also were the basis, to use the term generously, of the House's predictably doomed bid to impeach Joe Biden.\n\nWhen legal partisans don't have the facts on their side, they pound the table, seeking to distract judges and juries with breathless allegations about the other side's twisted motives and MOs. That was the refrain taken up by Trump's congressional chorus of lickspittle supporters, and of course by the felon himself, in Truth Social tirade after Truth Social tirade contending that a corrupt Democratic legal system in New York had rigged every element of the case against Trump in advance. However, the inconvenient truth here is that David Weiss, the special prosecutor who helped arrange Hunter Biden's original plea deal, was himself a Trump appointee, whose appointment was renewed by Biden's attorney general, Merrick Garland. Even as determined a quisling as Cruz can't concoct a lawfare conspiracy out of that.\n\nStill, if the past eight years have taught us anything, it's that implausibility is no barrier to MAGA resentments -- if anything, it acts as an accelerant. So look for the Trump faithful to continue hammering away at the sordid, already well-documented evidence of Hunter Biden's past debauches as evidence of the sitting president's perfidy.\n\nYou won't have to overtax your imagination to picture where their rhetoric is headed: The same day that Donald Trump's criminal conviction was announced, a \"swatting\" hoax, intended to create a trigger-happy emergency response, targeted the mother of former Capitol Police officer Michael Fanone. Fairfax County police received an e-mail from someone impersonating Fanone who claimed to have killed his mother and to set out to massacre students at a nearby school. Fanone, himself a first responder at the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, had provoked Trump's legions by taking part in a press event outside Trump's courtroom where he denounced the former president as an authoritarian for stirring up the January 6 mob into a melee that gave Fanone a heart attack, as he heard insurrectionists chant, \"Kill him with his own gun!\" Fanone, who voted for Trump in 2016, got an earlier dose of the GOP's organized thuggery when then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy brazenly lied to him in a private meeting, contending that Trump was unaware that the attack at the Capitol was happening.\n\nThis is, in other words, the self-described law-and-order political movement minting the travails of addiction into a grand election conspiracy in order to deflect from its leader's real criminal plot to interfere with an election. I'd say its partisans should be ashamed themselves, but that concept has no operable meaning for anyone taking ethical cues from Ted Cruz.", "source": {"uri": "thenation.com", "dataType": "news",

(AP) -- The 150th Kentucky Derby produced one of the most dramatic finishes in its storied history -- three noses at the wire.\n\nMystik Dan desperately fought to hang on with two challengers coming to him in the closing strides. He did, too, after a delay of several minutes while the closest three-horse photo finish since 1947 was sorted out.\n\nThat year, Jet Pilot won by a head over Phalanx, who was another head in front of Faultless.\n\nThis one was much tighter.\n\nMystik Dan, an 18-1 shot, edged Sierra Leone by a nose, with Forever Young another nose back in third on Saturday. Sierra Leone was the most expensive horse in the race at $2.3 million.\n\nLong shots Track Phantom and Just Steel led the field through the early going, with 3-1 favorite Fierceness racing three-wide just off the leaders.\n\nAt the top of the stretch, everything changed.\n\nTrack Phantom drifted off the rail, opening a hole that Hernandez squeezed Mystik Dan through, and the bay colt suddenly found another gear. He quickly opened up a daylight advantage on the field.\n\n\"When he shot through that spot, he was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it,\" Hernandez said. \"He shot off and I'm like, 'Oh man, I've got a big chance to win the Kentucky Derby.'\"\n\nTo Mystik Dan's outside, Sierra Leone and Forever Young took up the chase in the middle of the track.\n\nAs Mystik Dan sped along the rail, Sierra Leone lugged in and bumped Forever Young three times in the stretch, but jockey Ryusei Sakai didn't claim foul.\n\nMystik Dan got so close to the rail that Hernandez's boot struck it.\n\n\"But I think we can buy another pair of boots,\" he said.\n\nThe winner's share of the record $5 million purse was $3.1 million, with the jockey and trainer typically earning 10% each.\n\n\"Just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey and ride,\" McPeek said. \"Brian is one of the most underrated jockeys, but not anymore, right?\"\n\nSierra Leone, the second choice at 9-2 odds, and Forever Young from Japan came up just short at the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs, the largest crowd since 2018.\n\n\"You get beat a nose in the Kentucky Derby, it's a tough one,\" said Chad Brown, trainer of Sierra Leone. \"But I'm so proud of the horse.\"\n\nIt was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- the closest margin in horse racing -- and the first since Grindstone edged Cavonnier to wear the garland of red roses in 1996.\n\nThe crowd waited several minutes in the heat and humidity as the result was reviewed by the stewards and declared official.\n\n\"The longest few minutes of my life,\" Hernandez said, after he and Mystik Dan walked in circles while the stunning result was settled. \"To see your number flash up to win the Derby, I don't think it will sink in for a while.\"\n\nFierceness finished 15th in the field of 20 3-year-olds. Owner Mike Repole is 0 for 8 in the derby. He had the favorite in 2011 with Uncle Mo, who was scratched the day before the race with an illness. Last year, Forte was scratched the morning of the race as the favorite with a bruised foot.\n\nMystik Dan ran 1 1/4 miles over a fast track in 2:03.34 and paid $39.22, $16.32 and $10.\n\nHernandez and trainer Kenny McPeek had teamed for a wire-to-wire win in the Kentucky Oaks for fillies on Friday with Thorpedo Anna. McPeek is the first trainer to sweep both races since Ben Jones in 1952.\n\nMcPeek's only other victory in a Triple Crown race was also a shocker: 70-1 Sarava won the 2002 Belmont Stakes -- the biggest upset in that race's history. The colt spoiled the Triple Crown bid of War Emblem.\n\nThe winning owners are cousins Lance and Brent Gasaway and Daniel Hamby III, all from Arkansas. They bred Mystik Dan.\n\n\"We've done it with what I call working-class horse,\" McPeek said, explaining the colt's sire and dam weren't big names.\n\nSharilyn Gasaway, Brent's wife, said, \"It is surreal for sure. We feel like we're just ordinary people and we've got an amazing horse.\"\n\nSierra Leone returned $6.54 and $4.64. Forever Young was another nose back in third and paid $5.58 to show.\n\nCatching Freedom was fourth, followed by T O Password of Japan, Resilience, Stronghold, Honor Marie and Endlessly. Dornoch was 10th and then came Track Phantom, West Saratoga, Domestic Product, Epic Ride, Fierceness, Society Man, Just Steel, Grand Mo the First, Catalytic and Just a Touch.\n\nAP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "beth_harris@eagletribune.com", "name": "Beth Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forever_Young_(Alphaville_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forever Young (Alphaville song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phalanx (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Pilot_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet Pilot (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faultless", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faultless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Brown_(horse_trainer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chad Brown (horse trainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindstone_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grindstone (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bay (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2002 Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Repole", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Repole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_A._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben A.

(AP) -- The 150th Kentucky Derby produced one of the most dramatic finishes in its storied history -- three noses at the wire.\n\nMystik Dan desperately fought to hang on with two challengers coming to him in the closing strides. He did, too, after a delay of several minutes while the closest three-horse photo finish since 1947 was sorted out.\n\nThat year, Jet Pilot won by a head over Phalanx, who was another head in front of Faultless.\n\nThis one was much tighter.\n\nMystik Dan, an 18-1 shot, edged Sierra Leone by a nose, with Forever Young another nose back in third on Saturday. Sierra Leone was the most expensive horse in the race at $2.3 million.\n\nLong shots Track Phantom and Just Steel led the field through the early going, with 3-1 favorite Fierceness racing three-wide just off the leaders.\n\nAt the top of the stretch, everything changed.\n\nTrack Phantom drifted off the rail, opening a hole that Hernandez squeezed Mystik Dan through, and the bay colt suddenly found another gear. He quickly opened up a daylight advantage on the field.\n\n\"When he shot through that spot, he was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it,\" Hernandez said. \"He shot off and I'm like, 'Oh man, I've got a big chance to win the Kentucky Derby.'\"\n\nTo Mystik Dan's outside, Sierra Leone and Forever Young took up the chase in the middle of the track.\n\nAs Mystik Dan sped along the rail, Sierra Leone lugged in and bumped Forever Young three times in the stretch, but jockey Ryusei Sakai didn't claim foul.\n\nMystik Dan got so close to the rail that Hernandez's boot struck it.\n\n\"But I think we can buy another pair of boots,\" he said.\n\nThe winner's share of the record $5 million purse was $3.1 million, with the jockey and trainer typically earning 10% each.\n\n\"Just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey and ride,\" McPeek said. \"Brian is one of the most underrated jockeys, but not anymore, right?\"\n\nSierra Leone, the second choice at 9-2 odds, and Forever Young from Japan came up just short at the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs, the largest crowd since 2018.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"You get beat a nose in the Kentucky Derby, it's a tough one,\" said Chad Brown, trainer of Sierra Leone. \"But I'm so proud of the horse.\"\n\nIt was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- the closest margin in horse racing -- and the first since Grindstone edged Cavonnier to wear the garland of red roses in 1996.\n\nThe crowd waited several minutes in the heat and humidity as the result was reviewed by the stewards and declared official.\n\n\"The longest few minutes of my life,\" Hernandez said, after he and Mystik Dan walked in circles while the stunning result was settled. \"To see your number flash up to win the Derby, I don't think it will sink in for a while.\"\n\nFierceness finished 15th in the field of 20 3-year-olds. Owner Mike Repole is 0 for 8 in the derby. He had the favorite in 2011 with Uncle Mo, who was scratched the day before the race with an illness. Last year, Forte was scratched the morning of the race as the favorite with a bruised foot.\n\nMystik Dan ran 1 1/4 miles over a fast track in 2:03.34 and paid $39.22, $16.32 and $10.\n\nHernandez and trainer Kenny McPeek had teamed for a wire-to-wire win in the Kentucky Oaks for fillies on Friday with Thorpedo Anna. McPeek is the first trainer to sweep both races since Ben Jones in 1952.\n\nMcPeek's only other victory in a Triple Crown race was also a shocker: 70-1 Sarava won the 2002 Belmont Stakes -- the biggest upset in that race's history. The colt spoiled the Triple Crown bid of War Emblem.\n\nThe winning owners are cousins Lance and Brent Gasaway and Daniel Hamby III, all from Arkansas. They bred Mystik Dan.\n\n\"We've done it with what I call working-class horse,\" McPeek said, explaining the colt's sire and dam weren't big names.\n\nSharilyn Gasaway, Brent's wife, said, \"It is surreal for sure. We feel like we're just ordinary people and we've got an amazing horse.\"\n\nSierra Leone returned $6.54 and $4.64. Forever Young was another nose back in third and paid $5.58 to show.\n\nCatching Freedom was fourth, followed by T O Password of Japan, Resilience, Stronghold, Honor Marie and Endlessly. Dornoch was 10th and then came Track Phantom, West Saratoga, Domestic Product, Epic Ride, Fierceness, Society Man, Just Steel, Grand Mo the First, Catalytic and Just a Touch.\n\nAP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "beth_harris@gazette.com", "name": "Beth Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forever_Young_(Alphaville_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forever Young (Alphaville song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phalanx (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Pilot_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet Pilot (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faultless", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faultless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bay (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Brown_(horse_trainer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chad Brown (horse trainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindstone_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grindstone (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2002 Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Repole", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Repole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_A._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben A.

(AP) -- The 150th Kentucky Derby produced one of the most dramatic finishes in its storied history -- three noses at the wire.\n\nMystik Dan desperately fought to hang on with two challengers coming to him in the closing strides. He did, too, after a delay of several minutes while the closest three-horse photo finish since 1947 was sorted out.\n\nThat year, Jet Pilot won by a head over Phalanx and a length ahead of Faultless.\n\nLong shots Track Phantom and Just Steel led the field through the early going, with 3-1 favorite Fierceness racing three-wide just off the leaders.\n\nAt the top of the stretch, everything changed.\n\nTrack Phantom drifted off the rail, opening a hole that Hernandez squeezed Mystik Dan through, and the bay colt suddenly found another gear. He quickly opened up a daylight advantage on the field.\n\n\"When he shot through that spot, he was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it,\" Hernandez said. \"He shot off and I'm like, 'Oh man, I've got a big chance to win the Kentucky Derby.'\"\n\nTo Mystik Dan's outside, Sierra Leone and Forever Young took up the chase in the middle of the track.\n\nAs Mystik Dan sped along the rail, Sierra Leone lugged in and bumped Forever Young three times in the stretch, but jockey Ryusei Sakai didn't claim foul.\n\nMystik Dan got so close to the rail that Hernandez's boot struck it.\n\n\"But I think we can buy another pair of boots,\" he said.\n\nThe winner's share of the record $5 million purse was $3.1 million, with the jockey and trainer typically earning 10% each.\n\n\"Just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey and ride,\" McPeek said. \"Brian is one of the most underrated jockeys, but not anymore, right?\"\n\nSierra Leone, the second choice at 9-2 odds, and Forever Young from Japan came up just short at the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs, the largest crowd since 2018.\n\n\"You get beat a nose in the Kentucky Derby, it's a tough one,\" said Chad Brown, trainer of Sierra Leone. \"But I'm so proud of the horse.\"\n\nIt was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- the closest margin in horse racing -- and the first since Grindstone edged Cavonnier to wear the garland of red roses in 1996.\n\nThe crowd waited several minutes in the heat and humidity as the result was reviewed by the stewards and declared official.\n\n\"The longest few minutes of my life,\" Hernandez said, after he and Mystik Dan walked in circles while the stunning result was settled. \"To see your number flash up to win the Derby, I don't think it will sink in for a while.\"\n\nFierceness finished 15th in the field of 20 3-year-olds. Owner Mike Repole is 0 for 8 in the derby. He had the favorite in 2011 with Uncle Mo, who was scratched the day before the race with an illness. Last year, Forte was scratched the morning of the race as the favorite with a bruised foot.\n\nMystik Dan ran 1 1/4 miles over a fast track in 2:03.34 and paid $39.22, $16.32 and $10.\n\nHernandez and trainer Kenny McPeek had teamed for a wire-to-wire win in the Kentucky Oaks for fillies on Friday with Thorpedo Anna. McPeek is the first trainer to sweep both races since Ben Jones in 1952.\n\nMcPeek's only other victory in a Triple Crown race was also a shocker: 70-1 Sarava won the 2002 Belmont Stakes -- the biggest upset in that race's history. The colt spoiled the Triple Crown bid of War Emblem.\n\nThe winning owners are cousins Lance and Brent Gasaway and Daniel Hamby III, all from Arkansas. They bred Mystik Dan.\n\n\"We've done it with what I call working-class horse,\" McPeek said. \"His mother is a filly who raced hard, but wasn't well known. His father wasn't a big name, either.\"\n\nSharilyn Gasaway, Brent's wife, said, \"It is surreal for sure. We feel like we're just ordinary people and we've got an amazing horse.\"\n\nSierra Leone returned $6.54 and $4.64. Forever Young was another nose back in third and paid $5.58 to show.\n\nCatching Freedom was fourth, followed by T O Password of Japan, Resilience, Stronghold, Honor Marie and Endlessly.

Mystik Dan will travel to Saratoga, N.Y., before they decide whether to enter him in the 1 3/16 mile Preakness.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek said Sunday morning outside his barn on Churchill Downs' back side. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. ... So, we'll just watch him over the next week. It'll be one of those (situations) where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nThe picturesque track in upstate New York will host the Triple Crown's final jewel for the next three years while Belmont Park is being reconstructed. The Belmont has also been shortened to a 1 1/4 mile, matching the Derby distance that Mystik Dan won by a nose over Sierra Leone and Japan-bred Forever Young in the closest three-way finish since 1947.\n\nThe five-week gap follows a more normal race schedule for many thoroughbreds and some trainers might opt to head to Saratoga to acclimate horses sooner.\n\nChad Brown said Sierra Leone will skip the Preakness and leave on Monday to train at Saratoga and run the Belmont. Considering how much it took for Sierra Leone to navigate other horses and chase down Mystik Dan before falling a nose short at the wire, rest sounds necessary.\n\n\"He's a real laid back horse but when we brought him out, was a little more tired than he normally is after his races,\" Brown said. \"I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nLouisville-born trainer Brad Cox is watching Catching Freedom (fourth) and Just A Touch (20th) before deciding their next steps. Forever Young and fellow Japan-bred T O Password (fifth) are headed home on Tuesday.\n\nThat could leave the Preakness without some Derby star power at first glance, though it won't lack for plotlines with a number of well-rested horses expected to compete at Pimlico Race Course.\n\nHall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert could have two entrants as he seeks to follow up National Treasure's victory there last spring. He trains Santa Anita Derby runner-up Imagination and Arkansas Derby winner Muth, who missed the Derby after failed legal attempts by owner Amr Zedan to get him in despite Baffert's suspension by Churchill Downs through the end of 2024.\n\nAs McPeek and the owners ponder a decision, he and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. basked in a wash of congratulations for a Derby victory that put them in exclusive company.\n\nSaturday's win helped both claim rare weekend sweeps of the Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies. McPeek is just the third trainer to do that and first since Ben Jones (who did it twice) in 1952, while Hernandez is the eighth rider to achieve the feat and first since fellow Louisiana native and Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Mystik Dan just stood calm and unfazed as a cluster of onlookers took photos and selfies as workers bathed him outside the barn. He was then draped with the winner's blanket signifying his Derby win before being led back to his stall with a WWE-style title belt laying on an outer wall. Oaks-winning filly Thorpedo Anna also made a brief appearance and soaked in the attention.\n\nHernandez is preparing for his own life-changing spotlight and title after claiming the sport's marquee race. He dined with his family after the Derby but didn't sleep much, a routine that figures to go on for the next few days amid a flood of interview requests. At some point he hopes to get his mind around all that has happened, but he already has a response ready.\n\n\"When somebody asks what my profession is, I'm able to tell them I'm a professional jockey. And then the first question they normally ask is, 'Have you ever won the Kentucky Derby?' I can say that [I have] now.\"\n\nTrainer Kenneth McPeek, right, hand off the trophy to jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. as Hernandez celebrates in the winner's circle after riding Mystik Dan to win the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race at Churchill Downs Saturday, May 4, 2024, in Louisville, Ky.

He quickly opened up a daylight advantage on the field.\n\n\"When he shot through that spot, he was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it,\" Hernandez said. \"He shot off and I'm like, 'Oh man, I've got a big chance to win the Kentucky Derby.'\"\n\nTo Mystik Dan's outside, Sierra Leone and Forever Young took up the chase in the middle of the track.\n\nAs Mystik Dan sped along the rail, Sierra Leone lugged in and bumped Forever Young three times in the stretch, but jockey Ryusei Sakai didn't claim foul.\n\nMystik Dan got so close to the rail that Hernandez's boot struck it.\n\n\"But I think we can buy another pair of boots,\" he said.\n\nThe winner's share of the record $5 million purse was $3.1 million, with the jockey and trainer typically earning 10% each.\n\n\"Just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey and ride,\" McPeek said. \"Brian is one of the most underrated jockeys, but not anymore, right?\"\n\nSierra Leone, the second choice at 9-2 odds, and Forever Young from Japan came up just short at the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs, the largest crowd since 2018.\n\n\"You get beat a nose in the Kentucky Derby, it's a tough one,\" said Chad Brown, trainer of Sierra Leone. \"But I'm so proud of the horse.\"\n\nIt was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- the closest margin in horse racing -- and the first since Grindstone edged Cavonnier to wear the garland of red roses in 1996.\n\nThe crowd waited several minutes in the heat and humidity as the result was reviewed by the stewards and declared official.\n\n\"The longest few minutes of my life,\" Hernandez said, after he and Mystik Dan walked in circles while the stunning result was settled. \"To see your number flash up to win the Derby, I don't think it will sink in for a while.\"\n\nFierceness finished 15th in the field of 20 3-year-olds.

McPeek is the first trainer to sweep both races since Ben Jones in 1952.\n\nMcPeek's only other victory in a Triple Crown race was also a shocker: 70-1 Sarava won the 2002 Belmont Stakes -- the biggest upset in that race's history.

(AP) -- The 150th Kentucky Derby produced one of the most dramatic finishes in its storied history -- three noses at the wire.\n\nMystik Dan desperately fought to hang on with two challengers coming to him in the closing strides. He did, too, after a delay of several minutes while the closest three-horse photo finish since 1947 was sorted out.\n\nThat year, Jet Pilot won by a head over Phalanx and a length ahead of Faultless.\n\nMystik Dan, an 18-1 shot, edged Sierra Leone by a nose, with Forever Young another nose back in third on Saturday.\n\nJockey Brian Hernandez Jr. squeezed Mystik Dan through a tight spot to reach the rail turning for home and the bay colt suddenly found another gear. He took off down the stretch and built a slight lead.\n\n\"When he shot through that spot, he was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it,\" Hernandez said. \"He shot off and I'm like, 'Oh man, I've got a big chance to win the Kentucky Derby.'\"\n\nMystik Dan got so close to the rail that Hernandez's boot struck it.\n\n\"But I think we can buy another pair of boots,\" he said.\n\nThe winner's share of the record $5 million purse was $3.1 million, with the jockey and trainer typically earning 10% each.\n\n\"Just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey and ride,\" McPeek said. \"Brian is one of the most underrated jockeys, but not anymore, right?\"\n\nSierra Leone, the second choice at 9-2 odds, and Forever Young from Japan gave chase and pressured the leader to the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs, the largest crowd since 2018.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIt was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- the closest margin in horse racing -- and the first since Grindstone edged Cavonnier to wear the garland of red roses in 1996.\n\nThe crowd waited several minutes in the heat and humidity as the result was reviewed by the stewards and declared official.\n\n\"The longest few minutes of my life,\" Hernandez said, after he and Mystik Dan walked in circles while the stunning result was settled. \"To see your number flash up to win the Derby, I don't think it will sink in for a while.\"\n\nFierceness, the 3-1 favorite, finished 15th in the field of 20 3-year-olds. Owner Mike Repole is 0 for 8 in the derby. He had the favorite in 2011 with Uncle Mo, who was scratched the day before the race with an illness. Last year, Forte was scratched the morning of the race as the favorite with a bruised foot.\n\nMystik Dan ran 1 1/4 miles over a fast track in 2:03.34 and paid $39.22, $16.32 and $10.\n\nHernandez and trainer Kenny McPeek had teamed for a wire-to-wire win in the Kentucky Oaks for fillies on Friday with Thorpedo Anna. McPeek is the first trainer to sweep both races since Ben Jones in 1952.\n\nMcPeek's only other victory in a Triple Crown race was also a shocker: 70-1 Sarava won the 2002 Belmont Stakes -- the biggest upset in that race's history. The colt spoiled the Triple Crown bid of War Emblem.\n\nThe winning owners are cousins Lance and Brent Gasaway and Daniel Hamby III, all from Arkansas.\n\nSierra Leone returned $6.54 and $4.64. Forever Young was another nose back in third and paid $5.58 to show.\n\nSierra Leone lugged in and bumped Forever Young three times in the stretch, but jockey Ryusei Sakai didn't claim foul.\n\nCatching Freedom was fourth, followed by T O Password of Japan, Resilience, Stronghold, Honor Marie and Endlessly. Dornoch was 10th and then came Track Phantom, West Saratoga, Domestic Product, Epic Ride, Fierceness, Society Man, Just Steel, Grand Mo the First, Catalytic and Just a Touch.\n\nAP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "beth_harris@omaha.com", "name": "Beth Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forever_Young_(Alphaville_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forever Young (Alphaville song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phalanx (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Pilot_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet Pilot (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faultless", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faultless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bay (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindstone_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grindstone (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2002 Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Repole", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Repole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_A._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben A.

Breaking two stalls from the rail, and under the cool, sure hand of Louisiana-born Brian Hernandez, the young stallion summoned all he had to thread his way through and past the first and then the second tier of far more-favored horses, scrambling to fend off the last two of them, Sierra Leone and Forever Young, in an extraordinarily close photo finish at the wire.\n\nHe won by a nose, but that actually doesn't describe it -- it was something like a whisker, so close that it caused even the Churchill stewards to delay their official call as they pored over the snap -- for the trainers and jockeys involved, not to mention the owners or the thousands of players -- for a couple of very long minutes. Hernandez was turning his horse this way and that on the track with his outrider after the race, trying to figure out if he won. The way he won was this: Hernandez kept Mystik Dan driving to defend his dwindling, microscopic lead, which kept the horse's nose out to graze the line first. On the outside, a Sierra Leone bore down and flashed into place, and between them, Forever Young clung to show.\n\nThe race itself was no less of a cliff-hanger, with the favorite Fierceness popping as expected in to the front early, but then his backers and connections began to rue the day, because it quickly became clear that Fierceness was doing yet another of his dispirited fading tricks up at the top of the backstretch, as the hard-driving pack neared the far turn. He would finish a lackluster fifteenth, with literally all the top horses in the race ahead of him. He did have a bad rather hopping start, but that didn't seem to be enough to be the key to his bad race. Talented though he may be, he didn't even look ready for the Triple Crown's shortest race, the Preakness, much less a Kentucky Derby. It seemed, in fact, as if the infamous fanfare and madness of a Derby day had actually gotten to him. Whether or not that is the case, it's going to be back to school for Mr. Fierceness and Todd Pletcher.\n\nGoing off at 18-1, Mystik Dan paid $39.22 to win, Sierra Leone paid the estimated low $6.54 to place, and Forever Young brought up the rear, bringing $5.58.\n\nIt was a history-making upset for both trainer Kenny McPeek and jockey Brian Hernandez, who had on Friday just won the $1-million Kentucky Oaks with filly Thorpedo Anna. McPeek is the first trainer since 1952 to earn victories in the Oaks and the Derby on the same weekend, and neither Hernandez nor McPeek had ever won the Derby.\n\nFor his part, the elated McPeek, who has won both the Preakness and the Belmont, knew precisely what a superb tactical performance his pilot Hernandez had given both the trainer and his horse. He told the camera crews: \"I mean, just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey in-ride. Brian's amazing. Probably one of the most underrated riders in racing. But not anymore.\"\n\nWhat McPeek was referring to with that curious construct \"in-ride\" was that, quite early, Hernandez had tactically found a spot just off the front-runners on the rail, which accomplished two crucial tasks and created much opportunity for his mount horse during the race. It might seem counterintuitive to take to the rail in the Kentucky Derby, but that is just in the early, terrifying going into the first turn. But: Tucked into their pocket on the rail just behind the leaders by Hernandez, Mystik Dan and his jockey enjoyed many easy strides up the backstretch in a sort of eye-of-the-storm calm, which meant that much of the real heavy battle amid the Derby's inevitable bumper-car jostling played out in the lanes well outside them. The second major advantage that Hernandez' keeping to the rail created was that it saved Mystik Dan a tremendous amount of ground into and out of the far turn. Unlike both his closest competitors, Sierra Leone and Forever Young, Mystik Dan ran a far shorter race.\n\nNecessary as those two huge accomplishments were, by no means did they seal the victory for Mystik Dan or his pilot. They still had the second turn and the stretch , the real killing floor of the race, before them. The moment that began the real building process of their victory came at the half-mile pole.\n\nShortly after that mark, Hernandez realized that he and his mount faced, at last, a traffic problem. There was no way to the outside. There was just a squeezy little whisper of a lane -- not even a full one -- down on the rail. Hernandez drove Mystik Dan headlong for that tiny gap and, predictably, according to the unforgiving rules of the Derby, immediately got bumped, which moment, in a testament to Mystik Dan's mental toughness, threw him a bit up but didn't throw him off his game.\n\nHernandez himself described the moment in a wry horseman's laconic way to the cameras post-race: \"Around the far turn, my horse was so game being up on the inside. I came through a really tight spot and we kind of climbed up on top of the rail a bit. When he shot through that spot and was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it, he shot off. I was like, 'Oh man, we have a shot to win the Kentucky Derby.'\"\n\nYet the race was still not over for them, because, of course, the daunting Derby stretch lay like a range of mountains ready to dash everything that the two of them had miraculously done to that point. Down the stretch, Hernandez had plenty of horse under him and eked out, for a moment, an almost two-length lead on the pack, but the infamous closer Sierra Leone and his pilot Tyler Gaffalione were in a furious stretch battle many lanes to the outside with the touted Japan-owned runner Forever Young. Forever Young was giving Sierra Leone a run for his money, and the sheer closing power and momentum of that entertaining battle carried the both horses literally around the entire field and right up alongside Hernandez and Mystik Dan.\n\nIn the last hundred yards then, the fourth and arguably the hardest chapter of this Derby shifted into high gear. Stride for stride, it looked as if Sierra Leone would live up to his billing and storm by Mystik Dan, which in fact he and Forever Young both did on the gallop out, pretty much in the instant they passed the wire. Put another way, Mystik Dan's victory was less a stalwart stretch-duel defense of his lead and more a combination of everything that Hernandez and Mystic Dan had done, the sum of which had, in the last seconds, put them just barely out of reach of the tremendously hard-charging Sierra Leone and Forever Young. If the race were just twenty-five yards longer, Mystic Dan would have run third.\n\nFor their part and for their magnificent close, Sierra Leone and Forever Young acquitted themselves most honorably, and Sierra Leone in particular looks like a fine candidate for the Belmont, should his post-race recovery allow him to point to that grueling contest.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forever_Young_(Alphaville_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forever Young (Alphaville song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stallion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winston Churchill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Oaks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Oaks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Pletcher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Todd Pletcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Gaffalione", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Gaffalione"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_gait", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse gait"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Barrel_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Barrel Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6636dcebdd28f689405b7c6a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539947", "eventUri": "eng-9539947", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

For the 150th edition of the greatest two minutes in sports, the winner's moniker did not disappoint.\n\nIn one of the closest finishes in Derby history, Mystik Dan earned the victory Saturday at Churchill Downs. The 3-year-old bay colt, who entered the competition carrying 18-1 odds, edged out Sierra Leone and Forever Young in a photo finish.\n\nMystik Dan came into the Derby without many accolades to attached to his name. The horse's most notable finishes included a third-place finish at the Arkansas Derby and a win at the Grade III Southwest Stakes.\n\nBut the horse with one of the best names at the Kentucky Derby is now a part of the history books of the event.\n\nHere is more to know about Mystik Dan and the name behind the horse.\n\nMORE: How much prize money does the Kentucky Derby winner get in 2024?\n\nWhen it comes to horses, there always is a story behind the name. It's no exception for the 2024 Kentucky Derby winner.\n\nDaniel Hamby III is one of the owners of the Bay Colt. The horse's name comes from Hamby's father, Dan, and his first business operation. The elder Hamby sold Mystik Tape, so his son elected to combine both the business brand and the first name of his dad, according to the Daily Racing Form.\n\nThe result? Mystik Dan, a name that will now be forever ingrained into Kentucky Derby history.\n\nLance Gasaway, Daniel Hamby and 4G Racing are the owners of Mystik Dan.\n\nThe horse is trained by Lexington-based Kenny McPeek, who earned his first Kentucky Derby win as a trainer with Mystik Dan's finish at the 2024 Derby.\n\nBrian Hernandez Jr. is the jockey for Mystik Dan.\n\nThe 38-year-old hails from Louisiana and comes from a jockey family, according to Bloodhorse. His father, Brian Hernandez Sr., was a jockey, and his younger brother, Colby, currently is a jockey as well. His younger sister, Courtney, also has experience as a jockey.\n\nThe win in 2024 marks the first for Hernandez Jr. He has been a jockey since 2003, and while he has built up an impressive resume during his two-decade long career, Hernandez Jr. never crossed the finish line first at the Derby -- until 2024.\n\nThe win for Mystik Dan at the Kentucky Derby cemented the first Kentucky Oaks-Kentucky Derby double since 1952 and only the fourth ever by a jockey.

(AP) -- The 150th Kentucky Derby produced one of the most dramatic finishes in its storied history -- three noses at the wire.\n\nMystik Dan desperately fought to hang on with two challengers coming to him in the closing strides. He did, too, after a delay of several minutes while the closest three-horse photo finish since 1947 was sorted out.\n\nThat year, Jet Pilot won by a head over Phalanx and a length ahead of Faultless.\n\nMystik Dan, an 18-1 shot, edged Sierra Leone by a nose, with Forever Young another nose back in third on Saturday.\n\nJockey Brian Hernandez Jr. squeezed Mystik Dan through a tight spot to reach the rail turning for home and the bay colt suddenly found another gear. He took off down the stretch and built a slight lead.\n\n\"When he shot through that spot, he was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it,\" Hernandez said. \"He shot off and I'm like, 'Oh man, I've got a big chance to win the Kentucky Derby.'\"\n\nMystik Dan got so close to the rail that Hernandez's boot struck it.\n\n\"But I think we can buy another pair of boots,\" he said.\n\nThe winner's share of the record $5 million purse was $3.1 million, with the jockey and trainer typically earning 10% each.\n\n\"Just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey and ride,\" McPeek said. \"Brian is one of the most underrated jockeys, but not anymore, right?\"\n\nSierra Leone, the second choice at 9-2 odds, and Forever Young from Japan gave chase and pressured the leader to the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs, the largest crowd since 2018.\n\nIt was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- the closest margin in horse racing -- and the first since Grindstone edged Cavonnier to wear the garland of red roses in 1996.\n\nThe crowd waited several minutes in the heat and humidity as the result was reviewed by the stewards and declared official.\n\n\"The longest few minutes of my life,\" Hernandez said, after he and Mystik Dan walked in circles while the stunning result was settled. \"To see your number flash up to win the Derby, I don't think it will sink in for a while.\"\n\nFierceness, the 3-1 favorite, finished 15th in the field of 20 3-year-olds. Owner Mike Repole is 0 for 8 in the derby. He had the favorite in 2011 with Uncle Mo, who was scratched the day before the race with an illness. Last year, Forte was scratched the morning of the race as the favorite with a bruised foot.\n\nMystik Dan ran 1\u00bc miles over a fast track in 2:03.34 and paid $39.22, $16.32 and $10.\n\nHernandez and trainer Kenny McPeek had teamed for a wire-to-wire win in the Kentucky Oaks for fillies on Friday with Thorpedo Anna. McPeek is the first trainer to sweep both races since Ben Jones in 1952.\n\nMcPeek's only other victory in a Triple Crown race was also a shocker: 70-1 Sarava won the 2002 Belmont Stakes -- the biggest upset in that race's history. The colt spoiled the Triple Crown bid of War Emblem.\n\nThe winning owners are cousins Lance and Brent Gasaway and Daniel Hamby III, all from Arkansas.\n\nSierra Leone returned $6.54 and $4.64. Forever Young was another nose back in third and paid $5.58 to show.\n\nSierra Leone lugged in and bumped Forever Young three times in the stretch, but jockey Ryusei Sakai didn't claim foul.\n\nCatching Freedom was fourth, followed by T O Password of Japan, Resilience, Stronghold, Honor Marie and Endlessly. Dornoch was 10th and then came Track Phantom, West Saratoga, Domestic Product, Epic Ride, Fierceness, Society Man, Just Steel, Grand Mo the First, Catalytic and Just a Touch.\n\nThis is breaking news. Previous coverage is below.\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Twenty horses stampeding toward the first turn in a battle for position. A screaming crowd of 150,000 and a fast track.\n\nIt's the 150th Kentucky Derby. Beyond a couple early wagering favorites, it's a wide-open race.\n\nPost time is 6:57 p.m. EDT Saturday. Gloomy skies and occasional rain drops have given way to blue skies and sunshine. The dirt surface was upgraded to fast a couple hours before the race after being muddy to start the day's card.\n\nStylishly dressed fans in colorful outfits and large hats with plumage are seeking shelter from the sun amid high humidity. They're sipping mint juleps in souvenir glasses, smoking cigars and eating strawberries on a stick.\n\nThe threat of wet weather dissipated as the day went on. Fierceness was holding as the 7-2 favorite, followed by Sierra Leone at 5-1. Forever Young, from Japan, was at 6-1, followed by Catching Freedom at 8-1 and Just a Touch at 10-1.\n\nThe Derby will answer the perennial question of which 3-year-old can best handle running 1 1/4 miles in front of the biggest crowd they will ever see and hear.\n\nFierceness and jockey John Velazquez will break from the No. 17 post, which has never produced a derby winner.\n\nThe costliest colt in the 20-horse field is Sierra Leone at $2.3 million.\n\n\"A lot of times you buy an expensive horse like that and they can't run,\" said Peter Brandt, one of the six owners. \"We've very, very lucky he's made it this far. We're looking forward to this race but also looking forward to the future of taking care of this horse.\"\n\nConversely, Larry Demeritte shelled out just $11,000 to buy Saratoga West. The 74-year-old Bahamas native has won 180 races and nearly $5 million in purse money since he started training in 1984. Demeritte is just the second Black trainer since 1951 to saddle a horse for the derby.\n\n\"This is truly amazing how we got to this position with this horse,\" he said.\n\nThe Kentucky Derby winner earns $3.1 million from the record purse of $5 million.\n\nForever Young is one of two entries from Japan. The other is T O Password. The country has never won the race.\n\nThis year's race is one for the ages, too. D. Wayne Lukas, the 88-year-old trainer with four Kentucky Derby wins, saddles Just Steel. Frankie Dettori, the famed Italian jockey, is back to ride Society Man at age 53 after a 24-year absence.\n\nTrainer Todd Pletcher, who saddles Fierceness, is in the Kentucky Derby for the 24th year and it never gets old. He has won it twice.\n\n\"If anything, it just becomes more nerve-wracking,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "wishtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WISH-TV | Indianapolis News | Indiana Weather | Indiana Traffic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "beth_harris@wishtv.com", "name": "Beth Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forever_Young_(Alphaville_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forever Young (Alphaville song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phalanx (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Pilot_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet Pilot (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faultless", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faultless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bay (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2002 Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Repole", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Repole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_A._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben A.

McPeek looked at her and, with his other hand, held his index finger and thumb about three inches apart. That was his assessment of the margin of victory in one of the most dramatic Derbies in the 150-year history of the race.\n\nA three-horse photo finish, the first in the Derby since 1947, turned the 1 1/4-mile race into a withering battle of inches in the final strides. Nobody knew in real time who won -- Mystik Dan on the inside, or the hard-charging duo of Sierra Leone and Forever Young in the middle of the track. When the official order of finish was posted it evoked gasps and roars from the Churchill Downs crowd of 156,710, with Mystik Dan declared the winner by a nose over Sierra Leone in second and Forever Young third.\n\nMystik Dan's win was a significant upset at odds of 18-1, but the first career Derby win for McPeek and jockey Brian Hernandez nearly got away from them at the last second. Hernandez had gotten Mystik Dan clear in the stretch and was seemingly home free, driving for the finish line. Hernandez had no idea what was coming for him.\n\n\"Three jumps before the wire,\" he said, \"I didn't see them at all.\"\n\nThen the pursuers loomed alongside. Sierra Leone and Forever Young waged their own battle and evoked memories of the 1933 \"Fighting Finish\" Derby, in which the jockeys of Brokers Tip and Head Play engaged in literal hand-to-hand combat in the stretch. Sierra Leone jockey Tyler Gafflione reached out with his left hand to seemingly grab the saddle or reins of Forever Young as they dueled. In the end, they both came up agonizingly short.\n\nPast the wire, Hernandez thought he won but wasn't sure as Mystik Dan galloped out around the turn. The jockey asked an outrider if the result was official yet, but it wasn't.\n\n\"That was the longest two minutes in sports,\" Hernandez said. \"From the fastest two minutes (as the Derby is known) to the longest two minutes.\"\n\nAfter that brief eternity, the outrider got the news and relayed it to Hernandez: \"You just won the Kentucky Derby.\"\n\nThat moment capped an epic 25 hours for McPeek and Hernandez, who teamed up to win the Kentucky Oaks Friday with monster filly Thorpedo Anna. McPeek became the first trainer since 1952 to win that double, and Hernandez was the first jockey to do so since 2009. Neither man operates at the highest echelon of horse racing, but they stand astride the sport today.\n\nIn the days leading up to those races, McPeek radiated an almost outrageous confidence. \"It wouldn't surprise me if I won both,\" he said two weeks ago.\n\nThe Oaks unfolded largely as expected Friday, with 4-1 Thorpedo Anna (\"a grizzly,\" McPeek says) dominating. Then came the harder part Saturday.\n\nMcPeek arrived at his Churchill barn at 7:30 a.m. Saturday, opened the back of his Mercedes SUV to let out his dog, and greeted reporters with this line: \"Let's do it again tonight.\"\n\nAnd then they did, with Hernandez delivering a ride that was both smart and daring.\n\nThe 38-year-old Louisiana native, who rides regularly at Churchill, got Mystik Dan out of the gate cleanly and steered him from the No. 3 post quickly to the rail for a ground-saving trip. Hernandez kept Mystik Dan tucked into a pocket of clear ground, never farther back than eighth place, settling the colt into an easy stride. \"He was just cruising along so nicely and so comfortable,\" Hernandez said.\n\nFrom there, Hernandez drafted behind Track Phantom through the far turn. When Track Phantom drifted just a touch off the rail, Hernandez pounced. He urged Mystik Dan into the hole like a running back finding a sliver of daylight.\n\nJoel Rosario appeared to try to swerve Track Phantom back over to cut him off. The two horses bumped hips but Mystik Dan was undeterred -- he's a smaller horse but still powered through along the rail and cut the corner into the stretch, drawing clear.\n\n\"Brian gave us a huge opportunity because we saved ground, saved ground, saved ground,\" McPeek said. \"And when you look at that photo finish, I think we needed all of it to hold off the two second- and third-place horses.\"\n\nIt takes incredible nerve to urge a horse into a tight spot at high speed. But the Derby was on the line. It was a now-or-never moment and a spur-of-the-moment decision.\n\n\"We might have took out a little bit of the inside fence, but that's okay,\" Hernandez joked.\n\nHernandez had spent many years at Churchill learning from the master of the inside move, Calvin Borel, who won Derbies aboard Mine That Bird and Super Saver by hugging the rail. The shortest way around the track is as close to the rail as possible.\n\n\"As a young kid out of Louisiana, I got the privilege of sitting in the same corner (in the jockeys room) as Calvin Borel,\" Hernandez said. \"So I got to watch him ride those Derbies all those years. And today, with Mystik Dan being in the three\u2011hole, I watched a couple of his rides there between Super Saver and Mine That Bird. I said, 'You know what? We're going to roll the dice.'\"\n\nHernandez rolled sevens, Meanwhile, favored Fierceness rolled snake eyes -- getting a favorable trip and pace but fading badly in the stretch to finish 15th. Second choice Sierra Leone came running late, as expected, but couldn't collar Mystik Dan.\n\nSierra Leone was a $2.3 million yearling purchase, regally bred and seemingly destined for this moment. Mystik Dan was a homebred owned by Arkansas businessman Lance Gasaway, a former standout small-college wide receiver for the Arkansas-Monticello Boll Weevils who had never gotten a horse to the Derby before.\n\nAsked what he was going to do Saturday night to celebrate, Gasaway said, \"Probably drink a lot of alcohol.\"\n\nGasaway got into racing through his father, who died a year ago Saturday. His stable isn't lavish, but the decision -- informed by input from McPeek -- to breed their mare, Ma'am, to former Derby runner Goldencents proved to be the master stroke that produced Mystik Dan.\n\n\"This isn't some zillion-dollar operation,\" McPeek said. \"We didn't throw money at this. We thoughtfully went through it all, and it's amazing.\"\n\nThe 61-year-old McPeek has been around the sport for a long time, rising to within reach of winning a Derby in the 1990s. He finished second in 1995 with Tejano Run and had the 2001 favorite, Harlan's Holiday, who finished seventh. Meanwhile, the Lexington, Ky., product and University of Kentucky graduate dabbled in things like developing an app (Horse Races Now) for videos of races. He's always been a racing wonk who loves to talk about the inner workings of the sport.\n\n\"My grandfather took me to the races at Keeneland when I was boy,\" he said. \"Learned how to read a pedigree. Used to go to the Keeneland library and read about good horses. Went to [Kentucky] and found the [agriculture] library -- in the basement of the agriculture library, I read every thoroughbred and blood horse record ever printed when I was in college.\"\n\nHe's won some big races -- the 2002 Belmont, the 2020 Preakness, the Kentucky Oaks on Friday -- but the Derby had remained elusive. For a Kentuckian, that was tough. Now, he's reached the pinnacle.\n\nBy a matter of inches. The margin between making history and suffering a staggering defeat was that tiny. The three-horse photo finish in the 150th Kentucky Derby will be talked about in the sport for the next 150 years.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"},

Sent off at odds of 18-1, Mystik Dan made the turn for home in front and stayed on the rail with Forever Young just to his outside and Sierra Leone on the far outside.\n\nThere was a gasp from the crowd as the three colts hit the finish line. It took several minutes for the racing stewards to look at the finish line photo and declare Mystik Dan the winner.\n\n\"Those were the longest few minutes of my life,\" Hernandez said. \"To see your number flash up to win the Derby.\n\n\"I don't think it will sink in for a while.\"\n\nIt was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- which is the closest margin you can have in horse racing -- and it was the first nose decision since Grindstone edged out Cavonnier in the 1996 Derby.\n\n\"Brian Hernandez won this race today,\" trainer Kenny McPeek said. \"We certainly gave him the horse, but he won this race. What a great ride Brian gave this horse today.\" The win was the first Kentucky Derby for Hernandez and McPeek, who teamed up to win the Kentucky Oaks on Friday with Thorpedo Anna. It is the first time since 1952 that a trainer has swept both races in the same year when Ben Jones won them both and the first time a jockey has accomplished the feat since 2009 when Calvin Borel won both on the same weekend.\n\nMcPeek actually called his shot, two weeks ago saying, \"I really feel like I'm going to win them both.\"\n\nThe Lexington, Ky., native won them both ... but the Derby was in thrilling fashion.\n\n\"For three weeks, I've felt like we were going to win both races,\" McPeek said. \"I can't tell you why. Both horses have been easy to deal with, the team has done such a great job every day. There's been no drama.\n\n\"I just believe in mojo, in positive energy and we've had a lot of it.\"\n\nMcPeek, who was second in the 1995 Derby with Tejano Run, and Hernandez came into the weekend 0-for-33 in the Oaks and Derby races. The previous best finish for Hernandez was McCracken in eighth in 2017.\n\n\"It still hasn't sunk in, it's so unbelievable,\" Hernandez said. \"We came into the weekend thinking that we had a really big chance at winning both Friday and Saturday. For the horses to pull it off for us, we have to thank the guys back in the barn. It's definitely a surreal moment.\n\n\"The last 20 years I've ridden in Kentucky, and as a young kid out of Louisiana, I had the chance of sitting in the same corner as Calvin Borel. Watching him ride all those Derbys all those years, and today with Mystik Dan, being in the 3 hole, I watched a couple of his rides, with Super Saver and Mine That Bird, and I decided that we were going to roll the dice. We had the right kind of horse to give him that kind of trip.\"\n\nDerby favorite Fierceness, at 3-1, finished 15th in the 20-horse field.", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "West Hawaii Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "none@westhawaiitoday.com", "name": "none", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_A._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben A.

Not yet,\" McPeek said after the phone call. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. We skipped the Rebel (Stakes) because it was back too quick, as well. ... It'll be one of those (decisions) where we take it up to the last minute.\"\n\nMystik Dan did leave some feed in his tub Saturday night after winning a three-horse photo finish with runner-up Sierra Leone and third-place finisher Forever Young.\n\nCoupled with Thorpedo Anna's win in Friday's Kentucky Oaks, McPeek became the first trainer to execute the Oaks/Derby double since the legendary Ben Jones accomplished the feat for Calumet Farm in 1952.\n\n\"An overnight sensation, 40 years later,\" McPeek joked Sunday.\n\nSaturday was a win for the good guys. The 61-year-old McPeek is a Tates Creek High School and University of Kentucky graduate who admits he spent a good portion of his time in the library at the UK agricultural school pouring over the bloodline histories in the BloodHorse and the old Thoroughbred Record.\n\nHis first Kentucky Derby horse, Tejano Run, finished second in 1995. He won the 2002 Belmont with Sarava and the 2022 Preakness with the filly Swiss Skydiver. He was 0-for-9 in the Derby, however, including 2002 when he saddled the favorite, Harlan's Holiday. After a seventh-place finish, the owners moved the colt to a different trainer.\n\nMystik Dan was a different colt, however. Outside of the post-time favorite Fierceness, Mystik Dan had run the only triple-digit Beyer Speed Figure -- 101 for his 8-length win in the Grade 3 Southwest Stakes -- in the Derby field. Even a third-place finish in the Arkansas Derby didn't dampen McPeek's enthusiasm about his Derby chances.\n\n\"I've thought for three weeks he was going to win the race,\" he said Sunday. \"I had a calm about it. I just did.\"\n\nHe again credited the terrific ride from jockey Brian Hernandez, a regular on McPeek's horses. Out of the No. 3 post position, Hernandez guided Mystik Dan to victory along the Churchill rail. In fact, Hernandez's boots even sported rail paint to prove it.\n\n\"We don't win the race without the job that Brian did,\" McPeek said.\n\nThe Preakness is also a different deal. These days, connections rarely run their horses in races two weeks apart. After Mystik Dan broke his maiden with a win at Churchill Downs on Nov. 12, McPeek ran the colt back in an optional claiming race at Churchill on Nov. 25, where Mystik Dan finished fifth.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us,\" McPeek said. \"If he's not in the feed tub, he won't run. And he ran hard yesterday. So we'll see.\"\n\nForever Young and Sierra Leone won't be in Baltimore. Forever Young must return to his home country of Japan before May 15 or be quarantined for three months. Trainer Chad Brown said Sunday that Sierra Leone will be pointed toward the Belmont Stakes at Saratoga, where the race will be run at a mile-and-a-quarter while Belmont Park is under renovation.\n\nMcPeek is headed to Saratoga, as well. He said he will leave for New York on Monday to set up his barn at the historic track.\n\nAfter finally winning the Kentucky Derby, how hard would it be to not run Mystik Dan back in the Preakness?\n\n\"I don't think it would be hard,\" McPeek said. \"I'll talk to (the owners) and the team here and like I said, we're going to let the horse tell us. If I don't think he's right and ready, we'll just wait for the Belmont.\"\n\nOwner of Kentucky Derby 2024 winner Mystik Dan dedicates victory to his late father\n\n'I believe in mojo.'

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThat year, Jet Pilot won by a head over Phalanx and a length ahead of Faultless.\n\nThis one was much tighter.\n\nMystik Dan, an 18-1 shot, edged Sierra Leone by a nose, with Forever Young another nose back in third on Saturday. Sierra Leone was the most expensive horse in the race at $2.3 million.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nLong shots Track Phantom and Just Steel led the field through the early going, with 3-1 favorite Fierceness racing three-wide just off the leaders.\n\nAt the top of the stretch, everything changed.\n\nTrack Phantom drifted off the rail, opening a hole that Hernandez squeezed Mystik Dan through, and the bay colt suddenly found another gear. He quickly opened up a daylight advantage on the field.\n\n\"When he shot through that spot, he was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it,\" Hernandez said. \"He shot off and I'm like, 'Oh man, I've got a big chance to win the Kentucky Derby.'\"\n\nTo Mystik Dan's outside, Sierra Leone and Forever Young took up the chase in the middle of the track.\n\nAs Mystik Dan sped along the rail, Sierra Leone lugged in and bumped Forever Young three times in the stretch, but jockey Ryusei Sakai didn't claim foul.\n\nMystik Dan got so close to the rail that Hernandez's boot struck it.\n\n\"But I think we can buy another pair of boots,\" he said.\n\nThe winner's share of the record $5 million purse was $3.1 million, with the jockey and trainer typically earning 10% each.\n\n\"Just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey and ride,\" McPeek said. \"Brian is one of the most underrated jockeys, but not anymore, right?\"\n\nSierra Leone, the second choice at 9-2 odds, and Forever Young from Japan came up just short at the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs, the largest crowd since 2018.\n\n\"You get beat a nose in the Kentucky Derby, it's a tough one,\" said Chad Brown, trainer of Sierra Leone. \"But I'm so proud of the horse.\"\n\nIt was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- the closest margin in horse racing -- and the first since Grindstone edged Cavonnier to wear the garland of red roses in 1996.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe crowd waited several minutes in the heat and humidity as the result was reviewed by the stewards and declared official.\n\n\"The longest few minutes of my life,\" Hernandez said, after he and Mystik Dan walked in circles while the stunning result was settled. \"To see your number flash up to win the Derby, I don't think it will sink in for a while.\"\n\nFierceness finished 15th in the field of 20 3-year-olds. Owner Mike Repole is 0 for 8 in the derby. He had the favorite in 2011 with Uncle Mo, who was scratched the day before the race with an illness. Last year, Forte was scratched the morning of the race as the favorite with a bruised foot.\n\nMystik Dan ran 1 1/4 miles over a fast track in 2:03.34 and paid $39.22, $16.32 and $10.\n\nHernandez and trainer Kenny McPeek had teamed for a wire-to-wire win in the Kentucky Oaks for fillies on Friday with Thorpedo Anna. McPeek is the first trainer to sweep both races since Ben Jones in 1952.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMcPeek's only other victory in a Triple Crown race was also a shocker: 70-1 Sarava won the 2002 Belmont Stakes -- the biggest upset in that race's history. The colt spoiled the Triple Crown bid of War Emblem.\n\nThe winning owners are cousins Lance and Brent Gasaway and Daniel Hamby III, all from Arkansas. They bred Mystik Dan.\n\n\"We've done it with what I call working-class horse,\" McPeek said. \"His mother is a filly who raced hard, but wasn't well known. His father wasn't a big name, either.\"\n\nSharilyn Gasaway, Brent's wife, said, \"It is surreal for sure. We feel like we're just ordinary people and we've got an amazing horse.\"\n\nSierra Leone returned $6.54 and $4.64. Forever Young was another nose back in third and paid $5.58 to show.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nCatching Freedom was fourth, followed by T O Password of Japan, Resilience, Stronghold, Honor Marie and Endlessly. Dornoch was 10th and then came Track Phantom, West Saratoga, Domestic Product, Epic Ride, Fierceness, Society Man, Just Steel, Grand Mo the First, Catalytic and Just a Touch.\n\n___\n\nAP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forever_Young_(Alphaville_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forever Young (Alphaville song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phalanx (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Pilot_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet Pilot (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faultless", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faultless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bay (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Brown_(horse_trainer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chad Brown (horse trainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindstone_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grindstone (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2002 Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Repole", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Repole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_A._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben A.

While Fierceness and Sierra Leone came into Saturday as the top two favorites, it was Mystik Dan who won in a photo finish.\n\nIt wasn't a photo finish in a hyperbolic sense, either, as jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. held Mystik Dan in the lead by mere inches at the wire.\n\nIt was a stunning finish to an exciting race -- and the richest in the storied history of the Kentucky Derby. The total prize pool, which was raised to $3 million in 2019, jumped to a whopping $5 million this year.\n\nMystik Dan, who was trained by Kenny McPeek and opened with 20-1 morning-line odds, wasn't considered one of the early favorites. However, the horse, whose last win came at the Grade 3 Southwest Stakes in February, wasn't completely overlooked.\n\n\"A rail-skimming ride on Derby Day from a jockey who knows Churchill Downs well? It's happened before,\" Ben Robert of the Lexington Herald-Leader wrote before the race.\n\nThat's pretty much how things played out. Hernandez -- who also won Friday's Kentucky Oaks atop Thorpedo Anna -- moved in front and masterfully held inside positing down the stretch. He had to hold off late charges from Sierra Leone and Forever Young to seal the victory, but the veteran jockey pulled it off.\n\nThe late surge by Sierra Leone and jockey Tyler Gaffalione wasn't unexpected. The Chad Brown-trained horse is a strong closer and was always going to try to stalk for the victory. However, most expected Sierra Leone to be chasing the blazing-fast Fierceness down the stretch.\n\n\"On his best day, (Fierceness) is in a league of his own,\" Trainer Saffie Joseph said before the race, per Jason Frakes of the Louisville Courier Journal. \"Sierra Leone is a very good horse, too. Different running style. Those two horses are the standouts. After that, basically, it becomes wide open.\"\n\nWide open it was, and we nearly saw history, as Forever Young came within a few feet of becoming the first Japanese Horse to win the Kentucky Derby. T O Password, another Japanese mount, was the lone true dark horse to end up in the money.\n\nFierceness and jockey John Velazquez got the fast start for which they were hoping but faded dramatically near the end of the race to finish a disappointing 15th. Fierceness, of course, started from the 17th gate, a position that has still not produced a Derby winner.\n\nWhile Fierceness' disappointing run -- and perhaps his place in Derby superstition -- were part of the story on Saturday, but it's all about Mystik Dan and his team moving forward.\n\n\"Just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey and ride,\" McPeek said after the race, per Frakes. \"Probably one of the most underrated riders, but not anymore, right?\"\n\nThe question for McPeek, Hernandez and the rest of the team now is whether they'll continue pushing for the coveted Triple Crown. Mystik Dan did begin to fade before the finish line, and the final leg of the Triple Crown, the Belmont Stakes, is a quarter-mile longer than the Kentucky Derby.\n\nOf course, any decision on the Belmont can wait. The Preakness Stakes are up next and scheduled to take place on May 18.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristopher_knox@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Kristopher Knox", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Gaffalione", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Gaffalione"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Oaks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Oaks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graded stakes race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington_Herald-Leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lexington Herald-Leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_R._Velazquez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John R.

He did, too, after a delay of several minutes while the closest three-horse photo finish since 1947 was sorted out.\n\nThat year, Jet Pilot won by a head over Phalanx and a length ahead of Faultless.\n\nMystik Dan, an 18-1 shot, edged Sierra Leone by a nose, with Forever Young another nose back in third on Saturday.\n\nJockey Brian Hernandez Jr. squeezed Mystik Dan through a tight spot to reach the rail turning for home and the bay colt suddenly found another gear. He took off down the stretch and built a slight lead.\n\n\"When he shot through that spot, he was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it,\" Hernandez said. \"He shot off and I'm like, 'Oh man, I've got a big chance to win the Kentucky Derby.'\"\n\nMystik Dan got so close to the rail that Hernandez's boot struck it.\n\n\"But I think we can buy another pair of boots,\" he said.\n\nThe winner's share of the record $5 million purse was $3.1 million, with the jockey and trainer typically earning 10% each.\n\n\"Just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey and ride,\" McPeek said. \"Brian is one of the most underrated jockeys, but not anymore, right?\"\n\nSierra Leone, the second choice at 9-2 odds, and Forever Young from Japan gave chase and pressured the leader to the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs, the largest crowd since 2018.\n\nIt was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- the closest margin in horse racing -- and the first since Grindstone edged Cavonnier to wear the garland of red roses in 1996.\n\nThe crowd waited several minutes in the heat and humidity as the result was reviewed by the stewards and declared official.\n\n\"The longest few minutes of my life,\" Hernandez said, after he and Mystik Dan walked in circles while the stunning result was settled. \"To see your number flash up to win the Derby, I don't think it will sink in for a while.\"\n\nFierceness, the 3-1 favorite, finished 15th in the field of 20 3-year-olds. Owner Mike Repole is 0 for 8 in the derby. He had the favorite in 2011 with Uncle Mo, who was scratched the day before the race with an illness. Last year, Forte was scratched the morning of the race as the favorite with a bruised foot.\n\nMystik Dan ran 1 1/4 miles over a fast track in 2:03.34 and paid $39.22, $16.32 and $10.\n\nHernandez and trainer Kenny McPeek had teamed for a wire-to-wire win in the Kentucky Oaks for fillies on Friday with Thorpedo Anna. McPeek is the first trainer to sweep both races since Ben Jones in 1952.\n\nMcPeek's only other victory in a Triple Crown race was also a shocker: 70-1 Sarava won the 2002 Belmont Stakes -- the biggest upset in that race's history. The colt spoiled the Triple Crown bid of War Emblem.\n\nThe winning owners are cousins Lance and Brent Gasaway and Daniel Hamby III, all from Arkansas.\n\nSierra Leone returned $6.54 and $4.64. Forever Young was another nose back in third and paid $5.58 to show.\n\nSierra Leone lugged in and bumped Forever Young three times in the stretch, but jockey Ryusei Sakai didn't claim foul.\n\nCatching Freedom was fourth, followed by T O Password of Japan, Resilience, Stronghold, Honor Marie and Endlessly. Dornoch was 10th and then came Track Phantom, West Saratoga, Domestic Product, Epic Ride, Fierceness, Society Man, Just Steel, Grand Mo the First, Catalytic and Just a Touch.\n\nThe 150th Run for the Roses attracted more than 157,000 people from all over the world to Churchill Downs for a dayslong spectacle of huge hats and mint juleps, where most grandstand tickets cost more than $500, and celebrities celebrate in lavish suites high above the track.\n\nThe sun was shining Saturday, and Derby-goers didn't have to contend with the bad news that put a damper on the race last year, when seven horses died in the week leading into the race. They posed for pictures in front of a sign commemorating the anniversary and whispered about the celebrities who made an appearance.\n\nKentucky native Wynonna Judd was at the track to sing the National Anthem. Martha Stewart was the day's grand marshal, charged with saying \"Riders' Up!\" to start race. Travis Kelce, three-time Super Bowl champion and Taylor Swift's boyfriend, comedian Jimmy Fallon and musician Kid Rock were also at the track.\n\nPatrons jockeyed to watch the horses get saddled at the track's renovated new paddock, now a massive horseshoe-shaped space at the foot of the famous Twin Spires.\n\nMary and Skip Keopnick weren't sure they were going to like the changes, but they said they were pleasantly surprised. They have a room in their Michigan home devoted to the Derby that features old hats and memorabilia from their decades in attendance.\n\nSkip Keopnick attended his first Derby in 1977 and hasn't missed one since. In the years since, he has seen a lot change. Women have always worn big hats, he said, but the men have finally caught up, often sporting bright, patterned suit jackets.\n\nHe fashioned a helmet years ago -- with a motor and a gear system -- that spins two horses around the top of his head. For the 150th Derby, he said, he made the motor bigger and the gear taller so the plastic horses on his head could run around faster. His wife had a floor-length dress screen-printed to read \"Kentucky Derby 150th.\"\n\n\"It's a milestone,\" he said. \"We had to do it up bigger than usual.\"", "source": {"uri": "troyrecord.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Record"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forever_Young_(Alphaville_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forever Young (Alphaville song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phalanx (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Pilot_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet Pilot (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faultless", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faultless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bay (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2002 Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Repole", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Repole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_A._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben A.

(AP) -- The 150th Kentucky Derby produced one of the most dramatic finishes in its storied history -- three noses at the wire.\n\nMystik Dan desperately fought to hang on with two challengers coming to him in the closing strides. He did, too, after a delay of several minutes while the closest three-horse photo finish since 1947 was sorted out.\n\nThat year, Jet Pilot won by a head over Phalanx and a length ahead of Faultless.\n\nMystik Dan, an 18-1 shot, edged Sierra Leone by a nose, with Forever Young another nose back in third on Saturday.\n\nJockey Brian Hernandez Jr. squeezed Mystik Dan through a tight spot to reach the rail turning for home and the bay colt suddenly found another gear. He took off down the stretch and built a slight lead.\n\n\"When he shot through that spot, he was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it,\" Hernandez said. \"He shot off and I'm like, 'Oh man, I've got a big chance to win the Kentucky Derby.'\"\n\nMystik Dan got so close to the rail that Hernandez's boot struck it.\n\n\"But I think we can buy another pair of boots,\" he said.\n\nThe winner's share of the record $5 million purse was $3.1 million, with the jockey and trainer typically earning 10% each.\n\n\"Just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey and ride,\" McPeek said. \"Brian is one of the most underrated jockeys, but not anymore, right?\"\n\nSierra Leone, the second choice at 9-2 odds, and Forever Young from Japan gave chase and pressured the leader to the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs, the largest crowd since 2018.\n\nIt was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- the closest margin in horse racing -- and the first since Grindstone edged Cavonnier to wear the garland of red roses in 1996.\n\nToday's Top Headlines A Charleston man went missing in Mexico a month ago.

The colt spoiled the Triple Crown bid of War Emblem.\n\nThe winning owners are cousins Lance and Brent Gasaway and Daniel Hamby III, all from Arkansas.\n\nSierra Leone returned $6.54 and $4.64. Forever Young was another nose back in third and paid $5.58 to show.\n\nSierra Leone lugged in and bumped Forever Young three times in the stretch, but jockey Ryusei Sakai didn't claim foul.\n\nCatching Freedom was fourth, followed by T O Password of Japan, Resilience, Stronghold, Honor Marie and Endlessly.

The key? One great ride.", "body": "Jockey Brian Hernandez delivered one of the great human performances in the history of the Kentucky Derby. Mystik Dan wasn't too bad, either.\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. -- There would have been a fleeting moment nearly three decades ago, participating in his first Kentucky Derby, when Kenny McPeek thought he might just win it. He was just 32 years old back then, barely starting to crack the top echelon of the sport, and a horse named Tejano Run -- the first big horse he had in his barn -- was flying through the stretch.\n\nUltimately, Tejano Run came up just short to Thunder Gulch. McPeek, a young and confident trainer, figured it was just the beginning.\n\n\"If I thought it would take me this long to knock it down...\" he said, his voice trailing off Saturday night. \"I thought I'd do it before today.\"\n\nBut in the 29 years since, McPeek has won a ton of races and learned a lot of lessons. One of them, of course, is that winning the Derby is really, really hard: None of his next eight Derby runners even hit the board.\n\nHe learned another lesson, too: It doesn't take a superstar jockey to give a horse a great ride.\n\nWith a rail-skimming ride that was practically perfect in its boldness and timing, Hernandez got 18-1 shot Mystik Dan home by a whisker over the surging Sierra Leone and Forever Young in a three-horse photo finish that left the Churchill Downs crowd of 156,710 initially wondering who had won America's most famous horse race.\n\n\"(Hernandez) was the difference in winning and losing today, for sure,\" McPeek said.\n\nThough McPeek's career has progressed from his first Derby in 1995 to the point where he was operating one of the top 20 stables in the country on a regular basis -- including a Preakness and Belmont victory -- he's never had a weekend like this one.\n\nOn Friday, he and Hernandez dominated the Kentucky Oaks with front-running Thorpedo Anna. A mere 24 hours later, they pulled a Derby shocker with a humbly bred colt who shot to the lead coming off the final turn and needed every inch of ground Hernandez was able to save to get his nose on the wire first.\n\n\"Three jumps before the wire I didn't see (the other horses) at all,\" Hernandez said. \"And right at the wire they surged late and I was like, 'Did we win the Kentucky Derby?' That was the longest two minutes waiting. From the fastest two minutes to the longest.\"\n\nThe end result is that Hernandez is the first jockey to win the Oaks-Derby double since Calvin Borel in 2009, and McPeek is the first trainer to do it since 1952, making him a cinch to one day enter the horse racing Hall of Fame.\n\n\"For three weeks I felt like we were going to win both races,\" McPeek said. \"I can't tell you why. Both horses have been so easy to deal with, the team has done such a great job every day. I believe in mojo and positive energy, and we had a lot of that.\"\n\nThough Hernandez has spent a couple of decades riding the Kentucky circuit, Mystik Dan was just his fifth mount in the Derby -- a number that suggests he's never been considered among the top tier of riders.\n\nBut about seven or eight years ago, he started riding a lot of horses for McPeek, who appreciated his professionalism and the solid work he would put in day after day. He didn't have to beg Hernandez or his agent to get on his horses, scheduling conflicts were resolved easily and he rarely found himself second-guessing a ride.\n\n\"It's business, business, business with no drama,\" McPeek said. \"I like no drama, especially the older I get. But more than anything, I put Brian on horses on a daily basis -- good horses and average horses -- and he does a good job on every one of them. Then I'll get outside the box and go to Saratoga and ride some other riders and go, 'Boy, I miss Brian because he doesn't make many mistakes.'\n\n\"I don't want anybody to know how good Brian is, but I guess the cat's out of the bag.\"\n\nDERBY PAYOUTS: Complete betting results after Mystik Dan's win\n\nIn February, Mystik Dan stamped himself as a possible Derby horse with an eight-length victory in the Southwest Stakes at Oaklawn Park, the home track of Arkansas-based owners Lance and Sherilyn Gasaway.\n\nBut after a bit of a disappointing third-place finish in the Arkansas Derby, Mystik Dan was slightly forgotten in the Derby lead-up while most of the attention went to horses like Fierceness and Sierra Leone.\n\nWhen Mystik Dan drew the No. 3 post position, assuring a rail trip would be his likely way through the field, Hernandez went to the film room to watch Calvin Borel, a fellow south Louisiana native he got to know when he first arrived in Kentucky with big hopes and dreams.\n\nBorel -- nicknamed Bo-rail due to his affinity for hugging the inside lane -- won the Derby three times with Street Sense (2007), Mine That Bird (2009) and Super Saver (2010). All three times, he came through on the rail with a burst of speed that proved decisive in victory.\n\n\"I was like, 'I'm going to roll the dice,' \" Hernandez said. \"Kenny trusts me to do things like that. We thought we had the right kind of horse to give him that kind of trip.\"\n\nAs the race unfolded, Hernandez was able to establish position just behind the leaders -- including 3-1 favorite Fierceness -- who were setting a pretty fast pace with a 46.63-second half-mile.\n\nAs the field approached the quarter-pole, Hernandez guided Mystik Dan right on the heels of long-shot Track Phantom, waiting for an opening to develop. Then, as the horses came off the turn, Track Phantom drifted out and Hernandez immediately signaled to Mystik Dan that it was time to go.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, he cut the corner and opened up a couple-length lead on the field as Track Phantom, Fierceness and the rest of that leading pack began to tire.\n\n\"We might have took out a little of the inside fence, but that's OK,\" Hernandez said. \"I was just smiling the whole time. It's an amazing feeling when you are on the horse under you and you know they're going to go forward.\"\n\nMeanwhile, another battle was happening behind Mystik Dan. Sierra Leone and the Japanese entrant, Forever Young, began to move in tandem. Through the stretch, they appeared to make contact several times -- though it wasn't entirely clear which horse was at fault -- but were still gaining on Mystik Dan with every stride.\n\nIn retrospect, that probably made the difference given the razor-thin margin.\n\n\"I had a hard time keeping him straight,\" said Sierra Leone's jockey, Tyler Gaffalione. \"That definitely cost us.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the crowd gasped as the horses hit the wire, unsure who had actually won the race.

(AP) - The second jewel of horse racing's Triple Crown could be missing 150th Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and other co-stars, quashing hopes for a rematch after the thrilling three-wide photo finish in the milestone race.\n\nTrainer Kenny McPeek and the horse's ownership wouldn't commit to whether the colt would race in the 149th Preakness on May 18 in Baltimore, which requires a quick two-week turnaround. Mystik Dan will travel to Saratoga, New York, before they decide whether to enter him in the 1 3/16 mile Preakness.\n\n\"We\u00b4re not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek said Sunday morning outside his barn on Churchill Downs' back side. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. ... So, we\u00b4ll just watch him over the next week. It\u00b4ll be one of those (situations) where we\u00b4ll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We\u00b4ll let him tell us.\"\n\nThe picturesque track in upstate New York will host the Triple Crown's final jewel for the next three years while Belmont Park is being reconstructed. The Belmont has also been shortened to a 1 1/4 mile, matching the Derby distance that Mystik Dan won by a nose over Sierra Leone and Japan-bred Forever Young in the closest three-way finish since 1947.\n\nThe five-week gap follows a more normal race schedule for many thoroughbreds and some trainers might opt to head to Saratoga to acclimate horses sooner.\n\nBrian Hernandez Jr. rides Mystik Dan, top right, to the finish line to win the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race at Churchill Downs Saturday, May 4, 2024, in Louisville, Ky. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)\n\nChad Brown said Sierra Leone will skip the Preakness and leave on Monday to train at Saratoga and run the Belmont. Considering how much it took for Sierra Leone to navigate other horses and chase down Mystik Dan before falling a nose short at the wire, rest sounds necessary.\n\n\"He\u00b4s a real laid back horse but when we brought him out, was a little more tired than he normally is after his races,\" Brown said. \"I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nLouisville-born trainer Brad Cox is watching Catching Freedom (fourth) and Just A Touch (20th) before deciding their next steps. Forever Young and fellow Japan-bred T O Password (fifth) are headed home on Tuesday.\n\nThat could leave the Preakness without some Derby star power at first glance, though it won't lack for plotlines with a number of well-rested horses expected to compete at Pimlico Race Course.\n\nHall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert could have two entrants as he seeks to follow up National Treasure's victory there last spring. He trains Santa Anita Derby runner-up Imagination and Arkansas Derby winner Muth, who missed the Derby after failed legal attempts by owner Amr Zedan to get him in despite Baffert's suspension by Churchill Downs through the end of 2024.\n\nAs McPeek and the owners ponder a decision, he and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. basked in a wash of congratulations for a Derby victory that put them in exclusive company.\n\nSaturday's win helped both claim rare weekend sweeps of the Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies. McPeek is just the third trainer to do that and first since Ben Jones (who did it twice) in 1952, while Hernandez is the eighth rider to achieve the feat and first since fellow Louisiana native and Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Mystik Dan just stood calm and unfazed as a cluster of onlookers took photos and selfies as workers bathed him outside the barn. He was then draped with the winner's blanket signifying his Derby win before being led back to his stall with a WWE-style title belt laying on an outer wall. Oaks-winning filly Thorpedo Anna also made a brief appearance and soaked in the attention.\n\nHernandez is preparing for his own life-changing spotlight and title after claiming the sport's marquee race. He dined with his family after the Derby but didn't sleep much, a routine that figures to go on for the next few days amid a flood of interview requests. At some point he hopes to get his mind around all that has happened, but he already has a response ready.\n\n\"When somebody asks what my profession is, I\u00b4m able to tell them I\u00b4m a professional jockey. And then the first question they normally ask is, 'Have you ever won the Kentucky Derby?\u00b4 I can say that now.\"\n\nAP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing\n\nTrainer Kenneth McPeek, right, hand off the trophy to jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. as Hernandez celebrates in the winner's circle after riding Mystik Dan to win the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race at Churchill Downs Saturday, May 4, 2024, in Louisville, Ky.

(AP) -- The 150th Kentucky Derby produced one of the most dramatic finishes in its storied history -- three noses at the wire.\n\nMystik Dan desperately fought to hang on with two challengers coming to him in the closing strides. He did, too, after a delay of several minutes while the closest three-horse photo finish since 1947 was sorted out.\n\nThat year, Jet Pilot won by a head over Phalanx, who was another head in front of Faultless.\n\nThis one was much tighter.\n\nMystik Dan, an 18-1 shot, edged Sierra Leone by a nose, with Forever Young another nose back in third on Saturday.

He quickly opened up a daylight advantage on the field.\n\n\"When he shot through that spot, he was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it,\" Hernandez said. \"He shot off and I'm like, 'Oh man, I've got a big chance to win the Kentucky Derby.'\"\n\nTo Mystik Dan's outside, Sierra Leone and Forever Young took up the chase in the middle of the track.\n\nAs Mystik Dan sped along the rail, Sierra Leone lugged in and bumped Forever Young three times in the stretch, but jockey Ryusei Sakai didn't claim foul.\n\nMystik Dan got so close to the rail that Hernandez's boot struck it.\n\n\"But I think we can buy another pair of boots,\" he said.\n\nThe winner's share of the record $5 million purse was $3.1 million, with the jockey and trainer typically earning 10% each.\n\n\"Just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey and ride,\" McPeek said. \"Brian is one of the most underrated jockeys, but not anymore, right?\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nSierra Leone, the second choice at 9-2 odds, and Forever Young from Japan came up just short at the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs, the largest crowd since 2018.\n\n\"You get beat a nose in the Kentucky Derby, it's a tough one,\" said Chad Brown, trainer of Sierra Leone. \"But I'm so proud of the horse.\"\n\nIt was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- the closest margin in horse racing -- and the first since Grindstone edged Cavonnier to wear the garland of red roses in 1996.\n\nThe crowd waited several minutes in the heat and humidity as the result was reviewed by the stewards and declared official.\n\n\"The longest few minutes of my life,\" Hernandez said, after he and Mystik Dan walked in circles while the stunning result was settled. \"To see your number flash up to win the Derby, I don't think it will sink in for a while.\"\n\nFierceness finished 15th in the field of 20 3-year-olds. Owner Mike Repole is 0 for 8 in the derby. He had the favorite in 2011 with Uncle Mo, who was scratched the day before the race with an illness. Last year, Forte was scratched the morning of the race as the favorite with a bruised foot.\n\nMystik Dan ran 1 1/4 miles over a fast track in 2:03.34 and paid $39.22, $16.32 and $10.\n\nHernandez and trainer Kenny McPeek had teamed for a wire-to-wire win in the Kentucky Oaks for fillies on Friday with Thorpedo Anna. McPeek is the first trainer to sweep both races since Ben Jones in 1952.\n\nMcPeek's only other victory in a Triple Crown race was also a shocker: 70-1 Sarava won the 2002 Belmont Stakes -- the biggest upset in that race's history. The colt spoiled the Triple Crown bid of War Emblem.\n\nThe winning owners are cousins Lance and Brent Gasaway and Daniel Hamby III, all from Arkansas. They bred Mystik Dan.\n\n\"We've done it with what I call working-class horse,\" McPeek said, explaining the colt's sire and dam weren't big names.\n\nSharilyn Gasaway, Brent's wife, said, \"It is surreal for sure. We feel like we're just ordinary people and we've got an amazing horse.\"\n\nSierra Leone returned $6.54 and $4.64. Forever Young was another nose back in third and paid $5.58 to show.\n\nCatching Freedom was fourth, followed by T O Password of Japan, Resilience, Stronghold, Honor Marie and Endlessly. Dornoch was 10th and then came Track Phantom, West Saratoga, Domestic Product, Epic Ride, Fierceness, Society Man, Just Steel, Grand Mo the First, Catalytic and Just a Touch.\n\nAP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

We're going to roll the dice.'\"\n\nDelivering a \"Calvin Bo-Rail\" special, Hernandez made a bold move along the rail in the final turn that, ultimately, allowed Mystik Dan to get through to the lead and save just enough ground to prevail at the wire in a scintillating three-horse charge to the finish with Sierra Leone and Forever Young.\n\nWith a Churchill Downs crowed of 156,710 roaring, the three horses crossed the finish line almost locked in stride.\n\nUltimately, a photo finish showed Mystik Dan a nose ahead of Sierra Leone, who was a nose ahead of third-place Forever Young, the previously unbeaten Japanese horse. The winning time was 2:03.34.\n\nThe three-way photo to determine the victor was the first in a Kentucky Derby since 1947. It was a finish worthy of the 150th renewal of North America's marquee horse race -- and the ride by Hernandez proved every bit worthy of such a historic moment.\n\nOnce Mystik Dan claimed the lead entering the stretch, Hernandez said he had his head down, riding, and did not realize until the final jumps of the race that there were closers to his horse's outside charging hard to take the Kentucky Derby away.\n\nOnce the finish line had been crossed, Hernandez said he asked an outrider if Mystik Dan had won. The reply was probably, but it was not certain pending the photo.\n\nThe wait for Derby certainty \"was the longest two minutes of my life,\" Hernandez said.\n\nThe victory by trainer Kenny McPeek's Mystik Dan made Hernandez a Kentucky Derby champion in his fifth try at the race. In four previous Derbys, Hernandez had not finished better than eighth.\n\n\"It's unbelievable,\" Hernandez said. \"It still hasn't sunk in yet.\"\n\nEleven years ago, the 38-year-old Hernandez had another signature moment on one of horse racing's grandest stages. On the jockey's 27th birthday, he guided Fort Larned to victory in the 2012 Breeders' Cup Classic at Santa Anita.\n\nYet, for whatever reason, that victory did not elevate Hernandez's career to the elite level of racing.\n\nToiling mostly on the Kentucky racing circuit, Hernandez's great patron became McPeek. The trainer, a Tates Creek High School and University of Kentucky graduate, has long given Hernandez chances on his best horses. In 2021, Hernandez won four stakes races at Keeneland -- all on horses trained by McPeek.\n\n\"Well, the older you get, I don't get enamored with all the, I guess you could say, big-namers,\" McPeek said of more famous jockeys. \"With Brian and his agent (Frank Bernis), there's nothing complicated about either one of them. It's all business, business, business -- and there's no drama. And I like 'no drama.'\"\n\nOn Saturday, Hernandez repaid McPeek's faith.\n\nThe key point in the race came in the final turn. A tiring Track Phantom drifted out slightly. Hernandez asked Mystik Dan to push through a small hole along the rail.\n\n\"When I called upon him to hit that spot that I needed right before we straightened, to kind of get a little separation on the deep, deep closers, he did it,\" Hernandez said of Mystik Dan. \"He jumped off quickly and we were able to get that separation, and that made the difference of them not getting to him (at) the wire.\"\n\nAs the winning jockey in Kentucky Derby 150, Hernandez etched his name in race lore.\n\nHe joins Oliver Lewis (first Derby in 1875), J.D. Mooney (50th Derby in 1924) and Angel Cordero Jr. (100th Run for the Roses in 1974) as the winning jockeys in numerically significant Kentucky Derbys.\n\nIt was the weekend of a lifetime for the McPeek-Hernandez duo. The jockey and trainer also combined to win Friday's Kentucky Oaks with Thorpedo Anna.\n\nThat makes Hernandez the eighth jockey all-time to win the Kentucky Derby and the Kentucky Oaks in the same year. He is the first to do so since -- you guessed it -- Borel (Rachel Alexandra in the Oaks, Mine That Bird in the Derby) in 2009.\n\nAll it took for Hernandez to win the Kentucky Derby and put his name on several historic lists was a daring move along the rail that would have done Borel proud.\n\nSaid McPeek: \"Brian, his ride, was the difference today in winning.\"\n\nMystik Dan wins historic 2024 Kentucky Derby in three-way photo finish at Churchill Downs\n\nSee the best photos, videos from 2024 Kentucky Derby: Mystik Dan's win, fashion, celebrities\n\nKentucky Derby 2024 complete order of finish and payoffs at Churchill Downs\n\n'I believe in mojo.'

The key? One great ride.", "body": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- There would have been a fleeting moment nearly three decades ago, participating in his first Kentucky Derby, when Kenny McPeek thought he might just win it. He was just 32 years old back then, barely starting to crack the top echelon of the sport, and a horse named Tejano Run -- the first big horse he had in his barn -- was flying through the stretch.\n\nUltimately, Tejano Run came up just short to Thunder Gulch. McPeek, a young and confident trainer, figured it was just the beginning.\n\n\"If I thought it would take me this long to knock it down...\" he said, his voice trailing off Saturday night. \"I thought I'd do it before today.\"\n\nBut in the 29 years since, McPeek has won a ton of races and learned a lot of lessons. One of them, of course, is that winning the Derby is really, really hard: None of his next eight Derby runners even hit the board.\n\nHe learned another lesson, too: It doesn't take a superstar jockey to give a horse a great ride.\n\nAnd on Saturday, in the 150th Kentucky Derby, 38-year-old journeyman Brian Hernandez delivered one of the great human performances in the history of the race.\n\nAnd the horse he rode wasn't too bad, either.\n\nWith a rail-skimming ride that was practically perfect in its boldness and timing, Hernandez got 18-1 shot Mystik Dan home by a whisker over the surging Sierra Leone and Forever Young in a three-horse photo finish that left the Churchill Downs crowd of 156,710 initially wondering who had won America's most famous horse race.\n\n\"(Hernandez) was the difference in winning and losing today, for sure,\" McPeek said.\n\nThough McPeek's career has progressed from his first Derby in 1995 to the point where he was operating one of the top 20 stables in the country on a regular basis -- including a Preakness and Belmont victory -- he's never had a weekend like this one.\n\nOn Friday, he and Hernandez dominated the Kentucky Oaks with front-running Thorpedo Anna. A mere 24 hours later, they pulled a Derby shocker with a humbly bred colt who shot to the lead coming off the final turn and needed every inch of ground Hernandez was able to save to get his nose on the wire first.\n\n\"Three jumps before the wire I didn't see (the other horses) at all,\" Hernandez said. \"And right at the wire they surged late and I was like, 'Did we win the Kentucky Derby?' That was the longest two minutes waiting. From the fastest two minutes to the longest.\"\n\nThe end result is that Hernandez is the first jockey to win the Oaks-Derby double since Calvin Borel in 2009, and McPeek is the first trainer to do it since 1952, making him a cinch to one day enter the horse racing Hall of Fame.\n\n\"For three weeks I felt like we were going to win both races,\" McPeek said. \"I can't tell you why. Both horses have been so easy to deal with, the team has done such a great job every day. I believe in mojo and positive energy, and we had a lot of that.\"\n\nThough Hernandez has spent a couple of decades riding the Kentucky circuit, Mystik Dan was just his fifth mount in the Derby -- a number that suggests he's never been considered among the top tier of riders.\n\nBut about seven or eight years ago, he started riding a lot of horses for McPeek, who appreciated his professionalism and the solid work he would put in day after day. He didn't have to beg Hernandez or his agent to get on his horses, scheduling conflicts were resolved easily and he rarely found himself second-guessing a ride.\n\n\"It's business, business, business with no drama,\" McPeek said. \"I like no drama, especially the older I get. But more than anything, I put Brian on horses on a daily basis -- good horses and average horses -- and he does a good job on every one of them. Then I'll get outside the box and go to Saratoga and ride some other riders and go, 'Boy, I miss Brian because he doesn't make many mistakes.'\n\n\"I don't want anybody to know how good Brian is, but I guess the cat's out of the bag.\"\n\nIn February, Mystik Dan stamped himself as a possible Derby horse with an eight-length victory in the Southwest Stakes at Oaklawn Park, the home track of Arkansas-based owners Lance and Sherilyn Gasaway.\n\nBut after a bit of a disappointing third-place finish in the Arkansas Derby, Mystik Dan was slightly forgotten in the Derby lead-up while most of the attention went to horses like Fierceness and Sierra Leone.\n\nWhen Mystik Dan drew the No. 3 post position, assuring a rail trip would be his likely way through the field, Hernandez went to the film room to watch Calvin Borel, a fellow south Louisiana native he got to know when he first arrived in Kentucky with big hopes and dreams.\n\nBorel -- nicknamed Bo-rail due to his affinity for hugging the inside lane -- won the Derby three times with Street Sense (2007), Mine That Bird (2009) and Super Saver (2010). All three times, he came through on the rail with a burst of speed that proved decisive in victory.\n\n\"I was like, 'I'm going to roll the dice,' \" Hernandez said. \"Kenny trusts me to do things like that. We thought we had the right kind of horse to give him that kind of trip.\"\n\nAs the race unfolded, Hernandez was able to establish position just behind the leaders -- including 3-1 favorite Fierceness -- who were setting a pretty fast pace with a 46.63-second half-mile.\n\nAs the field approached the quarter-pole, Hernandez guided Mystik Dan right on the heels of long-shot Track Phantom, waiting for an opening to develop. Then, as the horses came off the turn, Track Phantom drifted out and Hernandez immediately signaled to Mystik Dan that it was time to go.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, he cut the corner and opened up a couple-length lead on the field as Track Phantom, Fierceness and the rest of that leading pack began to tire.\n\n\"We might have took out a little of the inside fence, but that's OK,\" Hernandez said. \"I was just smiling the whole time. It's an amazing feeling when you are on the horse under you and you know they're going to go forward.\"\n\nMeanwhile, another battle was happening behind Mystik Dan. Sierra Leone and the Japanese entrant, Forever Young, began to move in tandem. Through the stretch, they appeared to make contact several times -- though it wasn't entirely clear which horse was at fault -- but were still gaining on Mystik Dan with every stride.\n\nIn retrospect, that probably made the difference given the razor-thin margin.\n\n\"I had a hard time keeping him straight,\" said Sierra Leone's jockey, Tyler Gaffalione. \"That definitely cost us.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the crowd gasped as the horses hit the wire, unsure who had actually won the race. Chad Brown, the trainer of Sierra Leone, thought it might have been a dead-heat. McPeek felt like he had won the race in real time and was even more confident when he saw a slow-motion replay on a monitor in his box.\n\nAfter the trophy ceremony, he finally had a chance to watch the whole race, having finally captured the Derby he had been chasing since 1995. The analysis was shockingly simple.\n\n\"Great ride,\" he said. \"Great ride.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [],

He did, too, after a delay of several minutes while the closest three-horse photo finish since 1947 was sorted out.\n\nThat year, Jet Pilot won by a head over Phalanx and a length ahead of Faultless.\n\nMystik Dan, an 18-1 shot, edged Sierra Leone by a nose, with Forever Young another nose back in third on Saturday. Sierra Leone was the most expensive horse in the race at $2.3 million.\n\nLong shots Track Phantom and Just Steel led the field through the early going, with 3-1 favorite Fierceness racing three-wide just off the leaders.\n\nAt the top of the stretch, everything changed.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He quickly opened up a daylight advantage on the field.\n\n\"When he shot through that spot, he was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it,\" Hernandez said. \"He shot off and I'm like, 'Oh man, I've got a big chance to win the Kentucky Derby.'\"\n\nTo Mystik Dan's outside, Sierra Leone and Forever Young took up the chase in the middle of the track.\n\nAs Mystik Dan sped along the rail, Sierra Leone lugged in and bumped Forever Young three times in the stretch, but jockey Ryusei Sakai didn't claim foul.\n\nMystik Dan got so close to the rail that Hernandez's boot struck it.\n\n\"But I think we can buy another pair of boots,\" he said.\n\nThe winner's share of the record $5 million purse was $3.1 million, with the jockey and trainer typically earning 10% each.\n\n\"Just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey and ride,\" McPeek said. \"Brian is one of the most underrated jockeys, but not anymore, right?\"\n\nSierra Leone, the second choice at 9-2 odds, and Forever Young from Japan came up just short at the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs, the largest crowd since 2018.\n\nIt was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- the closest margin in horse racing -- and the first since Grindstone edged Cavonnier to wear the garland of red roses in 1996.\n\nThe crowd waited several minutes in the heat and humidity as the result was reviewed by the stewards and declared official.\n\n\"The longest few minutes of my life,\" Hernandez said, after he and Mystik Dan walked in circles while the stunning result was settled. \"To see your number flash up to win the Derby, I don't think it will sink in for a while.\"\n\nFierceness finished 15th in the field of 20 3-year-olds. Owner Mike Repole is 0 for 8 in the derby. He had the favorite in 2011 with Uncle Mo, who was scratched the day before the race with an illness. Last year, Forte was scratched the morning of the race as the favorite with a bruised foot.\n\nMystik Dan ran 1 1/4 miles over a fast track in 2:03.34 and paid $39.22, $16.32 and $10.\n\nHernandez and trainer Kenny McPeek had teamed for a wire-to-wire win in the Kentucky Oaks for fillies on Friday with Thorpedo Anna. McPeek is the first trainer to sweep both races since Ben Jones in 1952.\n\nMcPeek's only other victory in a Triple Crown race was also a shocker: 70-1 Sarava won the 2002 Belmont Stakes -- the biggest upset in that race's history. The colt spoiled the Triple Crown bid of War Emblem.\n\nThe winning owners are cousins Lance and Brent Gasaway and Daniel Hamby III, all from Arkansas. They bred Mystik Dan.\n\n\"We've done it with what I call working-class horse,\" McPeek said. \"His mother is a filly who raced hard, but wasn't well known. His father wasn't a big name, either.\"\n\nSharilyn Gasaway, Brent's wife, said, \"It is surreal for sure. We feel like we're just ordinary people and we've got an amazing horse.\"\n\nSierra Leone returned $6.54 and $4.64. Forever Young was another nose back in third and paid $5.58 to show.\n\nCatching Freedom was fourth, followed by T O Password of Japan, Resilience, Stronghold, Honor Marie and Endlessly. Dornoch was 10th and then came Track Phantom, West Saratoga, Domestic Product, Epic Ride, Fierceness, Society Man, Just Steel, Grand Mo the First, Catalytic and Just a Touch.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Sports Equestrian Sports Zoology Armed Forces Trade Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!

Mystik Dan will travel to Saratoga, New York, before they decide whether to enter him in the 1 3/16 mile Preakness.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" Mr. McPeek said Sunday morning outside his barn on Churchill Downs' back side. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. ... So, we'll just watch him over the next week. It'll be one of those [situations] where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nThe picturesque track in upstate New York will host the Triple Crown's final jewel for the next three years while Belmont Park is being reconstructed. The Belmont has also been shortened to 1 1/4 mile, matching the Derby distance that Mystik Dan won by a nose over Sierra Leone and Japan-bred Forever Young in the closest three-way finish since 1947.\n\nThe five-week gap follows a more normal race schedule for many thoroughbreds, and some trainers might opt to head to Saratoga to acclimate horses sooner.\n\nChad Brown said Sierra Leone will skip the Preakness and leave on Monday to train at Saratoga and run the Belmont. Considering how much it took for Sierra Leone to navigate other horses and chase down Mystik Dan before falling a nose short at the wire, rest sounds necessary.\n\n\"He's a real laid-back horse but when we brought him out, was a little more tired than he normally is after his races,\" Mr. Brown said. \"I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nLouisville-born trainer Brad Cox is watching Catching Freedom (fourth) and Just A Touch (20th) before deciding their next steps. Forever Young and fellow Japan-bred T O Password (fifth) are headed home on Tuesday.\n\nThat could leave the Preakness without some Derby star power at first glance, though it won't lack for plotlines with a number of well-rested horses expected to compete at Pimlico Race Course.\n\nHall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert could have two entrants as he seeks to follow up National Treasure's victory there last spring. He trains Santa Anita Derby runner-up Imagination and Arkansas Derby winner Muth, who missed the Kentucky Derby after failed legal attempts by owner Amr Zedan to get him in despite Mr. Baffert's suspension by Churchill Downs through the end of 2024.\n\nAs Mr. McPeek and the owners ponder a decision, he and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. basked in a wash of congratulations for a Derby victory that put them in exclusive company.\n\nSaturday's win helped both claim rare weekend sweeps of the Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies. Mr. McPeek is just the third trainer to do that and first since Ben Jones (who did it twice) in 1952, while Hernandez is the eighth rider to achieve the feat and first since fellow Louisiana native and Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Mystik Dan just stood calm and unfazed as a cluster of onlookers took photos and selfies as workers bathed him outside the barn. He was then draped with the winner's blanket signifying his Derby win before being led back to his stall with a WWE-style title belt laying on an outer wall. Oaks-winning filly Thorpedo Anna also made a brief appearance and soaked in the attention.\n\nHernandez is preparing for his own life-changing spotlight and title after claiming the sport's marquee race. He dined with his family after the Derby but didn't sleep much, a routine that figures to go on for the next few days amid a flood of interview requests. At some point he hopes to get his mind around all that has happened, but he already has a response ready.\n\n\"When somebody asks what my profession is, I'm able to tell them I'm a professional jockey. And then the first question they normally ask is, 'Have you ever won the Kentucky Derby?' I can say that now.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Springs,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_H._Cox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad H.

Mystik Dan will travel to Saratoga, New York, before they decide whether to enter him in the 1 3/16 mile Preakness.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek said Sunday morning outside his barn on Churchill Downs' back side. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. ... So, we'll just watch him over the next week. It'll be one of those (situations) where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nThe picturesque track in upstate New York will host the Belmont Stakes - the Triple Crown's final jewel - for the next three years while Belmont Park is being reconstructed. The Belmont has also been shortened to a 1 1/4 mile, matching the Derby distance that Mystik Dan won by a nose over Sierra Leone and Japan-bred Forever Young in the closest three-way finish since 1947.\n\nThe five-week gap between the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont follows a more normal race schedule for many thoroughbreds, and some trainers might opt to head to Saratoga to acclimate horses sooner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChad Brown said Sierra Leone will skip the Preakness and leave on Monday to train at Saratoga and run the Belmont. Considering how much it took for Sierra Leone to navigate other horses and chase down Mystik Dan before falling a nose short at the wire, rest sounds necessary.\n\n\"He's a real laid back horse, but when we brought him out, (he) was a little more tired than he normally is after his races,\" Brown said. \"I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nLouisville-born trainer Brad Cox is watching Catching Freedom (fourth) and Just A Touch (20th) before deciding their next steps. Forever Young and fellow Japan-bred T O Password (fifth) are headed home on Tuesday.\n\nThat could leave the Preakness without some Derby star power at first glance, though it won't lack for plotlines, with a number of well-rested horses expected to compete at Pimlico Race Course.\n\nHall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert could have two entrants as he seeks to follow up National Treasure's victory there last spring. He trains Santa Anita Derby runner-up Imagination and Arkansas Derby winner Muth, who missed the Derby after failed legal attempts by owner Amr Zedan to get him in despite Baffert's suspension by Churchill Downs through the end of 2024.\n\nJockey Brian Hernandez Jr. and Mystik Dan, right, head toward the finish alongside Forever Young, center, and Sierra Leone, left, in the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby on Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky. Brynn Anderson/Associated Press\n\nAs McPeek and the owners of Mystik Dan ponder a decision, he and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. basked in a wash of congratulations for a Derby victory that put them in exclusive company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaturday's win helped both claim rare weekend sweeps of the Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies. McPeek is just the third trainer to do that, and first since Ben Jones (who did it twice) in 1952, while Hernandez is the eighth rider to achieve the feat, and the first since fellow Louisiana native and Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Mystik Dan just stood calm and unfazed while a cluster of onlookers took photos and selfies as workers bathed him outside the barn. He was then draped with the winner's blanket signifying his Derby win before being led back to his stall with a WWE-style title belt laying on an outer wall. Oaks-winning filly Thorpedo Anna also made a brief appearance and soaked in the attention.\n\nHernandez is preparing for his own life-changing spotlight and title after claiming the sport's marquee race. He dined with his family after the Derby but didn't sleep much, a routine that figures to go on for the next few days amid a flood of interview requests. At some point, he hopes to get his mind around all that has happened, but he already has a response ready.\n\n\"When somebody asks what my profession is, I'm able to tell them I'm a professional jockey. And then the first question they normally ask is, 'Have you ever won the Kentucky Derby?' I can say that now.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

With the win, Mystik Dan has earned a winning share of $3.1 million from the Kentucky Derby purse.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Kentucky Derby payout, purse: How much money will winning horse make at Churchill Downs in 2024?\n\nMystik Dan's trainer, Kenny McPeek, became the first trainer since 1952 -- and the fourth ever -- to win both the Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby in the same year: Thorpedo Anna won the Kentucky Oaks on Friday.\n\nFor Mystik Dan himself, it is the second time -- the other being the 2024 Southwest Stakes (Grade 3) on Feb. 3 at Oaklawn Park -- this year that he has won a race. Entering the Kentucky Derby on Saturday, Mystik Dan had a career earnings of $550,050.\n\nHere's what you need to know from how much Mystik Dan won in cash prizes by winning the 2024 Kentucky Derby:\n\nBy winning the 2024 Kentucky Derby, Mystik Dan -- with Brian Hernandez Jr. as his jockey -- won the winner's share: $3.1 million.\n\nMystik Dan won $3.1 million of the record-breaking $5 million winner chest after winning the 2024 Kentucky Derby.\n\nWith the win at Churchill Downs, Mystik Dan will now have the chance to become the 14th horse -- and first since Justify in 2018 -- to be a Triple Crown winner. The Preakness Stakes will take place on Saturday, May 18 at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore while the Belmont Stakes will take place on Saturday, June 8 at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, New York. The Belmont Stakes is taking place at Saratoga Race Course this year as Belmont Park is currently undergoing renovations.\n\nUsing calculations from previous Kentucky Derby runnings by CNBC, Hernandez Jr. will take home 10% of the winning $3.1 million winning payout -- or $500,000.\n\nNote: The 10% percentage payout for the winning jockey of the Kentucky Derby is when the purse was $3 million. It remains unclear if that percentage will increase under the new purse number for 2024.\n\nThe Run for Roses purse for this year is a record-breaking $5 million, which is an increase of $2 million from what it was from 2019-2023.\n\n\"These record purse increases are a symbol of the health of horse racing in Kentucky,\" CEO of Churchill Downs Incorporated Bill Carstanjen said in a statement.\n\nHere's the full prize breakdown of the top five finishers at the Kentucky Derby:\n\nMystik Dan had a 20/1 odd per CBS Sports to win the Kentucky Derby, which tied for sixth best among all horses.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Oaks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Oaks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justify_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justify (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graded stakes race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimlico_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pimlico Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Springs,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Skating/Roller_Skating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Skating/Roller Skating", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539947", "eventUri": "eng-9539947", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-03", "textStart": 759, "textEnd": 765}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "textStart": 1474, "textEnd": 1480}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-08", "textStart": 1571, "textEnd": 1577}], "sentiment": 0.6000000000000001, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Mystik Dan gave Lexington-based trainer Kenny McPeek his first Kentucky Derby victory and gave McPeek the first Derby-Kentucky Oaks double for a trainer since 1952.\n\nWhat happened to everybody else in the field? Here's a look.\n\nWith Mystik Dan leading at the final turn, Blue Grass Stakes winner Sierra Leone, who was 17th at the first turn, and Forever Young, who was in the middle of the pack early, made a late charge from the outside. That charge came just short with a photo finish confirming Mystik Dan had just edged out Sierra Leone.\n\n\"You get beat a nose in the Kentucky Derby, it's a tough one,\" Sierra Leone's trainer, Chad Brown, said. \"But he's a tremendous horse, nearly undefeated. I'm just so lucky to have him, so proud of his effort today.\n\n\"He did what we asked him to do, just came up a little bit short. (I didn't think I won) watching it live, but then when they started showing the slo-mo, I thought maybe this could be a dead heat because I got a great bob. I just wasn't in front.\"\n\nForever Young finished third, just missing becoming the first Japan-bred horse to win the Derby.\n\nBrad Cox-trained Catching Freedom took a similar path to Mystik Dan, emerging from the pack along the rail in the final turn but was passed down the stretch by Sierra Leone and Forever Young.\n\n\"Overall I was very happy with Catching Freedom's effort,\" Cox said. \"I really was and the ride Flavien (Prat) gave him. We'll regroup, not sure where we'll land.\"\n\nT O Password, the other Japan-bred horse in the field, was never in contention for the win but made a late charge to finish fifth.\n\n\"He didn't break well,\" jockey Kazushi Kimura said. \"This was his third time running and he was in a new country. He probably wasn't 100% mature. Today he finished up strong. I hope the horse can stay for the Preakness.\"\n\nFlorida Derby winner Fierceness, the 3-1 race favorite, jumped out of the gate but recovered to be among a four-wide pack leading at the first turn. Fierceness was still in third with four furlongs to go.\n\nAfter Mystik Dan made his charge to the lead along the inside rail in the final turn, Fierceness faded, finishing 15th.\n\n\"He had the hop at the start, and we kind of had to hustle a little more than we wanted to,\" trainer Todd Pletcher said. \"Got some pressure on both sides coming by the eighth pole. ... Finally got to the position we wanted, but (jockey) Johnny (Velazquez) said he was a little bit too geared up at that point.\"\n\nJust Steel, Epic Ride and Track Phantom helped set the early pace alongside Fierceness but all finished out of contention. Track Phantom was 11th, Epic Ride was 14th and Just Steel, who is trained by D. Wayne Lukas, was 17th.\n\n\"I was on the lead for a while,\" Track Phantom's jockey, Joel Rosario, said. \"He ran his race but we couldn't hang in there. He did his best.\"\n\nJockey Keith Asmussen said Just Steel was squeezed leaving the gate, and Lukas said the early pace was too fast.\n\n\"It was probably a little too fast for the opening quarter-mile,\" Epic Ride's jockey, Adam Beschizza, said. \"I was a little too aggressive going past the wire. It was a rough, busy race. I was able to keep it uninterrupted for the most for him. It's just probably a bit too far.\"\n\nSanta Anita Derby-winner Stronghold was fourth heading into the final turn but finished seventh, just behind Wood Memorial winner Resilience. Honor Marie, who was last at the first turn, finished eighth.\n\n\"My race was over coming out of the gate,\" Honor Marie's jockey, Ben Curtis, said. \"I got speared from both sides, I lost an iron and had to put it back in. He was nearly down on his head but I gave him time to pick himself up. He didn't get the smoothest first quarter of a mile and I just let him float around a bit after that. Then I took to the inside because I didn't want to give away any more ground. He paid for the early exertion but he ran a credible race.\"\n\nEndlessly and Dornoch rounded out the top 10.\n\n\"He had a very bad trip,\" Dornoch's trainer, Danny Gargan, said. \"He was eliminated early. He got very tired. I'm disappointed in the way he ran today.\"\n\nWest Saratoga, whose trainer Larry Demeritte became the first Black trainer to saddle a horse in the Derby since 1989, finished 11th.\n\nDomestic Product (12th), Society Man (16th), Grand Mo the First (18th), Catalytic (19th) and Just a Touch (20th) were never really in the mix.\n\nMystik Dan wins historic 2024 Kentucky Derby in three-way photo finish at Churchill Downs\n\nKentucky Derby 2024 complete order of finish and payoffs at Churchill Downs\n\nSee the best photos, videos from 2024 Kentucky Derby: Mystik Dan's win, fashion, celebrities\n\nOwner of Kentucky Derby 2024 winner Mystik Dan dedicates victory to his late father\n\nBrian Hernandez Jr., long an underappreciated jockey, rides an unforgettable Kentucky Derby", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Brown_(horse_trainer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chad Brown (horse trainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Grass_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue Grass Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_(draw)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tie (draw)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Wayne_Lukas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D.

Literally. In one of the most dramatic finishes in the race's history, Mystic Dan crossed the line just a nose in front of his competition.\n\nIn what will, no doubt, be a Derby to be remembered and talked about for years, the 16-1 longshot, Mystic Dan, emerged the victor in a field of very qualified thoroughbreds. In what seemed like a very long time to determine, officials had to go to the photo finish to announce the winner.\n\nChurchill Downs held a record breaking crowd of over 156,000 spectators all holding their breath for the final determination of the winner.\n\nMystic Dan had to hold off Sierra Leone (5-1) and Forever Young (6-1) who were having a battle of their own coming down to the wire.\n\nTrained by Kenneth McPeek, Mystik Dan's victory was particularly special as McPeek became the first trainer since 1952 to win both the Kentucky Derby and the Kentucky Oaks in the same weekend, with Thorpedo Anna winning the Oaks on Friday. Jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. piloted Mystik Dan to victory, delivering a masterful ride that showcased his horse's abilities.\n\nFierceness (7-2) who was the clear favorite and had shown the ability to win finished in a disappointing position 15 when the race was over. The beautiful bay colt came out strong and led the field in the turn for home but faded.\n\nMystic Dan did exaclty the opposite. When the crowd came around the final turn, Hernandez found an opening along the rail and took it. From that point on, the horse surged and found new gears.\n\nSierra Leone and Forever Young mounted a fierce challenge on the outside, but Mystik Dan held on gamely to win by a nose in one of the closest finishes in Kentucky Derby history.\n\nThe result was not without controversy, as the stewards reviewed the finish before declaring Mystik Dan the official winner. The delay only added to the drama, with Hernandez describing the wait as \"the longest few minutes of my life.\" When the result was finally announced, Hernandez was overcome with emotion, saying, \"To see your number flash up to win the Derby, I don't think it will sink in for a while.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Mystik Dan will now aim to capture the second leg of the Triple Crown at the Preakness Stakes on May 18. If he can continue his winning ways, he will be well on his way to etching his name in the annals of horse racing history alongside legends like Secretariat, Seattle Slew, and American Pharoah.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_lambert@si.com", "name": "Laura Lambert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thoroughbred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Oaks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Oaks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bay (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Pharoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Pharoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Slew", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Slew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretariat_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretariat (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Barrel_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Barrel Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6295,h_3540,x_0,y_0/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx4varkqm4cy06yg93", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539947", "eventUri": "eng-9539947", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "textStart": 2389, "textEnd": 2395}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- The second jewel of horse racing's Triple Crown could be missing 150th Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and other co-stars, quashing hopes for a rematch after the thrilling three-wide photo finish in the milestone race.\n\nTrainer Kenny McPeek and the horse's ownership wouldn't commit to whether the colt would race in the 149th Preakness on May 18 in Baltimore, which requires a quick two-week turnaround. Mystik Dan will travel to Saratoga, New York, before they decide whether to enter him in the 1 3/16 mile Preakness.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek said Sunday morning outside his barn on Churchill Downs' back side. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. ... So, we'll just watch him over the next week. It'll be one of those (situations) where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nThe picturesque track in upstate New York will host the Triple Crown's final jewel for the next three years while Belmont Park is being reconstructed. The Belmont has also been shortened to a 1 1/4 mile, matching the Derby distance that Mystik Dan won by a nose over Sierra Leone and Japan-bred Forever Young in the closest three-way finish since 1947.\n\nThe five-week gap follows a more normal race schedule for many thoroughbreds and some trainers might opt to head to Saratoga to acclimate horses sooner.\n\nChad Brown said Sierra Leone will skip the Preakness and leave on Monday to train at Saratoga and run the Belmont. Considering how much it took for Sierra Leone to navigate other horses and chase down Mystik Dan before falling a nose short at the wire, rest sounds necessary.\n\n\"He's a real laid back horse but when we brought him out, was a little more tired than he normally is after his races,\" Brown said. \"I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nLouisville-born trainer Brad Cox is watching Catching Freedom (fourth) and Just A Touch (20th) before deciding their next steps. Forever Young and fellow Japan-bred T O Password (fifth) are headed home on Tuesday.\n\nThat could leave the Preakness without some Derby star power at first glance, though it won't lack for plotlines with a number of well-rested horses expected to compete at Pimlico Race Course.\n\nHall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert could have two entrants as he seeks to follow up National Treasure's victory there last spring. He trains Santa Anita Derby runner-up Imagination and Arkansas Derby winner Muth, who missed the Derby after failed legal attempts by owner Amr Zedan to get him in despite Baffert's suspension by Churchill Downs through the end of 2024.\n\nAs McPeek and the owners ponder a decision, he and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. basked in a wash of congratulations for a Derby victory that put them in exclusive company.\n\nSaturday's win helped both claim rare weekend sweeps of the Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies. McPeek is just the third trainer to do that and first since Ben Jones (who did it twice) in 1952, while Hernandez is the eighth rider to achieve the feat and first since fellow Louisiana native and Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Mystik Dan just stood calm and unfazed as a cluster of onlookers took photos and selfies as workers bathed him outside the barn. He was then draped with the winner's blanket signifying his Derby win before being led back to his stall with a WWE-style title belt laying on an outer wall. Oaks-winning filly Thorpedo Anna also made a brief appearance and soaked in the attention.\n\nHernandez is preparing for his own life-changing spotlight and title after claiming the sport's marquee race. He dined with his family after the Derby but didn't sleep much, a routine that figures to go on for the next few days amid a flood of interview requests. At some point he hopes to get his mind around all that has happened, but he already has a response ready.\n\n\"When somebody asks what my profession is, I'm able to tell them I'm a professional jockey. And then the first question they normally ask is, 'Have you ever won the Kentucky Derby?' I can say that now.\"\n\nAP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gary_b_graves@eagletribune.com", "name": "Gary B.

It was only the fourth time in the 150-year history of the races that a trainer has saddled the winners of both the Derby and Oaks in the same year.\n\n\"I'm really proud of that,\" McPeek said. \"But what are you gonna do? You only pick one horse at a time.\"\n\nThe finish was so tight that Hernandez thought, but didn't know, that Mystik Dan had won.\n\n\"The longest two minutes I've spent in my life, waiting for them to hang that number up,\" he said. \"It was exciting when we hit the wire, but I wasn't sure if we won, so it was quite a rush to sit there and wait for it.\n\n\"I always told myself I was never going to step into the Derby winner's circle until I could do it on the back of a horse. Now, to be able to live that dream ... I was a 6-year-old kid, riding my bike around my grandparents' farm, telling them all that I was going to win the Kentucky Derby some day -- and here we are.\"\n\nStarting from the No. 3 gate in a field of 20 enabled Mystik Dan to take a forward position in the race, avoiding the traffic issues that often prevent the best horses from reaching competition.\n\nWhen the field swung out of the stretch turn, Hernandez cut things so close, he said, that his left boot actually scraped the rail.\n\n\"When we cut the corner, I thought, 'Man, we have a chance to win the Kentucky Derby,'\" he said.\n\nHis chances were helped during the stretch battle as Sierra Leone lugged in, bumping repeatedly with Forever Young. Whether the contact cost either of them the noses by which they lost, racing will never know.\n\nSierra Leone came into the race with three wins from four starts, and finished second by a nose in the Grade II Remsen Stakes in December in the other. Trainer Chad Brown bemoaned his missed chance but praised the Gun Runner colt.\n\n\"He's a tremendous horse. We're so proud to have him. He just came up a little short,\" Brown said. \"The Derby gods can be cruel sometimes. Some trainers never win one.\"\n\nForever Young's performance was, if anything, even more impressive. He won his first two starts in Japan, and then traveled to Saudi Arabia, where he was fully extended through the stretch to win the Group III Saudi Derby.\n\nHe followed that with a victory a month later in the Group II Saudi Derby in Dubai, again using a relentless stretch run to catch the leader, South American-bred Auto Bahn.\n\nCatching Freedom's fourth-place finish followed the Louisiana Derby victory and a third, behind Sierra Leone, in the Grade II Risen Star, also at Fair Grounds in New Orleans.\n\nThe surprise of the day was T O Password. The Copano Rickey colt had only two previous starts, both in Japan. The second of those was by a head in the Fukuryu Stakes at Nakayama Racecourse, the final and deciding leg of the \"Japan Road to the Kentucky Derby.\"\n\nHe, too, might have fared even better at Churchill Downs but for a slow start and traffic issues.\n\nThe Triple Crown series now shifts focus to Pimlico Racecourse in Baltimore, where the Preakness Stakes awaits May 18.\n\nMystik Dan's part-owner, Lance Gasaway, clutching the gold Derby trophy, said, \"We'll discuss it.\"\n\nThe Preakness most likely will include some talented \"new shooters,\" including horses trained by Bob Baffert, who is banned from Churchill Downs and unable to contest the Derby for a third straight year.", "source": {"uri": "gephardtdaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gephardt Daily"},

We're going to roll the dice.'\"\n\nDelivering a \"Calvin Bo-Rail\" special, Hernandez made a bold move along the rail in the final turn that, ultimately, allowed Mystik Dan to get through to the lead and save just enough ground to prevail at the wire in a scintillating three-horse charge to the finish with Sierra Leone and Forever Young.\n\nWith a Churchill Downs crowed of 156,710 roaring, the three horses crossed the finish line almost locked in stride.\n\nUltimately, a photo finish showed Mystik Dan a nose ahead of Sierra Leone, who was a nose ahead of third-place Forever Young, the previously unbeaten Japanese horse. The winning time was 2:03.34.\n\nThe three-way photo to determine the victor was the first in a Kentucky Derby since 1947. It was a finish worthy of the 150th renewal of North America's marquee horse race -- and the ride by Hernandez proved every bit worthy of such a historic moment.\n\nOnce Mystik Dan claimed the lead entering the stretch, Hernandez said he had his head down, riding, and did not realize until the final jumps of the race that there were closers to his horse's outside charging hard to take the Kentucky Derby away.\n\nOnce the finish line had been crossed, Hernandez said he asked an outrider if Mystik Dan had won. The reply was probably, but it was not certain pending the photo.\n\nThe wait for Derby certainty \"was the longest two minutes of my life,\" Hernandez said.\n\nThe victory by trainer Kenny McPeek's Mystik Dan made Hernandez a Kentucky Derby champion in his fifth try at the race. In four previous Derbys, Hernandez had not finished better than eighth.\n\n\"It's unbelievable,\" Hernandez said. \"It still hasn't sunk in yet.\"\n\nEleven years ago, the 38-year-old Hernandez had another signature moment on one of horse racing's grandest stages. On the jockey's 27th birthday, he guided Fort Larned to victory in the 2012 Breeders' Cup Classic at Santa Anita.\n\nYet, for whatever reason, that victory did not elevate Hernandez's career to the elite level of racing.\n\nToiling mostly on the Kentucky racing circuit, Hernandez's great patron became McPeek. The trainer, a Tates Creek High School and University of Kentucky graduate, has long given Hernandez chances on his best horses. In 2021, Hernandez won four stakes races at Keeneland -- all on horses trained by McPeek.\n\n\"Well, the older you get, I don't get enamored with all the, I guess you could say, big-namers,\" McPeek said of more famous jockeys. \"With Brian and his agent (Frank Bernis), there's nothing complicated about either one of them. It's all business, business, business -- and there's no drama. And I like 'no drama.'\"\n\nOn Saturday, Hernandez repaid McPeek's faith.\n\nThe key point in the race came in the final turn. A tiring Track Phantom drifted out slightly. Hernandez asked Mystik Dan to push through a small hole along the rail.\n\n\"When I called upon him to hit that spot that I needed right before we straightened, to kind of get a little separation on the deep, deep closers, he did it,\" Hernandez said of Mystik Dan. \"He jumped off quickly and we were able to get that separation, and that made the difference of them not getting to him (at) the wire.\"\n\nAs the winning jockey in Kentucky Derby 150, Hernandez etched his name in race lore.\n\nHe joins Oliver Lewis (first Derby in 1875), J.D. Mooney (50th Derby in 1924) and Angel Cordero Jr. (100th Run for the Roses in 1974) as the winning jockeys in numerically significant Kentucky Derbys.\n\nIt was the weekend of a lifetime for the McPeek-Hernandez duo. The jockey and trainer also combined to win Friday's Kentucky Oaks with Thorpedo Anna.\n\nThat makes Hernandez the eighth jockey all-time to win the Kentucky Derby and the Kentucky Oaks in the same year. He is the first to do so since -- you guessed it -- Borel (Rachel Alexandra in the Oaks, Mine That Bird in the Derby) in 2009.\n\nAll it took for Hernandez to win the Kentucky Derby and put his name on several historic lists was a daring move along the rail that would have done Borel proud.\n\nSaid McPeek: \"Brian, his ride, was the difference today in winning.\"", "source": {"uri":

(AP) -- Mystik Dan won the 150th Kentucky Derby in a three-horse photo finish, edging out Sierra Leone by a nose with Forever Young third in the tightest finish since 1996 on Saturday.\n\nSent off at 18-1 odds, Mystik Dan and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. rode the rail down the stretch with a short lead. Sierra Leone, the second choice at 9-2 odds, and Forever Young from Japan gave chase and pressured the leader to the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs.\n\nAdvertisementAdvertisement\n\nIt was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- the closest margin in horse racing -- and the first since Grindstone wore the garland of red roses in 1996.\n\nSports Roundup\n\nGet the latest D-FW sports news, analysis, scores and more.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe crowd waited several minutes before the result was reviewed by the stewards and declared official.\n\n\"The longest few minutes of my life,\" Hernandez said, after he and the bay colt walked in circles while the stunning result was settled. \"To see your number flash up to win the Derby, I don't think it will sink in for a while.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFierceness, the 3-1 favorite, finished 15th in the field of 20 3-year-olds.\n\nMystik Dan ran 1 1/4 miles in 2:03.34 and paid $39.22, $16.32 and $10.\n\nHernandez and trainer Kenny McPeek had teamed for a wire-to-wire win in the Kentucky Oaks for fillies on Friday with Thorpedo Anna. McPeek is the first trainer to sweep both races since Ben Jones in 1952 and the fourth overall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcPeek's only other victory in a Triple Crown race was also a shocker: 70-1 Sarava won the 2002 Belmont Stakes -- the biggest upset in that race's history.

Mystik Dan will travel to Saratoga, New York, before they decide whether to enter him in the 1 3/16 mile Preakness.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek said Sunday morning outside his barn at Churchill Downs. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. ... So, we'll just watch him over the next week. It'll be one of those (situations) where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nTrainer Bob Baffert has told Pimlico officials that he is sending Muth and Imagination to Baltimore for the Preakness.\n\nRELATED: 'It's unbelievable': Kentucky Derby shares adorable photo of then 6-year-old Brian Hernandez Jr. who became winning jockey\n\nRELATED: Kentucky Derby 150 | Record-breaking number of bets placed\n\nMuth won the Arkansas Derby on March 30, when Mystik Dan finished third. Imagination was second behind Stronghold in the Santa Anita Derby on April 6.\n\nBaffert has won the Preakness eight times, including last year with National Treasure.\n\nSaratoga in upstate New York will host the Triple Crown's final race for the next three years while Belmont Park is being reconstructed. The Belmont has also been shortened to 1 1/4 miles, matching the Derby distance that Mystik Dan won by a nose over Sierra Leone and Japan-bred Forever Young in the closest three-way finish since 1947.\n\nThe five-week gap follows a more normal race schedule for many horses and some trainers might opt to head to Saratoga to acclimate horses sooner.\n\nChad Brown said Sierra Leone will skip the Preakness and leave on Monday to train at Saratoga and run in the Belmont.\n\n\"He's a real laidback horse but when we brought him out, was a little more tired than he normally is after his races,\" Brown said. \"I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nTrainer Brad Cox is watching Catching Freedom (fourth) and Just A Touch (20th) before deciding their next steps. Forever Young and fellow Japan-bred T O Password (fifth) are headed home on Tuesday.\n\nThat could leave the Preakness without some Derby star power at first glance, though it won't lack for plotlines with a number of well-rested horses expected to compete at Pimlico.\n\nAs McPeek and the owners ponder a decision, he and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. basked in a wash of congratulations for a Derby victory that put them in exclusive company.\n\nSaturday's win helped both claim rare weekend sweeps of the Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies. McPeek is just the third trainer to do that and first since Ben Jones (who did it twice) in 1952, while Hernandez is the eighth rider to achieve the feat and first since fellow Louisiana native and Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Mystik Dan just stood calm and unfazed as a cluster of onlookers took photos and selfies as workers bathed him outside the barn. He was then draped with the winner's blanket signifying his Derby win before being led back to his stall with a WWE-style title belt laying on an outer wall. Oaks-winning filly Thorpedo Anna also made a brief appearance and soaked in the attention.\n\nHernandez is preparing for his own life-changing spotlight and title after claiming the sport's marquee race. He dined with his family after the Derby but didn't sleep much, a routine that figures to go on for the next few days amid a flood of interview requests. At some point he hopes to get his mind around all that has happened, but he already has a response ready.\n\n\"When somebody asks what my profession is, I'm able to tell them I'm a professional jockey. And then the first question they normally ask is, 'Have you ever won the Kentucky Derby?' I can say that now.\"", "source": {"uri": "whas11.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "whas11.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Baffert", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bob Baffert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimlico_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pimlico Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Springs,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_H._Cox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad H.

Not yet,\" McPeek said after the phone call. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. We skipped the Rebel (Stakes) because it was back too quick, as well. ... It'll be one of those (decisions) where we take it up to the last minute.\"\n\nMystik Dan did leave some feed in his tub Saturday night after winning a three-horse photo finish with runner-up Sierra Leone and third-place finisher Forever Young.\n\nCoupled with Thorpedo Anna's win in Friday's Kentucky Oaks, McPeek became the first trainer to execute the Oaks/Derby double since the legendary Ben Jones accomplished the feat for Calumet Farm in 1952.\n\n\"An overnight sensation, 40 years later,\" McPeek joked Sunday.\n\nSaturday was a win for the good guys. The 61-year-old McPeek is a Tates Creek High School and University of Kentucky graduate who admits he spent a good portion of his time in the library at the UK agricultural school pouring over the bloodline histories in the BloodHorse and the old Thoroughbred Record.\n\nHis first Kentucky Derby horse, Tejano Run, finished second in 1995. He won the 2002 Belmont with Sarava and the 2022 Preakness with the filly Swiss Skydiver. He was 0-for-9 in the Derby, however, including 2002 when he saddled the favorite, Harlan's Holiday. After a seventh-place finish, the owners moved the colt to a different trainer.\n\nMystik Dan was a different colt, however. Outside of the post-time favorite Fierceness, Mystik Dan had run the only triple-digit Beyer Speed Figure -- 101 for his 8-length win in the Grade 3 Southwest Stakes -- in the Derby field. Even a third-place finish in the Arkansas Derby didn't dampen McPeek's enthusiasm about his Derby chances.\n\n\"I've thought for three weeks he was going to win the race,\" he said Sunday. \"I had a calm about it. I just did.\"\n\nHe again credited the terrific ride from jockey Brian Hernandez, a regular on McPeek's horses. Out of the No. 3 post position, Hernandez guided Mystik Dan to victory along the Churchill rail. In fact, Hernandez's boots even sported rail paint to prove it.\n\n\"We don't win the race without the job that Brian did,\" McPeek said.\n\nThe Preakness is also a different deal. These days, connections rarely run their horses in races two weeks apart. After Mystik Dan broke his maiden with a win at Churchill Downs on Nov. 12, McPeek ran the colt back in an optional claiming race at Churchill on Nov. 25, where Mystik Dan finished fifth.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us,\" McPeek said. \"If he's not in the feed tub, he won't run. And he ran hard yesterday. So we'll see.\"\n\nForever Young and Sierra Leone won't be in Baltimore. Forever Young must return to his home country of Japan before May 15 or be quarantined for three months. Trainer Chad Brown said Sunday that Sierra Leone will be pointed toward the Belmont Stakes at Saratoga, where the race will be run at a mile-and-a-quarter while Belmont Park is under renovation.\n\nMcPeek is headed to Saratoga, as well. He said he will leave for New York on Monday to set up his barn at the historic track.\n\nAfter finally winning the Kentucky Derby, how hard would it be to not run Mystik Dan back in the Preakness?\n\n\"I don't think it would be hard,\" McPeek said. \"I'll talk to (the owners) and the team here and like I said, we're going to let the horse tell us. If I don't think he's right and ready, we'll just wait for the Belmont.\"", "source": {"uri": "kentucky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexington Herald Leader"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_clay@kentucky.com", "name": "John Clay", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebel Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimlico_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pimlico Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Skydiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swiss Skydiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tejano_Run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tejano Run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_A._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben A.

When he finished third after a tough trip in the Arkansas Derby, he became a bit of an afterthought.\n\nBut his Beyer speed figure from the Southwest, which accounted for the track conditions and competition, told us he was potentially one of the fastest horses in this 3-year-old class and a tasty betting choice at 18-1 odds for the Derby.\n\nWhat a way to earn a defining victory, in the closest three-horse photo finish at a Derby since 1947.\n\n\"Ooh, that's tight. Look at that,\" McPeek said when the final margins hit the board at Churchill Downs.\n\nHe thought Mystik Dan had nosed ahead of Sierra Leone and Forever Young with a final bob of his head, but until he saw the result up there, he wasn't taking anything for granted.\n\nDerby favorite Fierceness seemed to get the setup he needed, breaking cleanly and stalking just off the lead as the race proceeded at a quick pace. When it was time to empty his tank, however, Fierceness flashed none of the speed that carried him to dominant victories in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and Florida Derby. He fell back to 15th by the end.\n\nInto that vacuum surged Mystik Dan, holding a strong, ground-saving position along the rail under jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. Then came the twin charge from mighty Sierra Leone and undefeated Japanese contender Forever Young.\n\nPerhaps no one expected Mystik Dan to hold off those more highly touted horses, but that he did, making good on the promise he'd shown three months earlier in the Arkansas slop.\n\nTraffic was always going to be Sierra Leone's greatest enemy.\n\nThe huge-striding colt had never run a bad race, but he's a late charger, and that's a tough style for the Derby, with 19 other horses clogging the path to victory.\n\nSure enough, when jockey Tyler Gaffalione went to make his move, he had to hold Sierra Leone up and swing him wide around a wall of horses. Once he got going, he locked into a rugged duel with Forever Young as they both bore down on Mystik Dan. After all that extra running and bumping, Sierra Leone, the 9-2 second choice, still came just a nose short.\n\n\"It's a tough one, but it's professional sports. Sometimes it's a game of inches,\" said the runner-up's trainer Chad Brown, who's still looking for the first Derby win of his wildly successful career.\n\n\"The Derby gods can be cruel at times, making you wait,\" he said.\n\nThere's no question, however, about the quality of Brown's horse. Whether confronted by traffic, mud or his own reluctance to go in the starting gate, Sierra Leone always finishes with a mighty kick. He's the one star in this class you can set your watch to, and it's hard to imagine he won't send Brown to the winner's circle in some big race later this year.\n\nOwner Lance Gasaway did not immediately commit Mystik Dan to the second leg of the Triple Crown, saying, \"We'll discuss it.\"\n\nWe can no longer count that trip as a given after 2022 Derby winner Rich Strike skipped the Preakness, sending another strong signal that the Triple Crown calendar -- three races in five weeks -- is out of step with modern training practices.\n\nAssuming the Gasaways and McPeek take the traditional path, however, they'll likely see a familiar foe.\n\nMuth beat Mystik Dan in the Arkansas Derby, and he would have been in the Kentucky Derby if Baffert was not still suspended from Churchill Downs because of Medina Spirit's 2021 medication violation. Owner Amr Zedan sued unsuccessfully to get his horse, and Baffert, into the first leg of the Triple Crown.\n\nInstead, Baffert will seemingly try to repeat his formula from last year, when he beat Derby champion Mage with a fresher horse, National Treasure, to win his eighth Preakness. Baffert also has Imagination, runner-up in the Santa Anita Derby, pointed toward the Preakness.\n\nWe'll have plenty of time to dissect the successes and controversies that have made Baffert the dominant figure in recent Triple Crown history. But from a pure competitive standpoint, the potential showdown between his horses and Mystik Dan gives the Preakness an intriguing hook.\n\nMuth could well be favored in a race that has favored fresher contenders in recent years. The story would be richer still if Sierra Leone, Forever Young or both show up in Baltimore.\n\nMcPeek won the pandemic-delayed 2020 Preakness with the great filly Swiss Skydiver, out-dueling Baffert's Derby winner, Authentic, but he ruled out Kentucky Oaks winning filly Thorpedo Anna as a possible Preakness entrant.", "source": {"uri": "capitalgazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Capital Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "childs_walker@capitalgazette.com", "name": "Childs Walker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Gaffalione", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Gaffalione"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Brown_(horse_trainer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chad Brown (horse trainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeders'_Cup_Juvenile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breeders' Cup Juvenile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Strike", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rich Strike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Treasure_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Treasure (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mage_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mage (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Skydiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swiss Skydiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Oaks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Oaks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Anita_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santa Anita Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bay (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Carriage_Driving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Carriage Driving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Barrel_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Barrel Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.capitalgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2151483182.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539947", "eventUri": "eng-9539947", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

For the veteran trainer from Lexington, last weekend permanently altered how his career will be viewed.\n\nWhen McPeek's Thorpedo Anna won the Kentucky Oaks on Friday, followed by the trainer's Mystik Dan claiming the Derby in a three-horse photo finish Saturday with Sierra Leone (second) and Forever Young (third), it pushed the Tates Creek High School graduate and University of Kentucky alum into newly rarefied air for a trainer.\n\nMcPeek became the first trainer to claim the Oaks/Derby double in the same year since Ben Jones, the iconic Calumet Farm conditioner, did it in 1952 with Real Delight (Oaks) and Hill Gail (Derby).\n\nWith Mystik Dan's Derby win following victories by the McPeek-trained Sarava in the 2002 Belmont Stakes and Swiss Skydiver in the 2020 Preakness, the trainer has now achieved the \"career Triple Crown.\"\n\n\"Goosebumps,\" McPeek said Saturday, when asked to reflect on the magnitude of his latest achievements.\n\n\u25aa Down: Chad Brown. The Kentucky Derby gods continue to torment Brown.\n\nWith the hard-closing Sierra Leone edged out of victory by Mystik Dan's nose, the trainer is now 0-for-8 in the Derby with two second-place finishes, a third, a fourth and a fifth.\n\n\"You get beat a nose in the Kentucky Derby, it's a tough one\" to take, Brown said Saturday.\n\n\u25aa Up: Brian Hernandez Jr. Long more accomplished at his craft than celebrated in his profession, the Kentucky-based jockey rewarded the faith of his longtime patron, Kenny McPeek, by riding Thorpedo Anna and Mystik Dan to their victories.\n\nThe gutty, ground-saving ride along the rail by the 38-year-old Hernandez on Mystik Dan was all but universally seen as the difference between winning and losing the Kentucky Derby. Afterward McPeek jokingly implored the media not to write about how impressive a ride it had been so other trainers won't hire Hernandez away.\n\n\"But I guess that cat is out of the bag, isn't it?\" McPeek said.\n\n\u25aa Down: John Velzaquez. When the veteran jockey booted the gritty Medina Spirit to victory in the 2021 Kentucky Derby, it moved Velazquez to an elite level in Derby history.\n\nThat victory made \"Johnny V.,\" only the fourth jockey with at least four Kentucky Derby wins, joining legends Eddie Arcaro and Bill Hartack (five each) and Bill Shoemaker (four).\n\nSubsequently, through no fault of Velazquez, the jockey lost his fourth Derby win when a postrace test showed a banned substance in the system of the Bob Baffert-trained Medina Spirit and the horse was disqualified.\n\nAt age 52, the clock is ticking on opportunities for Velazquez to \"get back\" the fourth Kentucky Derby win that he had taken away.\n\nThat had to make this year's Derby an acute disappointment for Velazquez. Riding race-time favorite Fierceness, Velazquez came home a disappointing 15th after sitting third at the mile pole in the 1 1/4-mile race.\n\n\"When I let (Fierceness) go, he just didn't have it,\" Velazquez said.\n\n\u25aa Up: Churchill Downs management. The 150th Kentucky Derby was apparently a smash hit on multiple fronts.\n\nNBC Sports announced Sunday that the 2024 Derby drew an average audience of 16.7 million viewers. According to NBC, it is the most-watched Kentucky Derby since the 1989 race averaged 18.5 million viewers.\n\nMeanwhile, Churchill Downs announced that $210.7 million was wagered on the Derby, the first time in history that figure went above $200 million.\n\nGiven those metrics, the controversial decision made by Churchill Downs Inc. to extend the original two-year suspension of trainer Bob Baffert related to the Medina Spirit disqualification to a third Kentucky Derby does not appear to have harmed the popularity of the event.\n\n\u25aa Down: Bob Baffert. Given the above figures, the two-time Triple Crown-winning trainer does not have much leverage in his interactions with Churchill Downs.\n\n\u25aa Up: Japan. Though the two Japanese horses who contested the 150th Kentucky Derby did not produce the breakthrough Triple Crown victory that race fans in Japan yearn for, they came close.\n\nThe previously unbeaten Forever Young fought gamely but was squeezed in the middle in the three-horse battle for the race win. Meanwhile, the less highly regarded Japanese horse in the Derby, T O Password, finished a respectable fifth.\n\nWith the recent success of Japanese horses in other major international races, it seems just a matter of time before the Triple Crown win barrier is breached.\n\n\u25aa Down: Martha Stewart. Given the honor of performing the \"Rider's Up\" call for the historically significant 150th Derby, the lifestyle guru and businesswoman nearly committed the verbal faux pas of referring to \"Kentucky\" as \"Connecticut.\"\n\n\"Racing fans from around the world, the city of Louisville and the Commonwealth of Conn -- Kentucky,\" Stewart said in her remarks.\n\nThe subsequent roasting Stewart took on the social media platform X was, I thought, out of proportion to her \"offense.\"\n\nNevertheless, given the magnitude of Derby 150, I think those who were asking why Churchill Downs did not have a celebrity of national import with direct ties to the state of Kentucky perform the \"Rider's Up\" call have a point.\n\nKentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan continuing on to the Preakness far from a sure thing\n\nBrian Hernandez Jr., long an underappreciated jockey, rides an unforgettable Kentucky Derby\n\nOwner of Kentucky Derby 2024 winner Mystik Dan dedicates victory to his late father\n\n'I believe in mojo.'

Lexington trainer earns rare double in thrilling Derby photo finish.", "body": "Click below to view more coverage from the Lexington Herald-Leader and Kentucky.com at the 150th Kentucky Derby on May 4 at Churchill Downs in Louisville.\n\nFor the 150th renewal, you could not have asked for a more thrilling Kentucky Derby.\n\nTrained by Lexingtonian Kenny McPeek, Mystik Dan edged hard-charging $2.3 million colt Sierra Leone and Japanese intruder Forever Young in a three-way photo finish by a nose (if that) to win a breathtaking Derby before 156,710 at Churchill Downs.\n\nNot only did McPeek earn his first Kentucky Derby victory, in combination with Thorpedo Anna's win in the Kentucky Oaks on Friday, McPeek became the first trainer since the legendary Ben Jones in 1952 to pull off the Oaks/Derby double. Jones did it with Oaks winner Real Delight and Derby winner Hill Gail.\n\n\"Wow,\" said McPeek on Saturday when asked about the feat.\n\n\"For three weeks, I felt like we were going to win both races, I can't tell you why,\" said the trainer. \"I believe in mojo. I believe in positive energy and we had a lot of that.\"\n\nBrian Hernandez Jr. became the first jockey to win both the Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby since Calvin Borel in 2009 on Rachel Alexandra in the Oaks and Mine That Bird in the Derby.\n\nA homebred owned by Arkansas' Lance Gasaway, 4 G Racing, Daniel Hamby III and Valley View Farm, Mystik Dan won in a time of 2:03 3/5. At odds of 18-1, he paid $39.22 to win, $16.32 to place and $10 to show. The son of Goldencents had won the Southwest Stakes by 8 lengths on a muddy track at Oaklawn on Feb. 3, but had finished third behind Muth and Just Steel in the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn on May 30.\n\n\"I'm pinching myself, wondering if this is real,\" said Gasaway. \"You just won the biggest horse race in America. Who would have dreamed it.\"\n\nThe 61-year-old McPeek won the 2002 Belmont Stakes with Sarava and the 2020 Preakness with the filly Swiss Skydiver, but was 0-for-9 in his home state's famous race. His best finish was second with Tejano Run all the way back in 1995.\n\nIt was a heartbreaking loss for the connections of Sierra Leone, who had won the Toyota Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland on April 6. With a deep closing running style, Sierra Leone made a strong move to the finish but came up a nose short.\n\n\"It's a tough one,\" said Chad Brown, trainer of Sierra Leone. \"It's professional sport, when you're at this level you're going to win some and lose some and often times it's a game of inches.\"\n\nThe previously unbeaten Forever Young was attempting to be the first Japanese-bred to win the Kentucky Derby. In the middle between Mystik Dan and Sierra Leone, Forever Young finished third.\n\nSierra Leone paid $6.54 to place and $4.64 to show. Forever Young paid $5.58 to show. The $1 exacta of 3-2 paid $129.28.\n\nMorning-line and post-time favorite Fierceness, the 13 1/2-length winner of the Florida Derby, challenged for the lead for most of the race, but faded badly in the stretch. Owned by Mike Repole and trained by Todd Pletcher, Fierceness finished 15th.\n\nThe finish was a terrific ending to a terrific day that included Churchill showing off its new $200 million paddock for a group of celebrities including Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl champion tight end and Taylor Swift boyfriend Travis Kelce, Martha Stewart (who nearly misspoke during the traditional \"Riders Up\" command by saying the \"Commonwealth of Connecticut\"), \"Tonight Show\" host Jimmy Fallon, new Kentucky basketball coach Mark Pope and now former UK basketball star Reed Sheppard, among others.\n\nFriday's Kentucky Oaks was contested over a sloppy track. The Churchill surface was listed as muddy for the opening races on Saturday, but had dried to a fast track with a temperature of 80 degrees by the 6:57 p.m. post time for the Kentucky Derby.\n\nThis was the third consecutive Kentucky Derby without trainer Bob Baffert, who has a record-tying six Derby victories to his credit, including a pair of Triple Crown winners (American Pharoah in 2015, Justify in 2018).\n\nThe California-based Baffert was initially suspended for two years after his trainee Medina Spirit hit the finish line first in the 2021 Kentucky Derby only to be disqualified after testing positive for Betamethasone, banned on race day. Last July, Churchill Downs, Inc. extended Baffert's suspension through 2024 for what it said was the trainer continuing \"to peddle a false narrative concerning the failed drug test of Medina Spirit.\"\n\nOwner Amr Zedan opted to stick with Baffert instead of transferring his star 3-year-old Muth to an eligible trainer. After winning the Arkansas Derby, Muth is being pointed to the May 18 Preakness Stakes in Baltimore. Zedan also owned Medina Spirit.\n\nBut this Kentucky Derby Day belonged to Mystik Dan and McPeek, the trainer who had earned his 2,000th victory as a trainer back in February. But for the Tates Creek High School and University of Kentucky graduate to finally win the Kentucky Derby was a dream come true.\n\n\"It means everything,\" McPeek said. \"It's been an amazing journey.\"", "source": {"uri": "kentucky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexington Herald Leader"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_clay@kentucky.com", "name": "John Clay", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington_Herald-Leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lexington Herald-Leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_A._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ben A.

What to know about the long-shot champion of Kentucky Derby 2024", "body": "Mystik Dan has won the 150th Kentucky Derby, a surprise to many given he was largely overlooked leading up to the race.\n\nAlong with offering an exhilarating by-a-nose photo finish, the horse also has a local tie in that he's Kentucky bred and his trainer is a University of Kentucky graduate.\n\nHere's what you need to know about one dandy horse that claimed the blanket of red roses:\n\nMystik Dan went off at 18-1 odds at post time, edging forward to win by a nose in an electrifying photo finish.\n\nThe bay colt was bred in Kentucky and earned little attention going into Saturday's race. Most of the buzz centered on favorite Fierceness (3-1) and such top contenders as Sierra Leone (9/2), Forever Young (6-1), Catching Freedom (8-1) and others.\n\nStill, Mystik Dan was not to be dismissed, previously excelling on a sloppy track when he won the Southwest Stakes in February. He earned his first career win at Churchill Downs last November.\n\nMystik Dan was sired by Goldenscents, the dual Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile winner. His dam is Ma'am by Colonel John.\n\nPrior to his Kentucky Derby win Saturday, 38-year-old Brian Hernandez was winless on four Derby starts.

Mystik Dan will travel to Saratoga, N.Y., before they decide whether to enter him in the Preakness.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek said Sunday morning outside his barn on Churchill Downs' back side. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. ... So, we'll just watch him over the next week. It'll be one of those [situations] where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nThe picturesque track in upstate New York will host the Triple Crown's final jewel for the next three years while Belmont Park is being reconstructed. The Belmont has also been shortened to a 1\u00bc mile (about two kilometres), matching the Derby distance that Mystik Dan won by a nose over Sierra Leone and Japan-bred Forever Young in the closest three-way finish since 1947.\n\nThe five-week gap follows a more normal race schedule for many thoroughbreds and some trainers might opt to head to Saratoga to acclimate horses sooner.\n\nChad Brown said Sierra Leone will skip the Preakness and leave on Monday to train at Saratoga and run the Belmont. Considering how much it took for Sierra Leone to navigate other horses and chase down Mystik Dan before falling a nose short at the wire, rest sounds necessary.\n\nLouisville-born trainer Brad Cox is watching Catching Freedom (fourth) and Just A Touch (20th) before deciding their next steps. Forever Young and fellow Japan-bred T O Password (fifth) are headed home on Tuesday.\n\nThat could leave the Preakness without some Derby star power at first glance, though it won't lack for plotlines with a number of well-rested horses expected to compete at Pimlico Race Course.\n\nHall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert could have two entrants as he seeks to follow up National Treasure's victory there last spring. He trains Santa Anita Derby runner-up Imagination and Arkansas Derby winner Muth, who missed the Derby after failed legal attempts by owner Amr Zedan to get him in despite Baffert's suspension by Churchill Downs through the end of 2024.\n\nAs McPeek and the owners ponder a decision, he and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. basked in a wash of congratulations for a Derby victory that put them in exclusive company.\n\nSaturday's win helped both claim rare weekend sweeps of the Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies. McPeek is just the third trainer to do that and first since Ben Jones (who did it twice) in 1952, while Hernandez is the eighth rider to achieve the feat and first since fellow Louisiana native and Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Mystik Dan just stood calm and unfazed as a cluster of onlookers took photos and selfies as workers bathed him outside the barn. He was then draped with the winner's blanket signifying his Derby win before being led back to his stall with a WWE-style title belt laying on an outer wall.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_H._Cox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad H.

The son of Goldencents had won the Southwest Stakes by 8 lengths on a muddy track at Oaklawn on Feb. 3, but had finished third behind Muth and Just Steel in the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn on May 30.\n\n\"I'm pinching myself, wondering if this is real,\" Gasaway said. \"You just won the biggest horse race in America. Who would have dreamed it.\"\n\nThe 61-year-old McPeek won the 2002 Belmont Stakes with Sarava and the 2020 Preakness with the filly Swiss Skydiver, but was 0 for 9 in his home state's famous race. His best finish was second with Tejano Run all the way back in 1995.\n\nIt was a heartbreaking loss for the connections of Sierra Leone, who had won the Toyota Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland on April 6. With a deep closing running style, Sierra Leone made a strong move to the finish but came up a nose short.\n\n\"It's a tough one,\" said Chad Brown, trainer of Sierra Leone. \"It's professional sport, when you're at this level you're going to win some and lose some and often times it's a game of inches.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThe previously unbeaten Forever Young was attempting to be the first Japanese-bred to win the Kentucky Derby. In the middle between Mystik Dan and Sierra Leone, Forever Young finished third.\n\nSierra Leone paid $6.54 to place and $4.64 to show. Forever Young paid $5.58 to show. The $1 exacta of 3-2 paid $129.28.\n\nMorning-line and post-time favorite Fierceness, the 13 1/2-length winner of the Florida Derby, challenged for the lead for most of the race, but faded badly in the stretch. Owned by Mike Repole and trained by Todd Pletcher, Fierceness finished 15th.\n\nThe finish was a terrific ending to a terrific day that included Churchill showing off its new $200 million paddock for a group of celebrities including Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl champion tight end and Taylor Swift boyfriend Travis Kelce, Martha Stewart (who nearly misspoke during the traditional \"Riders Up\" command by saying the \"Commonwealth of Connecticut\"), \"Tonight Show\" host Jimmy Fallon, new Kentucky basketball coach Mark Pope and now former UK basketball star Reed Sheppard, among others.\n\nFriday's Kentucky Oaks was contested over a sloppy track. The Churchill surface was listed as muddy for the opening races on Saturday, but had dried to a fast track with a temperature of 80 degrees by the 6:57 p.m. post time for the Kentucky Derby.\n\nThis was the third consecutive Kentucky Derby without trainer Bob Baffert, who has a record-tying six Derby victories to his credit, including a pair of Triple Crown winners (American Pharoah in 2015, Justify in 2018).\n\nThe California-based Baffert was initially suspended for two years after his trainee Medina Spirit hit the finish line first in the 2021 Kentucky Derby only to be disqualified after testing positive for Betamethasone, banned on race day. Last July, Churchill Downs, Inc. extended Baffert's suspension through 2024 for what it said was the trainer continuing \"to peddle a false narrative concerning the failed drug test of Medina Spirit.\"\n\nOwner Amr Zedan opted to stick with Baffert instead of transferring his star 3-year-old Muth to an eligible trainer. After winning the Arkansas Derby, Muth is being pointed to the May 18 Preakness Stakes in Baltimore. Zedan also owned Medina Spirit.\n\nBut this Kentucky Derby Day belonged to Mystik Dan and McPeek, the trainer who had earned his 2,000th victory as a trainer back in February. But for the Tates Creek High School and University of Kentucky graduate to finally win the Kentucky Derby was a dream come true.\n\n\"It means everything,\" McPeek said. \"It's been an amazing journey.\"\n\n\u00a92024 Lexington Herald-Leader.

Here are some fascinating points you may not have known about champion Mystik Dan.\n\nMystik Dan's Kentucky Derby title was extremely close. He won a three-way photo finish over second place finisher Sierra Leone and a third place finisher Forever Young. Mystik Dan's victory actually came by a nose. Forever Young is a Japanese thoroughbred race horse.\n\nThis was the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby. Aristides won the first Kentucky Derby in 1875. Black Gold won the 50th Kentucky Derby in 1924, and Cannonade won the 100th Kentucky Derby in 1974.\n\nThe native of Lafayette, Louisiana won his first Triple Crown race. The most notable win he had prior to Saturday came in 2012 when Hernandez Jr. won the 2012 Breeders' Cup Classic on the horse Fort Larned.\n\nThe 2024 Kentucky Derby was the third Triple Crown win for trainer Kenneth McPeek of Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. It was also the first Kentucky Derby win for McPeek. He previously trained Sarava to a Belmont Stakes victory in 2002, and filly Swiss Skydiver to a win at the Preakness in 2020.\n\nMcPeek was the first trainer since 1952 to win the Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby in the same year. On May 3, a day before the Kentucky Derby, McPeek trained Thorpedo Anna to victory. Interestingly, Hernandez Jr. was also the winning jockey. In 1952, Ben Jones of Parnell, Missouri trained Real Delight to a win at the Kentucky Oaks and Hill Gail to a win at the Kentucky Derby.\n\nMystik Dan's only other win came at the Southwest Stakes in Hot Springs, Arkansas this past January.

GRAVES Associated Press\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The second jewel of horse racing's Triple Crown could be missing 150th Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and other co-stars, quashing hopes for a rematch after the thrilling three-wide photo finish in the milestone race.\n\nTrainer Kenny McPeek and the horse's ownership wouldn't commit to whether the colt would race in the Preakness on May 18 in Baltimore, which requires a quick two-week turnaround. Mystik Dan will travel to Saratoga, New York, before they decide whether to enter him in the 1 3/16 mile Preakness.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek said Sunday morning outside his barn at Churchill Downs. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. ... So, we'll just watch him over the next week. It'll be one of those (situations) where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nWentzville superintendent's departure came after threats and police patrols Washington University faculty placed on leave, students 'houseless' after Gaza protest Cardinals games dropped by Comcast after Bally Sports deal falls through Busch Stadium needs renovations.

'It's my university's turn.' Media Views: Battlehawks dominate spring football in attendance, but no longer in TV ratings St. Louis Aldermanic President Megan Green says WashU lying about reason for her suspension\n\nTrainer Bob Baffert has told Pimlico officials that he is sending Muth and Imagination to Baltimore for the Preakness.\n\nMuth won the Arkansas Derby on March 30, when Mystik Dan finished third. Imagination was second behind Stronghold in the Santa Anita Derby on April 6.\n\nBaffert has won the Preakness eight times, including last year with National Treasure.\n\nSaratoga in upstate New York will host the Triple Crown's final race for the next three years while Belmont Park is being reconstructed. The Belmont has also been shortened to 1 1/4 miles, matching the Derby distance that Mystik Dan won by a nose over Sierra Leone and Japan-bred Forever Young in the closest three-way finish since 1947.\n\nThe five-week gap follows a more normal race schedule for many thoroughbreds and some trainers might opt to head to Saratoga to acclimate horses sooner.\n\nChad Brown said Sierra Leone will skip the Preakness and leave on Monday to train at Saratoga and run the Belmont. Considering how much it took for Sierra Leone to navigate other horses and chase down Mystik Dan before falling a nose short at the wire, rest sounds necessary.\n\n\"He's a real laid back horse but when we brought him out, was a little more tired than he normally is after his races,\" Brown said. \"I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nLouisville-born trainer Brad Cox is watching Catching Freedom (fourth) and Just A Touch (20th) before deciding their next steps. Forever Young and fellow Japan-bred T O Password (fifth) are headed home on Tuesday.\n\nThat could leave the Preakness without some Derby star power at first glance, though it won't lack for plotlines with a number of well-rested horses expected to compete at Pimlico Race Course.\n\nHall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert could have two entrants as he seeks to follow up National Treasure's victory there last spring. He trains Santa Anita Derby runner-up Imagination and Arkansas Derby winner Muth, who missed the Derby after failed legal attempts by owner Amr Zedan to get him in despite Baffert's suspension by Churchill Downs through the end of 2024.\n\nAs McPeek and the owners ponder a decision, he and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. basked in a wash of congratulations for a Derby victory that put them in exclusive company.\n\nSaturday's win helped both claim rare weekend sweeps of the Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies. McPeek is just the third trainer to do that and first since Ben Jones (who did it twice) in 1952, while Hernandez is the eighth rider to achieve the feat and first since fellow Louisiana native and Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Mystik Dan just stood calm and unfazed as a cluster of onlookers took photos and selfies as workers bathed him outside the barn. He was then draped with the winner's blanket signifying his Derby win before being led back to his stall with a WWE-style title belt laying on an outer wall. Oaks-winning filly Thorpedo Anna also made a brief appearance and soaked in the attention.\n\nHernandez is preparing for his own life-changing spotlight and title after claiming the sport's marquee race. He dined with his family after the Derby but didn't sleep much, a routine that figures to go on for the next few days amid a flood of interview requests. At some point he hopes to get his mind around all that has happened, but he already has a response ready.\n\n\"When somebody asks what my profession is, I'm able to tell them I'm a professional jockey. And then the first question they normally ask is, 'Have you ever won the Kentucky Derby?' I can say that now.\"\n\nTV RATINGS: Mystik Dan's nose victory in the 150th Kentucky Derby drew 16.7 million viewers, the biggest audience for the race since 1989.\n\nViewership peaked at 20.1 million from 7 to 7:15 p.m. EDT on Saturday, when 18-1 shot Mystik Dan, Sierra Leone and Forever Young hit the wire together in the Derby's first three-horse photo finish since 1947. That marked the biggest peak audience ever for the Derby on NBC.\n\nThe 16.7 million viewers was up 13% from last year's 14.8 million.\n\nNBC Sports said Sunday it was the biggest Derby audience since 18.5 million watched Sunday Silence win in 1989, when the race was shown on ABC.\n\nClose\n\nA race fan sits in the stands Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby

The last jockey to do the Oaks-Derby double was Calvin Borel in 2009 with Rachel Alexandra and Mine That Bird. The last trainer to do the double was Ben Jones in 1952 with Real Delight and Hill Gail.\n\nMcPeek is only the fourth-ever trainer to do the Oaks-Derby double in the same year.\n\nAfter Friday's Kentucky Oaks was contested over a sloppy track and rain threatened throughout Saturday, the Derby was run over a fast main track at Churchill.\n\nIt didn't matter. McPeek and Hernandez won in both conditions at Churchill Downs this weekend.\n\nCatching Freedom finished in fourth. T O Password (JPN) finished in fifth. Both of the Japenese horses in this year's race placed in the top five.\n\nA $2 exacta in the Derby with Mystik Dan and Sierra Leone paid $258.56. A $1 trifecta with Mystik Dan, Sierra Leone and Forever Young (JPN) paid $1,113.84.\n\nMcPeek was previously 0-for-9 in the Derby, with his best finish being second with Tejano Run in 1995.\n\nHernandez had been 0-for-4 in the Derby, with his best finish being eighth with McCraken in 2017.\n\n\"Brian just did an amazing job,\" McPeek said post-race on NBC, praising the jockey, Hernandez, multiple times.\n\nMystik Dan (who broke from post position 3) is owned by Lance Gasaway, 4 G Racing (Brent Gasaway and Daniel Hamby. This was the first Kentucky Derby for all of Mystik Dan's owners.\n\nThe horse went off at 18-1 odds in the Derby.\n\nMystik Dan had accrued 46 Derby qualifying points, which included a third-place finish in the Grade 1 Arkansas Derby on March 30 at Oaklawn Park and a win in the Grade 3 Southwest Stakes in early February at Oaklawn Park.\n\nMystik Dan had 20-1 morning-line odds following last week's post position draw, before he was bet down to the 18-1 odds he went off at.\n\nThe horse is now 3-1-1 in seven career starts. He entered the Derby with career earnings of $641,360, a total that will significantly increase after Saturday's result.\n\nThe bay-colored horse was bred in Kentucky and was sired by Goldencents. Mystik Dan's dam was Ma'am, by Colonel John.\n\nA homebred, Mystik Dan earned his first career win at Churchill Downs last November.\n\nFierceness, the morning-line favorite and the 3-1 post-time favortie, finished in 15th.\n\nThe 2024 Derby Day attendance was 156,710 spectators at Churchill Downs, an increase of more than 6,000 fans from the crowd of 150,335 people that gathered for last year's race.\n\nAs always, several high-quality stakes races took place on the Derby undercard Saturday at Churchill Downs.\n\nThe early undercard races were dominated by jockey Irad Ortiz Jr., who won each of the Grade 2, $600,000 Twin Spires Turf Sprint Stakes, Grade 1, $1 million Derby City Distaff Stakes and Grade 2, $665,000 Longines Churchill Distaff Turf Mile Stakes.\n\nOrtiz won each of those races for a different trainer: Ortiz was aboard Cogburn for Steve Asmussen in a 2 1/4-length victory in the Turf Sprint, Vahva for Cherie DeVaux in a 2-length victory in the Derby City Distaff and Chili Flag (FR) for Chad Brown in a win that came by a neck in the Churchill Distaff Turf Mile.\n\nThe 88-year-old trainer D. Wayne Lukas teamed up with jockey Jaime Torres to win the Grade 2, $600,000 Pat Day Mile Stakes by 1 1/4 lengths with Seize the Grey, and trainer H. Graham Motion paired with jockey Umberto Rispoli to win the Grade 2, $600,000 American Turf Stakes with 47-1 long shot Trikari.\n\nAsmussen also won the Grade 1, $1 million Churchill Downs by 2 1/2 lengths with Gun Pilot, who was ridden by Cristian Torres.\n\nNew UK men's basketball coach Mark Pope attends 2024 Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs\n\nFormer UK basketball star Reed Sheppard attends his first Kentucky Derby, makes his pick\n\nHere's who Mark Pope and the new UK basketball coaches are picking in the Kentucky Derby\n\nTravis Kelce -- but no Taylor Swift -- spotted at Churchill Downs for Kentucky Derby 2024\n\nFor Kentucky Derby first-timers, spectacle and fashion make bucket list trips complete", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graded stakes race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Oaks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Oaks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaklawn_Racing_Casino_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oaklawn Racing Casino Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_A._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben A.

He did, too, after a delay of several minutes while the closest three-horse photo finish since 1947 was sorted out.\n\nThat year, Jet Pilot won by a head over Phalanx and a length ahead of Faultless.\n\nMystik Dan, an 18-1 shot, edged Sierra Leone by a nose, with Forever Young another nose back in third on Saturday. Sierra Leone was the most expensive horse in the race at $2.3 million.\n\nLong shots Track Phantom and Just Steel led the field through the early going, with 3-1 favorite Fierceness racing three-wide just off the leaders.\n\nAt the top of the stretch, everything changed.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He quickly opened up a daylight advantage on the field.\n\n\"When he shot through that spot, he was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it,\" Hernandez said. \"He shot off and I'm like, 'Oh man, I've got a big chance to win the Kentucky Derby.'\"\n\nTo Mystik Dan's outside, Sierra Leone and Forever Young took up the chase in the middle of the track.\n\nAs Mystik Dan sped along the rail, Sierra Leone lugged in and bumped Forever Young three times in the stretch, but jockey Ryusei Sakai didn't claim foul.\n\nMystik Dan got so close to the rail that Hernandez's boot struck it.\n\n\"But I think we can buy another pair of boots,\" he said.\n\nThe winner's share of the record $5 million purse was $3.1 million, with the jockey and trainer typically earning 10% each.\n\n\"Just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey and ride,\" McPeek said. \"Brian is one of the most underrated jockeys, but not anymore, right?\"\n\nSierra Leone, the second choice at 9-2 odds, and Forever Young from Japan came up just short at the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs, the largest crowd since 2018.\n\nIt was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- the closest margin in horse racing -- and the first since Grindstone edged Cavonnier to wear the garland of red roses in 1996.\n\nThe crowd waited several minutes in the heat and humidity as the result was reviewed by the stewards and declared official.\n\n\"The longest few minutes of my life,\" Hernandez said, after he and Mystik Dan walked in circles while the stunning result was settled. \"To see your number flash up to win the Derby, I don't think it will sink in for a while.\"\n\nFierceness finished 15th in the field of 20 3-year-olds. Owner Mike Repole is 0 for 8 in the derby. He had the favorite in 2011 with Uncle Mo, who was scratched the day before the race with an illness. Last year, Forte was scratched the morning of the race as the favorite with a bruised foot.\n\nMystik Dan ran 1\u00bc miles over a fast track in 2:03.34 and paid $39.22, $16.32 and $10.\n\nTags Sports

Mystik Dan will travel to Saratoga, New York, before they decide whether to enter him in the 1 3/16 mile Preakness.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek said Sunday morning outside his barn at Churchill Downs. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me....

It'll be one of those [situations] where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nTrainer Bob Baffert has told Pimlico officials that he is sending Muth and Imagination to Baltimore for the Preakness.\n\nMuth won the Arkansas Derby on March 30, when Mystik Dan finished third. Imagination was second behind Stronghold in the Santa Anita Derby on April 6.\n\nBaffert has won the Preakness eight times, including last year with National Treasure.\n\nSaratoga in upstate New York will host the Triple Crown's final race for the next three years while Belmont Park is being reconstructed. The Belmont has also been shortened to 1 1/4 miles, matching the Derby distance that Mystik Dan won by a nose over Sierra Leone and Japan-bred Forever Young in the closest three-way finish since 1947.\n\nThe five-week gap follows a more normal race schedule for many horses and some trainers might opt to head to Saratoga to acclimate horses sooner.\n\nChad Brown said Sierra Leone will skip the Preakness and leave on Monday to train at Saratoga and run in the Belmont.\n\n\"He's a real laidback horse but when we brought him out, was a little more tired than he normally is after his races,\" Brown said. \"I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nTrainer Brad Cox is watching Catching Freedom (fourth) and Just A Touch (20th) before deciding their next steps. Forever Young and fellow Japan-bred T O Password (fifth) are headed home on Tuesday.\n\nThat could leave the Preakness without some Derby star power at first glance, though it won't lack for plotlines with a number of well-rested horses expected to compete at Pimlico.\n\nAs McPeek and the owners ponder a decision, he and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. basked in a wash of congratulations for a Derby victory that put them in exclusive company.\n\nSaturday's win helped both claim rare weekend sweeps of the Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies. McPeek is just the third trainer to do that and first since Ben Jones (who did it twice) in 1952, while Hernandez is the eighth rider to achieve the feat and first since fellow Louisiana native and Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Mystik Dan just stood calm and unfazed as a cluster of onlookers took photos and selfies as workers bathed him outside the barn. He was then draped with the winner's blanket signifying his Derby win before being led back to his stall with a WWE-style title belt laying on an outer wall. Oaks-winning filly Thorpedo Anna also made a brief appearance and soaked in the attention. AP\n\nHernandez is preparing for his own life-changing spotlight and title after claiming the sport's marquee race. He dined with his family after the Derby but didn't sleep much, a routine that figures to go on for the next few days amid a flood of interview requests. At some point he hopes to get his mind around all that has happened, but he already has a response ready.\n\n\"When somebody asks what my profession is, I'm able to tell them I'm a professional jockey. And then the first question they normally ask is, 'Have you ever won the Kentucky Derby?' I can say that now.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessmirror.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessMirror"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Baffert", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bob Baffert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimlico_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pimlico Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Treasure_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Treasure (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_H._Cox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad H.

(AP) -- The second jewel of horse racing's Triple Crown could be missing 150th Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and other co-stars, quashing hopes for a rematch after the thrilling three-wide photo finish in the milestone race.\n\nTrainer Kenny McPeek and the horse's ownership wouldn't commit to whether the colt would race in the 149th Preakness on May 18 in Baltimore, which requires a quick two-week turnaround. Mystik Dan will travel to Saratoga, New York, before they decide whether to enter him in the 1 3/16 mile Preakness.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek said Sunday morning outside his barn on Churchill Downs' back side. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. ... So, we'll just watch him over the next week. It'll be one of those (situations) where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nThe picturesque track in upstate New York will host the Triple Crown's final jewel for the next three years while Belmont Park is being reconstructed. The Belmont has also been shortened to a 1 1/4 mile, matching the Derby distance that Mystik Dan won by a nose over Sierra Leone and Japan-bred Forever Young in the closest three-way finish since 1947.\n\nThe five-week gap follows a more normal race schedule for many thoroughbreds and some trainers might opt to head to Saratoga to acclimate horses sooner.\n\nChad Brown said Sierra Leone will skip the Preakness and leave on Monday to train at Saratoga and run the Belmont. Considering how much it took for Sierra Leone to navigate other horses and chase down Mystik Dan before falling a nose short at the wire, rest sounds necessary.\n\n\"He's a real laid back horse but when we brought him out, was a little more tired than he normally is after his races,\" Brown said. \"I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nLouisville-born trainer Brad Cox is watching Catching Freedom (fourth) and Just A Touch (20th) before deciding their next steps. Forever Young and fellow Japan-bred T O Password (fifth) are headed home on Tuesday.\n\nThat could leave the Preakness without some Derby star power at first glance, though it won't lack for plotlines with a number of well-rested horses expected to compete at Pimlico Race Course.\n\nHall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert could have two entrants as he seeks to follow up National Treasure's victory there last spring. He trains Santa Anita Derby runner-up Imagination and Arkansas Derby winner Muth, who missed the Derby after failed legal attempts by owner Amr Zedan to get him in despite Baffert's suspension by Churchill Downs through the end of 2024.\n\nAs McPeek and the owners ponder a decision, he and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. basked in a wash of congratulations for a Derby victory that put them in exclusive company.\n\nSaturday's win helped both claim rare weekend sweeps of the Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies. McPeek is just the third trainer to do that and first since Ben Jones (who did it twice) in 1952, while Hernandez is the eighth rider to achieve the feat and first since fellow Louisiana native and Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Mystik Dan just stood calm and unfazed as a cluster of onlookers took photos and selfies as workers bathed him outside the barn. He was then draped with the winner's blanket signifying his Derby win before being led back to his stall with a WWE-style title belt laying on an outer wall. Oaks-winning filly Thorpedo Anna also made a brief appearance and soaked in the attention.\n\nHernandez is preparing for his own life-changing spotlight and title after claiming the sport's marquee race. He dined with his family after the Derby but didn't sleep much, a routine that figures to go on for the next few days amid a flood of interview requests. At some point he hopes to get his mind around all that has happened, but he already has a response ready.\n\n\"When somebody asks what my profession is, I'm able to tell them I'm a professional jockey. And then the first question they normally ask is, 'Have you ever won the Kentucky Derby?' I can say that now.\"\n\n___\n\nAP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing", "source": {"uri": "valleycentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KVEO-TV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@valleycentral.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Springs,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_H._Cox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad H.

The 20-1 longshot, ridden by jockey Brian Hernandez Jr., narrowly defeated favorites Sierra Leone and Forever Young by just a nose at Churchill Downs, according to NBC News.\n\nBefore winning the Kentucky Derby, Mystik Dan had only managed a third-place finish at the Arkansas Derby and a victory at the Grade III Southwest Stakes, NBC News reported. Trained by Kenny McPeek, this Derby win represents McPeek's first, adding to his resume, which includes training Swiss Skydiver, the 2020 Preakness Stakes champion, and Sarava, the 2002 Belmont Stakes winner.\n\nThe victory was especially gratifying for Hernandez. This Derby win is his first, capping a remarkable 24 hours for the McPeek-Hernandez team, which also celebrated a win at the Kentucky Oaks last Friday with Thorpedo Anna.\n\n\"I wasn't sure if we had won,\" jockey Hernandez told NBC Sports. \"So it was quite a rush to sit here and wait for it.\"\n\nThe race itself was tense, with favorites Sierra Leone and Forever Young jostling for the lead, a skirmish that may have cost them the race as Mystik Dan surged ahead to claim victory. Despite the disappointment, Sierra Leone's trainer, Chad Brown, expressed pride in his horse's performance, acknowledging the tight finish and praising the horse for living up to expectations.(RELATED: Dozens Of Horses Fall Seriously Ill, Several Die.

The horse did everything we asked him to do,\" Brown said, NBC News stated. \"It just came up just a little bit short.\"\n\nThe excitement of the Derby was reflected in the star-studded attendance, with celebrities like Wynonna Judd, Martha Stewart, and sports figures such as Aaron Rodgers and Travis Kelce enjoying the festivities under the iconic twin spires of Louisville, according to NBC News

In one of the closest finishes in almost 30 years, Mystik Dan won the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby.\n\nThe horse was generally overlooked by most, but he ran a smart race on the rail and poked his head in front in the final strides and held off Sierra Leone and Forever Young in the blanket finish.\n\nIt also completed a rare double for trainer Kenny McPeek and jockey Brian Hernandez, who also won the Kentucky Oaks on Friday with Thorpedo Anna. It was only the fourth time that has been done.\n\n\"That was the longest few minutes in my life I've spent waiting for them to hang the dang number up,\" Hernandez said.\n\nMcPeek was effusive of his praise for Hernandez.\n\n\"Brian did an amazing job,\" McPeek said. \"He's just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey. He's probably one of the most underrated riders in the business. But not anymore.\"\n\nMystik Dan paid $39.22 to win. The 3-year-old colt found his way into the Derby with a third-place finish in the Arkansas Derby and a win in the Southwest Stakes, both at Oaklawn.\n\nMystik Dan probably will have a rematch with the Arkansas Derby winner, Muth, in two weeks at the Preakness.\n\nFierceness, the favorite, finished 15th, proving he might well be a \"bounce\" horse, meaning he runs well every other race.\n\nThe race was also a coming-of-age party for Japanese horses. Forever Young finished third and T O Password was fifth.\n\nThe final order of finish was Mystik Dan, Sierra Leone, Forever Young, Catching Freedom, T O Password, Resilience, Stronghold, Honor Marie, Endlessly, Dornach, Track Phantom, West Saratoga, Domestic Product, Epic Ride, Fierceness, Society Man, Just Steel, Grand Mo the First, Catalytic and Just a Touch.\n\nTrack officials were hoping to avoid the distractions that came with the last few Derbies and for the most part were successful. Last year there was a severe spike in fatalities including two horses on Derby Day. The track eventually had to stop racing and move the meet to Ellis Park, which is also owned by Churchill Downs. No singular cause for the fatalities was ever discovered.\n\nThere is also the ongoing saga of Churchill Downs vs. Bob Baffert. The Hall of Fame trainer was suspended for two years after provisional 2021 winner Medina Spirit tested positive for legal medication, but not legal on race day. Baffert was thought to be coming back this year, but Churchill unexpectedly added at least one more year to his suspension. Churchill said Baffert did not show enough contrition and didn't take responsibility for the positive.\n\nOn the eve of this year's entry deadline, Amr Zedan, one of Baffert's owners, sued Churchill Downs to try to get his horse, Muth, into the Derby. The litigation failed on both the district and appellate level.\n\nIt would have been a circus like none other if Baffert had won the case and showed up at Churchill Downs sucking up all the oxygen from what the track was hoping would be the celebration surrounding its 150th running of the race.\n\nAnd for insiders, there was the looming potential change of the television landscape. Since 2001 the Kentucky Derby has been on NBC but the contract was set to expire after next year. Fox has made a big push to get into the racing scene and outbid NBC for the Belmont, which it did for the first time last year. It also purchased 25% of NYRA Bets, the advance deposit wagering arm of the New York Racing Assn. But, on Saturday afternoon, it was announced that a deal had been reached to keep the Derby at NBC until 2032.\n\nAll in all, a pretty good week for Churchill and an even better one for McPeek and Hernandez.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Oaks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Oaks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Baffert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Baffert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaklawn_Racing_Casino_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oaklawn Racing Casino Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winston Churchill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amr_Zedan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amr Zedan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina_Spirit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medina Spirit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Park_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ellis Park Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Racing_and_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Racing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Racing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/la_times_articles_853/c64cb15259d8c1beb8a2802daa718688", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539947", "eventUri": "eng-9539947", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

But that depends on who is doing the calling and where he is sitting.\n\nOn Saturday, Brian Hernandez Jr., a 38-year-old jockey out of Lafayette, La., wasn't riding a horse. He was locked in a dream path to victory that only could have been mapped out by whatever mythological jockey had been given a free pass to ride Pegasus.\n\nTrainer Kenny McPeek, who had put Hernandez aboard horses in Friday's Kentucky Oaks -- the premier race for 3-year-old fillies -- and Saturday's Kentucky Derby, had said, \"Why not win both?\"\n\nAnd after capturing the Oaks on Friday with Thorpedo Anna in a wire-to-wire victory by 4 3/4 lengths, Hernandez had a revelation as he rode 18-1 Mystik Dan down the stretch at historic Churchill Downs a few minutes after 7 p.m. on Saturday: \"I have a chance to win the Kentucky Derby!\"\n\nMcPeek is a believer in the near-impossible. After all, in 2002, he ran Sarava in the Belmont Stakes at odds of 70-1 and cashed a record Belmont payout.\n\nAs he rode Mystik Dan toward the finish, all the luck in this race was stuffed in Hernandez's back pocket. He cleared the treacherous 20-horse gate safely at the start. He saved ground and earned position.\n\nHe slid past favorite Fierceness along the rail at the final turn and held off Sierra Leone and Forever Young by a nose in an epic three-horse photo finish.\n\nMystik Dan got so close to the rail that Hernandez's boot struck it, \"but I think we can buy another pair of boots,\" he said. Sure, have a pair custom-made: The winner's share of the record $5 million purse is $3.1 million, with the jockey and trainer typically earning 10% each.\n\nBut after he crossed the finish line, Hernandez still wasn't sure he had won until he saw the replay of the finish. He kept his eyes glued to the flat screen that showed the continuous loop, waiting for the official decision.\n\n\"I'm like, 'Woo, I think we just won the Kentucky Derby,'\" Hernandez, 38, said. \"But then those horses, they were so far out there, you couldn't really see them. And then they surged so quickly.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh, man, I hope we won. I hope we won.' And then when they hung up our number, it was just instant relief.\"\n\nHernandez is the first jockey to complete the Derby-Oaks double since Hall of Fame jockey Calvin Borel did it aboard Mine That Bird and filly Rachel Alexandra, respectively, in 2009. McPeek became the first trainer to earn the double since Ben Jones in 1952.\n\n\"We came into the weekend thinking we had really good chances both Friday and Saturday,\" Hernandez said. \"To have the horses pull it off for us, we really have to thank all the guys back in the barn. I don't know how long it's going to take to sink in. It's definitely a surreal moment.\"\n\nIt was just the 10th Kentucky Derby (of 150) decided by a nose -- the closest margin in horse racing -- and the first since Grindstone wore the garland of red roses in 1996. But before the stewards could make it official, they had to review the entire race.\n\nHad a foul been committed when the second and third contenders slammed each on the outside before they got back in the race?\n\n\"The longest few minutes of my life,\" Hernandez said, after he and bay colt walked in circles while the result was settled. \"To see your number flash up to win the Derby, I don't think it will sink in for a while.\"\n\nWhen Donna Barton, the former jockey now doing live interviews aboard a horse for NBC, rode next to his horse and listened in as one of the outriders told him, \"Close, much too close, but I think you won.\"\n\nShe asked Hernandez: \"So, what do you think?\" He was silent for an instant and then looked at the toteboard, which confirmed it. \"I just won the Kentucky Derby,\" he said.\n\nAdded McPeek later: \"Just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey and ride. Brian is one of the most underrated jockeys, but not anymore, right?\"", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarava", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sarava"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Oaks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Oaks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pegasus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_length", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse length"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lafayette,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lafayette, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lafayette, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_A._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben A.

The last jockey to do the Oaks-Derby double was Calvin Borel in 2009 with Rachel Alexandra and Mine That Bird. The last trainer to do the double was Ben Jones in 1952 with Real Delight and Hill Gail.\n\nMcPeek is only the fourth-ever trainer to do the Oaks-Derby double in the same year.\n\nAfter Friday's Kentucky Oaks was contested over a sloppy track and rain threatened throughout Saturday, the Derby was run over a fast main track at Churchill.\n\nIt didn't matter. McPeek and Hernandez won in both conditions at Churchill Downs this weekend.\n\nCatching Freedom finished in fourth. T O Password (JPN) finished in fifth. Both of the Japenese horses in this year's race placed in the top five.\n\nA $2 exacta in the Derby with Mystik Dan and Sierra Leone paid $258.56. A $1 trifecta with Mystik Dan, Sierra Leone and Forever Young (JPN) paid $1,113.84.\n\nMcPeek was previously 0 for 9 in the Derby, with his best finish being second with Tejano Run in 1995.\n\nHernandez had been 0 for 4 in the Derby, with his best finish being eighth with McCraken in 2017.\n\n\"Brian just did an amazing job,\" McPeek said post-race on NBC, praising the jockey, Hernandez, multiple times.\n\nMystik Dan (who broke from post position 3) is owned by Lance Gasaway, 4 G Racing (Brent Gasaway and Daniel Hamby. This was the first Kentucky Derby for all of Mystik Dan's owners.\n\nThe horse went off at 18-1 odds in the Derby.\n\nMystik Dan had accrued 46 Derby qualifying points, which included a third-place finish in the Grade 1 Arkansas Derby on March 30 at Oaklawn Park and a win in the Grade 3 Southwest Stakes in early February at Oaklawn Park.\n\nMystik Dan had 20-1 morning-line odds following last week's post position draw, before he was bet down to the 18-1 odds he went off at.\n\nThe horse is now 3-1-1 in seven career starts. He entered the Derby with career earnings of $641,360, a total that will significantly increase after Saturday's result.\n\nThe bay-colored horse was bred in Kentucky and was sired by Goldencents. Mystik Dan's dam was Ma'am, by Colonel John.\n\nA homebred, Mystik Dan earned his first career win at Churchill Downs last November.\n\nFierceness, the morning-line favorite and the 3-1 post-time favorite, finished in 15th.\n\nThe 2024 Derby Day attendance was 156,710 spectators at Churchill Downs, an increase of more than 6,000 fans from the crowd of 150,335 people that gathered for last year's race.\n\nIrad Ortiz Jr. dominates Derby undercard races\n\nAs always, several high-quality stakes races took place on the Derby undercard Saturday at Churchill Downs.\n\nThe early undercard races were dominated by jockey Irad Ortiz Jr., who won each of the Grade 2, $600,000 Twin Spires Turf Sprint Stakes, Grade 1, $1 million Derby City Distaff Stakes and Grade 2, $665,000 Longines Churchill Distaff Turf Mile Stakes.\n\nOrtiz won each of those races for a different trainer: Ortiz was aboard Cogburn for Steve Asmussen in a 2 1/4-length victory in the Turf Sprint, Vahva for Cherie DeVaux in a 2-length victory in the Derby City Distaff and Chili Flag (FR) for Chad Brown in a win that came by a neck in the Churchill Distaff Turf Mile.\n\nThe 88-year-old trainer D. Wayne Lukas teamed up with jockey Jaime Torres to win the Grade 2, $600,000 Pat Day Mile Stakes by 1 1/4 lengths with Seize the Grey, and trainer H. Graham Motion paired with jockey Umberto Rispoli to win the Grade 2, $600,000 American Turf Stakes with 47-1 long shot Trikari.\n\nAsmussen also won the Grade 1, $1 million Churchill Downs by 2 1/2 lengths with Gun Pilot, who was ridden by Cristian Torres.\n\n\u00a92024 Lexington Herald-Leader.

(AP) -- The second jewel of horse racing's Triple Crown could be missing 150th Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and other co-stars, quashing hopes for a rematch after the thrilling three-wide photo finish in the milestone race.\n\nTrainer Kenny McPeek and the horse's ownership wouldn't commit to whether the colt would race in the Preakness on May 18 in Baltimore, which requires a quick two-week turnaround. Mystik Dan will travel to Saratoga, New York, before they decide whether to enter him in the 1 3/16 mile Preakness.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek said Sunday morning outside his barn at Churchill Downs. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. ... So, we'll just watch him over the next week. It'll be one of those (situations) where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nTrainer Bob Baffert has told Pimlico officials that he is sending Muth and Imagination to Baltimore for the Preakness.\n\nMuth won the Arkansas Derby on March 30, when Mystik Dan finished third. Imagination was second behind Stronghold in the Santa Anita Derby on April 6.\n\nBaffert has won the Preakness eight times, including last year with National Treasure.\n\nSaratoga in upstate New York will host the Triple Crown's final race for the next three years while Belmont Park is being reconstructed. The Belmont has also been shortened to 1 1/4 miles, matching the Derby distance that Mystik Dan won by a nose over Sierra Leone and Japan-bred Forever Young in the closest three-way finish since 1947.\n\nThe five-week gap follows a more normal race schedule for many horses and some trainers might opt to head to Saratoga to acclimate horses sooner.\n\nChad Brown said Sierra Leone will skip the Preakness and leave on Monday to train at Saratoga and run in the Belmont.\n\n\"He's a real laidback horse but when we brought him out, was a little more tired than he normally is after his races,\" Brown said. \"I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nTrainer Brad Cox is watching Catching Freedom (fourth) and Just A Touch (20th) before deciding their next steps. Forever Young and fellow Japan-bred T O Password (fifth) are headed home on Tuesday.\n\nThat could leave the Preakness without some Derby star power at first glance, though it won't lack for plotlines with a number of well-rested horses expected to compete at Pimlico.\n\nAs McPeek and the owners ponder a decision, he and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. basked in a wash of congratulations for a Derby victory that put them in exclusive company.\n\nSaturday's win helped both claim rare weekend sweeps of the Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies. McPeek is just the third trainer to do that and first since Ben Jones (who did it twice) in 1952, while Hernandez is the eighth rider to achieve the feat and first since fellow Louisiana native and Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Mystik Dan just stood calm and unfazed as a cluster of onlookers took photos and selfies as workers bathed him outside the barn. He was then draped with the winner's blanket signifying his Derby win before being led back to his stall with a WWE-style title belt laying on an outer wall. Oaks-winning filly Thorpedo Anna also made a brief appearance and soaked in the attention.\n\nHernandez is preparing for his own life-changing spotlight and title after claiming the sport's marquee race. He dined with his family after the Derby but didn't sleep much, a routine that figures to go on for the next few days amid a flood of interview requests. At some point he hopes to get his mind around all that has happened, but he already has a response ready.\n\n\"When somebody asks what my profession is, I'm able to tell them I'm a professional jockey. And then the first question they normally ask is, 'Have you ever won the Kentucky Derby?'

For the veteran trainer from Lexington, last weekend permanently altered how his career will be viewed.\n\nWhen McPeek's Thorpedo Anna won the Kentucky Oaks on Friday, followed by the trainer's Mystik Dan claiming the Derby in a three-horse photo finish Saturday with Sierra Leone (second) and Forever Young (third), it pushed the Tates Creek High School graduate and University of Kentucky alum into newly rarefied air for a trainer.\n\nMcPeek became the first trainer to claim the Oaks/Derby double in the same year since Ben Jones, the iconic Calumet Farm conditioner, did it in 1952 with Real Delight (Oaks) and Hill Gail (Derby).\n\nWith Mystik Dan's Derby win following victories by the McPeek-trained Sarava in the 2002 Belmont Stakes and Swiss Skydiver in the 2020 Preakness, the trainer has now achieved the \"career Triple Crown.\"\n\n\"Goosebumps,\" McPeek said Saturday, when asked to reflect on the magnitude of his latest achievements.\n\n\u25aa Down: Chad Brown. The Kentucky Derby gods continue to torment Brown.\n\nWith the hard-closing Sierra Leone edged out of victory by Mystik Dan's nose, the trainer is now 0-for-8 in the Derby with two second-place finishes, a third, a fourth and a fifth.\n\n\"You get beat a nose in the Kentucky Derby, it's a tough one\" to take, Brown said Saturday.\n\n\u25aa Up: Brian Hernandez Jr. Long more accomplished at his craft than celebrated in his profession, the Kentucky-based jockey rewarded the faith of his longtime patron, Kenny McPeek, by riding Thorpedo Anna and Mystik Dan to their victories.\n\nThe gutty, ground-saving ride along the rail by the 38-year-old Hernandez on Mystik Dan was all but universally seen as the difference between winning and losing the Kentucky Derby. Afterward McPeek jokingly implored the media not to write about how impressive a ride it had been so other trainers won't hire Hernandez away.\n\n\"But I guess that cat is out of the bag, isn't it?\" McPeek said.\n\n\u25aa Down: John Velzaquez. When the veteran jockey booted the gritty Medina Spirit to victory in the 2021 Kentucky Derby, it moved Velazquez to an elite level in Derby history.\n\nThat victory made \"Johnny V.,\" only the fourth jockey with at least four Kentucky Derby wins, joining legends Eddie Arcaro and Bill Hartack (five each) and Bill Shoemaker (four).\n\nSubsequently, through no fault of Velazquez, the jockey lost his fourth Derby win when a postrace test showed a banned substance in the system of the Bob Baffert-trained Medina Spirit and the horse was disqualified.\n\nAt age 52, the clock is ticking on opportunities for Velazquez to \"get back\" the fourth Kentucky Derby win that he had taken away.\n\nThat had to make this year's Derby an acute disappointment for Velazquez. Riding race-time favorite Fierceness, Velazquez came home a disappointing 15th after sitting third at the mile pole in the 1 1/4-mile race.\n\n\"When I let (Fierceness) go, he just didn't have it,\" Velazquez said.\n\n\u25aa Up: Churchill Downs management. The 150th Kentucky Derby was apparently a smash hit on multiple fronts.\n\nNBC Sports announced Sunday that the 2024 Derby drew an average audience of 16.7 million viewers. According to NBC, it is the most-watched Kentucky Derby since the 1989 race averaged 18.5 million viewers.\n\nMeanwhile, Churchill Downs announced that $210.7 million was wagered on the Derby, the first time in history that figure went above $200 million.\n\nGiven those metrics, the controversial decision made by Churchill Downs Inc. to extend the original two-year suspension of trainer Bob Baffert related to the Medina Spirit disqualification to a third Kentucky Derby does not appear to have harmed the popularity of the event.\n\n\u25aa Down: Bob Baffert. Given the above figures, the two-time Triple Crown-winning trainer does not have much leverage in his interactions with Churchill Downs.\n\n\u25aa Up: Japan. Though the two Japanese horses who contested the 150th Kentucky Derby did not produce the breakthrough Triple Crown victory that race fans in Japan yearn for, they came close.\n\nThe previously unbeaten Forever Young fought gamely but was squeezed in the middle in the three-horse battle for the race win. Meanwhile, the less highly regarded Japanese horse in the Derby, T O Password, finished a respectable fifth.\n\nWith the recent success of Japanese horses in other major international races, it seems just a matter of time before the Triple Crown win barrier is breached.\n\n\u25aa Down: Martha Stewart. Given the honor of performing the \"Rider's Up\" call for the historically significant 150th Derby, the lifestyle guru and businesswoman nearly committed the verbal faux pas of referring to \"Kentucky\" as \"Connecticut.\"\n\n\"Racing fans from around the world, the city of Louisville and the Commonwealth of Conn -- Kentucky,\" Stewart said in her remarks.\n\nThe subsequent roasting Stewart took on the social media platform X was, I thought, out of proportion to her \"offense.\"\n\nNevertheless, given the magnitude of Derby 150, I think those who were asking why Churchill Downs did not have a celebrity of national import with direct ties to the state of Kentucky perform the \"Rider's Up\" call have a point.", "source": {"uri": "kentucky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexington Herald Leader"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_story@kentucky.com", "name": "Mark Story", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bay (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2002 Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Skydiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swiss Skydiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina_Spirit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medina Spirit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_A._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben A.

(AP) -- The second jewel of horse racing's Triple Crown could be missing 150th Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and other co-stars, quashing hopes for a rematch after the thrilling three-wide photo finish in the milestone race.\n\nTrainer Kenny McPeek and the horse's ownership wouldn't commit to whether the colt would race in the 149th Preakness on May 18 in Baltimore, which requires a quick two-week turnaround. Mystik Dan will travel to Saratoga, New York, before they decide whether to enter him in the 1 3/16 mile Preakness.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek said Sunday morning outside his barn on Churchill Downs' back side. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. ... So, we'll just watch him over the next week. It'll be one of those (situations) where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nThe picturesque track in upstate New York will host the Triple Crown's final jewel for the next three years while Belmont Park is being reconstructed. The Belmont has also been shortened to a 1 1/4 mile, matching the Derby distance that Mystik Dan won by a nose over Sierra Leone and Japan-bred Forever Young in the closest three-way finish since 1947.\n\nThe five-week gap follows a more normal race schedule for many thoroughbreds and some trainers might opt to head to Saratoga to acclimate horses sooner.\n\nChad Brown said Sierra Leone will skip the Preakness and leave on Monday to train at Saratoga and run the Belmont. Considering how much it took for Sierra Leone to navigate other horses and chase down Mystik Dan before falling a nose short at the wire, rest sounds necessary.\n\n\"He's a real laid back horse but when we brought him out, was a little more tired than he normally is after his races,\" Brown said. \"I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nLouisville-born trainer Brad Cox is watching Catching Freedom (fourth) and Just A Touch (20th) before deciding their next steps. Forever Young and fellow Japan-bred T O Password (fifth) are headed home on Tuesday.\n\nThat could leave the Preakness without some Derby star power at first glance, though it won't lack for plotlines with a number of well-rested horses expected to compete at Pimlico Race Course.\n\nHall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert could have two entrants as he seeks to follow up National Treasure's victory there last spring. He trains Santa Anita Derby runner-up Imagination and Arkansas Derby winner Muth, who missed the Derby after failed legal attempts by owner Amr Zedan to get him in despite Baffert's suspension by Churchill Downs through the end of 2024.\n\nAs McPeek and the owners ponder a decision, he and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. basked in a wash of congratulations for a Derby victory that put them in exclusive company.\n\nSaturday's win helped both claim rare weekend sweeps of the Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies.

Hernandez wasn't even sure he had won until seeing the replay and keeping his eyes glued to the flat screen that showed the continuous loop.\n\n\"I'm like, woo, I think we just won the Kentucky Derby,\" the 38-year-old said. \"But then those horses, they were so far out there, you couldn't really see them. And then they surged so quickly.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh man, I hope we won. I hope we won.' And then when they hung up our number, it was just instant relief.\"\n\nRELATED: Mystik Dan wins 150th Kentucky Derby\n\nHernandez's derby victory aboard Mystik Dan at 18-1 odds came a day after he rode filly Thorpedo Anna to a wire-to-wire rout by 4 3/4 lengths in the 150th Kentucky Oaks. That made him the first jockey to complete the Derby/Oaks double since Hall of Famer Calvin Borel achieved the feat aboard Mine That Bird and filly Rachel Alexandra, respectively, in 2009. Kenny McPeek became the first trainer to earn the double since Ben Jones in 1952.\n\n\"We came into the weekend thinking we had really good chances both Friday and Saturday,\" Hernandez added. \"To have the horses pull it off for us, we really have to thank all the guys back in the barn.\n\n\"I don't know how long it's going to take to sink in. It's definitely a surreal moment.\"\n\nHernandez's victory was fitting since he studied Borel's derby wins aboard Mine That Bird and Super Saver (2010), along with being around him during 20 years of racing in Kentucky. Those lessons paid off as he broke through after four derby finishes ranging from eighth to 12th, including 11th last May on Sun Thunder.\n\nRELATED: WATCH: How Mystik Dan held off Sierra Leone, Forever Young in dramatic Kentucky Derby finish\n\nHis seminal moment shouldn't have been shocking considering Hernandez already had an Eclipse Award to his name as top apprentice rider in 2004 along with a Breeders' Cup Classic win in 2012 with Fort Larned. He also was third in the Preakness two years ago with Creative Minister and has a slew of graded stakes wins.\n\nWinning the Kentucky Derby brings a whole different type of recognition, along with a sparkling title that will precede Hernandez for the rest of his life. McPeek asserted immediately afterward that the rider can no longer be considered underrated after a \"brilliant\" ride and called the gutsy inside path taken to victory typical for the jockey.\n\n\"He knows what to do there,\" McPeek said. \"I always had a world of confidence in him. Rarely second-guess anything he does.\"\n\nHowever, the victory created a travel issue for Hernandez, who had planned on head to Louisiana on Sunday morning for a jazz festival. It's a switch he was more than willing to make after two remarkable days that demonstrated what the right mounts can yield.\n\n\"You know, it's horse racing, it's not jockey racing,\" said Hernandez, who planned to celebrate with his wife on Saturday night. \"Just about any jockey out there, if they have the right horse, they can get them to the winner's circle. You just you have to be willing to put in the time and the effort to find the right horses.\"", "source": {"uri": "wthr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTHR-TV 13 NBC Indianapolis"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wthr.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mine_That_Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mine That Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_A._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben A.

Mystik Dan will travel to Saratoga, N.Y., before they decide whether to enter him in the 1 3/16-mile Preakness.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek said Sunday morning outside his barn at Churchill Downs. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. ... So, we'll just watch him over the next week. It'll be one of those (situations) where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nTrainer Bob Baffert has told Pimlico officials that he is sending Muth and Imagination to Baltimore for the Preakness.\n\nMuth won the Arkansas Derby on March 30, when Mystik Dan finished third. Imagination was second behind Stronghold in the Santa Anita Derby on April 6.\n\nBaffert has won the Preakness eight times, including last year with National Treasure.\n\nSaratoga in upstate New York will host the Triple Crown's final race for the next three years while Belmont Park is being reconstructed. The Belmont has also been shortened to 1\u00bc miles, matching the Derby distance that Mystik Dan won by a nose ahead of Sierra Leone and Japan-bred Forever Young in the closest three-way finish since 1947.\n\nThe five-week gap follows a more normal race schedule for many horses and some trainers might opt to head to Saratoga to acclimate horses sooner.\n\nChad Brown said Sierra Leone will skip the Preakness and leave today to train at Saratoga and run in the Belmont.\n\n\"He's a real laidback horse but when we brought him out, was a little more tired than he normally is after his races,\" Brown said. \"I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nTrainer Brad Cox is watching Catching Freedom (fourth) and Just A Touch (20th) before deciding their next steps. Forever Young and fellow Japan-bred T O Password (fifth) are headed home Tuesday.\n\nThat could leave the Preakness without some Derby star power at first glance, though it won't lack for plotlines with a number of well-rested horses expected to compete at Pimlico.\n\nAs McPeek and the owners ponder a decision, he and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. basked in a wash of congratulations for a Derby victory that put them in exclusive company.\n\nSaturday's win helped both claim rare weekend sweeps of the Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies. McPeek is just the third trainer to do that and first since Ben Jones (who did it twice) in 1952, while Hernandez is the eighth rider to achieve the feat and first since fellow Louisiana native and Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Mystik Dan just stood calm and unfazed as a cluster of onlookers took photos and selfies as workers bathed him outside the barn.

Jones did it with Oaks winner Real Delight and Derby winner Hill Gail.\n\n\"Wow,\" McPeek said Saturday when asked about the feat.\n\n\"For three weeks, I felt like we were going to win both races, I can't tell you why,\" he said. \"I believe in mojo. I believe in positive energy, and we had a lot of that.\"\n\nBrian Hernandez Jr. became the first jockey to win both the Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby since Calvin Borel in 2009 on Rachel Alexandra in the Oaks and Mine That Bird in the Derby.\n\nThe son of Goldencents had won the Southwest Stakes by 8 lengths on a muddy track Feb. 3 at Oaklawn but had finished third behind Muth and Just Steel in the Arkansas Derby on May 30 at Oaklawn.\n\n\"I'm pinching myself, wondering if this is real,\" part-owner Lance Gasaway said. \"You just won the biggest horse race in America. Who would have dreamed it.\"\n\nThe 61-year-old McPeek won the 2002 Belmont Stakes with Sarava and the 2020 Preakness with the filly Swiss Skydiver, but he was 0 for 9 in his home state's famous race. His best finish was second with Tejano Run all the way back in 1995.\n\nIt was a heartbreaking loss for the connections of Sierra Leone, who had won the Toyota Blue Grass Stakes on April 6 at Keeneland. With a deep closing running style, Sierra Leone made a strong move to the finish but came up a nose short.\n\n\"It's a tough one,\" said Chad Brown, trainer of Sierra Leone. \"It's professional sport. When you're at this level you're going to win some and lose some, and often times it's a game of inches.\"\n\nThe previously unbeaten Forever Young was attempting to be the first Japanese-bred horse to win the Kentucky Derby. In the middle between Mystik Dan and Sierra Leone, Forever Young finished third.\n\nThe finish was a terrific ending to a terrific day that included Churchill showing off its new $200 million paddock for a group of celebrities including Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl champion tight end and Taylor Swift boyfriend Travis Kelce, Martha Stewart (who nearly misspoke during the traditional \"Riders Up\" command by saying the \"Commonwealth of Connecticut\"), \"Tonight Show\" host Jimmy Fallon, new Kentucky basketball coach Mark Pope and now former UK basketball star Reed Sheppard, among others.\n\nFriday's Kentucky Oaks was contested over a sloppy track. The Churchill surface was listed as muddy for the opening races Saturday but had dried to a fast track with a temperature of 80 degrees by the 6:57 p.m. post time for the Kentucky Derby.\n\nThis was the third consecutive Kentucky Derby without trainer Bob Baffert, who has a record-tying six Derby victories to his credit, including a pair of Triple Crown winners (American Pharoah in 2015, Justify in 2018).\n\nThe California-based Baffert initially was suspended for two years after his trainee Medina Spirit hit the finish line first in the 2021 Kentucky Derby only to be disqualified after testing positive for Betamethasone, banned on race day. Last July, Churchill Downs, Inc. extended Baffert's suspension through 2024 for what it said was the trainer continuing \"to peddle a false narrative concerning the failed drug test of Medina Spirit.\"\n\nOwner Amr Zedan opted to stick with Baffert instead of transferring his star 3-year-old Muth to an eligible trainer. After winning the Arkansas Derby, Muth is being pointed to the May 18 Preakness Stakes in Baltimore. Zedan also owned Medina Spirit.\n\nBut this Kentucky Derby Day belonged to Mystik Dan and McPeek, the trainer who had earned his 2,000th victory as a trainer back in February. But for the Tates Creek High School and University of Kentucky graduate to finally win the Kentucky Derby was a dream come true.\n\n\"It means everything,\" McPeek said. \"It's been an amazing journey.\"", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@triblive.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Oaks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Oaks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_A._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ben A.

In one of the closest finishes in almost 30 years, Mystik Dan won the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby.\n\nThe horse was generally overlooked by most but he ran a smart race on the rail and poked his head in front in the final strides to hold off Sierra Leone and Forever Young in the blanket finish.\n\nIt also completed a rare double for trainer Kenny McPeek and jockey Brian Hernandez, who also won the Kentucky Oaks on Friday with Thorpedo Anna. It was only the fourth time that has been done.\n\n\"That was the longest few minutes in my life I've spent waiting for them to hang the dang number up,\" Hernandez said.\n\nMcPeek was effusive with his praise for Hernandez.\n\n\"Brian did an amazing job,\" McPeek said. \"He's just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey. He's probably one of the most underrated riders in the business. But not anymore.\"\n\nMystik Dan paid $39.22 to win.\n\nThe 3-year-old colt found his way to Churchill Downs with a third-place finish in the Arkansas Derby and a win in the Southwest Stakes, both at Oaklawn.\n\nMystik Dan likely will have a rematch with the Arkansas Derby winner, Muth, in two weeks at the Preakness.\n\nFierceness, the favorite, finished 15th, proving he may well be a \"bounce\" horse, running well every other race.\n\nThe race was also a coming-of-age party for Japanese horses. Forever Young finished third and T O Password was fifth.\n\nThe final order of finish was Mystik Dan, Sierra Leone, Forever Young, Catching Freedom, T O Password, Resilience, Stronghold, Honor Marie, Endlessly, Dornach, Track Phantom, West Saratoga, Domestic Product, Epic Ride, Fierceness, Society Man, Just Steel, Grand Mo the First, Catalytic and Just a Touch.\n\nTrack officials were hoping to avoid the distractions that came with the last few Derbies and for the most part were successful. Last year there was a severe spike in fatalities, including two horses on Derby Day. The track eventually had to stop racing and move the meet to Ellis Park, which is also owned by Churchill Downs. No singular cause for the fatalities was discovered.\n\nThere is also the ongoing saga of Churchill Downs versus Bob Baffert. The Hall of Fame trainer was suspended for two years after provisional 2021 winner Medina Spirit tested positive for legal medication that is not allowed on race day. Baffert was thought to be coming back this year but Churchill Downs unexpectedly added at least one more year to his suspension. Churchill Downs officials said that Baffert did not show enough contrition and didn't take responsibility for the positive test.\n\nOn the eve of this year's entry deadline, Amr Zedan, an owner of horses Baffert trains, sued Churchill Downs to try and get his horse Muth into the Derby. The litigation failed on both the district and appellate level.\n\nIt would have been a circus like none other if Baffert had won the case and showed up at Churchill Downs, sucking up all the oxygen from what the track was hoping would be the celebration surrounding its 150th running of the race.\n\nAnd for insiders, there was the looming potential change of the television landscape. Since 2001 the Kentucky Derby has been on NBC but the contract was set to expire after next year.

In one of the closest finishes in almost 30 years, Mystik Dan won the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby.\n\nThe horse was generally overlooked by most but he ran a smart race on the rail and poked his head in front in the final strides to hold off Sierra Leone and Forever Young in the blanket finish.\n\nIt also completed a rare double for trainer Kenny McPeek and jockey Brian Hernandez, who also won the Kentucky Oaks on Friday with Thorpedo Anna. It was only the fourth time that has been done.\n\n\"That was the longest few minutes in my life I've spent waiting for them to hang the dang number up,\" Hernandez said.\n\nMcPeek was effusive with his praise for Hernandez.\n\n\"Brian did an amazing job,\" McPeek said. \"He's just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey. He's probably one of the most underrated riders in the business. But not anymore.\"\n\nMystik Dan paid $39.22 to win.\n\nThe 3-year-old colt found his way to Churchill Downs with a third-place finish in the Arkansas Derby and a win in the Southwest Stakes, both at Oaklawn.\n\nMystik Dan likely will have a rematch with the Arkansas Derby winner, Muth, in two weeks at the Preakness.\n\nFierceness, the favorite, finished 15th, proving he may well be a \"bounce\" horse, running well every other race.\n\nThe race was also a coming-of-age party for Japanese horses. Forever Young finished third and T O Password was fifth.\n\nThe final order of finish was Mystik Dan, Sierra Leone, Forever Young, Catching Freedom, T O Password, Resilience, Stronghold, Jonor Marie, Endlessly, Dornach, Track Phantom, West Saratoga, Domestic Product, Epic Ride, Fierceness, Society Man, Just Steel, Grand Mo the First, Catalytic and Just a Touch.\n\nTrack officials were hoping to avoid the distractions that came with the last few Derbies and for the most part were successful. Last year there was a severe spike in fatalities, including two horses on Derby Day. The track eventually had to stop racing and move the meet to Ellis Park, which is also owned by Churchill Downs. No singular cause for the fatalities was discovered.\n\nThere is also the ongoing saga of Churchill Downs vs. Bob Baffert. The Hall of Fame trainer was suspended for two years after provisional 2021 winner Medina Spirit tested positive for legal medication that is not allowed on race day. Baffert was thought to be coming back this year but Churchill Downs unexpectedly added at least one more year to his suspension. Churchill Downs officials said that Baffert did not show enough contrition and didn't take responsibility for the positive test.\n\nOn the eve of this year's entry deadline, Amr Zedan, an owner of horses Baffert trains, sued Churchill Downs to try and get his horse Muth into the Derby. The litigation failed on both the district and appellate level.\n\nIt would have been a circus like none other if Baffert had won the case and showed up at Churchill Downs, sucking up all the oxygen from what the track was hoping would be the celebration surrounding its 150th running of the race.\n\nAnd for insiders, there was the looming potential change of the television landscape. Since 2001 the Kentucky Derby has been on NBC but the contract was set to expire after next year. Fox has made a big push to get into the racing scene and outbid NBC for the Belmont Stakes, which it did for the first time last year. It also purchased 25% of NYRA Bets, the advance deposit wagering arm of the New York Racing Assn.\n\nBut, on Saturday afternoon, it was announced that a deal had been reached to keep the Kentucky Derby on NBC until 2032.\n\nAll in all, a pretty good week for Churchill and an even better one for McPeek and Hernandez.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles

The show horse, Forever Young, cost his owners $760,000.\n\nA day earlier, Hernandez kicked home the McPeek-trained Thorpedo Anna -- winner of Oaklawn's Fantasy Stakes -- in a wire-to-wire, front-running win, making McPeek the first trainer in 72 years to win both the Oaks and the Derby.\n\nThe Gasaways own 4 G Racing and before Saturday's triumph had won a handful of races, but today they are owners of the No. 1 horse in the world.\n\nMystik Dan got bumped in the Arkansas Derby but still managed to get the show money and enough points to qualify for the Kentucky Derby.\n\nHe came out of that race in good shape though, and apparently there was never any doubt his next race would be in Louisville.\n\nMystik Dan was an 18-1 long shot.\n\nPeople come from all over the world for the Derby, not just fans of the fastest two minutes in sports, but jockeys and horses.\n\nIt may be the most diverse jockey colony in the world.\n\nThe Kentucky Derby is more than the No. 1 horse race each year, it is a party, a social gathering and a fundraiser (mostly for Churchill Downs Inc.). It is an event so big NBC covers it for almost five hours.\n\nIt was a tough but great card Saturday and had horses competing against each other named U.S. Army and Five Star General -- neither came close to the winner's circle.\n\nIn the Turf Classic that preceded the 150th Kentucky Derby, Naval Power, who was from Argentina, powered to the lead in the stretch to get beat at the wire by Program Training, who has lost just once in his previous five starts.\n\nThen came the long wait for the Run for the Roses to give every bettor a chance to place a bet like it was the last horse race they would ever wager on.\n\nWith a field of 20, the favorite Fierceness was at 3-1, the longest odds he had seen this year. The only time the winner of the Florida Derby by more than 13 lengths hasn't been favored was last year in the Breeder's Cup Juvenile, when he went off at 16-1 and won by more than six lengths.\n\nEven if he had finished better, he probably would have been taken down for interfering with Forever Young.\n\nOnly one horse in the field had won more money than Fierceness and that was Forever Young with more than $2 million in earnings. He came all the from Japan and he was 6-1. The other shipper from Japan was T O Password and he was 47-1. Both come from the bloodline of Ferdinand, who won the 1986 Derby.\n\nMystik Dan, his jockey, trainer and owners shocked the world of racing, and it put Oaklawn smack dab in the middle of the argument of which track has the best racing.", "source": {"uri": "arkansasonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArkansasOnline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Asking. Urging. Begging. With two other horses shrinking the distance separating them from the leader with every stride, fighting each other, until the three are almost one, and a crowd the size of a small city making a sound like an airplane climbing into the pale blue sky. With the finish line arriving, the trio inseparable. And with the roar becoming a wondrous, unknowing gasp, an exhalation that is equal parts uncertainty and joy, a sound at the heart of an ancient game.\n\nSo it was on Saturday at Churchill Downs in the rare American horse race that truly matters, that Mystik Dan, a bay colt sent off at 18-1 odds, shot into the lead along the rail at the quarter pole, a move that 38-year-old veteran Kentucky jockey Brian Hernandez learned from watching three-time Derby winner Calvin Borel, and galloped into open space, tantalizingly close to the wire but painfully far away. Behind him, Sierra Leone, at 5-1 the second choice in the 20-horse field, and Forever Young, the latest Japan-based horse to try to win the Derby's roses, tried to run him down. As soon as they hit the line, as Sierra Leone edged past Forever Young, the PHOTO sign was illuminated on the infield tote boards and on hundreds of monitors around the mammoth racetrack.\n\nAnd then... everyone waited. Mystik Dan's Churchill-based trainer, Kenny McPeek, who has won the Preakness and Belmont Stakes in a long and circuitous career, but never the Derby, was in his box near the finish. Chad Brown, Sierra Leone's four-time Eclipse Award-winning trainer, winner of nearly every significant race in American thoroughbred racing, was nearby in his. The typical Derby throng, this year 156,170 fans, waited in seats and boxes and concourses at the end of a long day.\n\nReplays were shown on monitors. Mystik Dan looked like the winner. Then a slow-motion replay was shown. Maybe not. Very close to the line, Mystik Dan's head rose as Sierra Leone's fell. A bob, they say in racing. Was it enough?\n\n\"I didn't think I won, watching it live,\" said Brown after the race. \"Then they showed the slo-mo, I thought maybe this could be a dead heat. Because I got a great (head) bob. I just wasn't in front. But it's tough to know which angles they're showing.\"\n\nMcPeek said, \"I thought we won when we hit the wire. There was a monitor sitting right behind us. Somebody pointed it out. They slo-mo'd it to the wire. I thought it was pretty obvious we won.\"\n\nTwo minutes passed. Three minutes. On the backstretch, Hernandez pulled up Mystik Dan and asked his outrider. \"The outrider said we think you won,\" said Hernandez. \"But they haven't made it official yet.\"\n\nFour minutes. There's nothing like this in racing, and few things like it anywhere in sports. Horses and riders have spent themselves. Owners and trainers have worked months for the Derby. Now the outcome is delayed. Bettors clutch tickets to their hearts; some will be cashed, others worthless. The day is over, but it's not over. It is a delay not at all like the 22 minutes after the end of the 2019 Derby, when an ominous sense of unsatisfying justice hung in the air before winner Maximum Security -- clearly the best horse that day -- was appropriately disqualified from first place, \"taken down\" in racing parlance, and plodding closer Country House declared a tepid, longshot winner. This was different. This was a delay worth living, an agony that makes the reward more meaningful.\n\nFive minutes.\n\nFinally. OFFICIAL replaced PHOTO on the boards and monitors. Another roar. Mystik Dan, a homebred owned and bred by an Arkansas group led by former small college football player Lance Gasaway and his wife, Sherilyn, had won the 150th Kentucky Derby by the margin of a nose over Sierra Leone. It was the closest Derby finish since 1996, when Grindstone ran down Cavonnier and also won by a nose, denying a first Derby win to an unknown, white-haired California trainer named Bob Baffert, who has since won the Derby six times and whose absence -- while in the third year of a Derby suspension levied by Churchill Downs -- from Saturday's race was conspicuous, but somehow less meaningful in the jetstream of such an enervating moment. It was the Derby's first three-horse photo finish since Jet Pilot, Phalanx and Faultless in 1947.\n\nWith Mystik Dan's victory, McPeek became the first trainer since Ben Jones in 1952 to win both the Kentucky Oaks for three-year-old fillies, which McPeek won Friday with Thorpedo Anna, and the Derby. He had predicted the win in his Oaks press conference the day before, when asked if he would be returning to the winning chair a day later. \"Count on it,\" McPeek said. After the Derby, he said, \"For three weeks, I've felt like we were going to win both races. I can't tell you why. Both horses have been so easy to deal with. There's been no drama. And we had two really good horses.\"\n\nA moment: One good horse race does not rescue a sport. Racing's wounds are deep and will not heal quickly. It was a year ago that the Derby unfolded as the first chapter in a months-long crisis that -- absent aggressive intervention and change -- had the potential to push the sport of racing closer to irrelevance and within range of extinction. Five thoroughbreds suffered catastrophic breakdowns and were euthanized in the 10 days leading to the Derby, and two more in races on the Derby undercard. Five horses were scratched from the body of the race, the most since 1936. Trainer Saffie Joseph, Jr. was suspended because two of his horses were among the dead (he was back in the Derby this year) and Hall of Fame trainer Todd Pletcher was bigfooted by a state veterinarian, when the vet scratched Pletcher's likely favorite Forte on the morning of the Derby.\n\nIt was a lousy week and a lousy day, and while 15-1 shot Mage's victory and his connections' rollicking infield celebration brought a moment of joy and relief (as did the entire Derby field finishing safely), it couldn't undo what had come before it. The Derby shuffled offstage, diminished in its present, less reliable as an antidote to any and all issues in the sport. The rest of the year was no better: Two weeks after the Derby, the Preakness was differently fraught, but no less painfully. Three-year-old Havnameltdown suffered a gruesome breakdown approaching the homestretch in the Chick Lang Stakes and was euthanized on the track; a few hours later National Treasure won a thrilling Preakness. The catch: Both were trained by Baffert.\n\nTwo more horses died on the track on the day of the Belmont Stakes, bringing the Triple Crown Day tally to five. Across the 40 days of the glossy Saratoga summer meet, 13 horses died in racing or training, including beloved filly Maple Leaf Mel's horrific collapse just short of the finish line on a Saturday with more than 44,000 sun-soaked spectators watching aghast. The sport was reeling, society beginning to turn away.\n\nChurchill Downs took steps. First, the track shut down its 2023 spring meet a month early, on June 2, and reopened in the fall. Horses competing in the Derby were subjected to rigorous daily attention by a team of veterinarians, charged with ensuring their soundness. They trained with biometric sensors designed to detect changes in gait that might indicate the beginnings of an injury. Upgraded surface maintenance equipment was put into use, a no-stone-unturned strategy to counter consistent findings that breakdown clusters are in some way connected to track surfaces. A PET scan unit was installed at the track.\n\nAnd, the kicker. There were no catastrophic breakdowns during Derby week, or on Derby Day. Is that because of the measures Churchill took to improve horse safety? Or did the roulette wheel of random outcomes simply spare the track, the race and the sport this year, after punishing it a year ago? It's impossible to know in real time. And a clean week does not arrest years of unattended slippage and tragedy. But this is unequivocally true: Zero dead horses is better than seven dead horses. And the recovery has to begin somewhere.\n\nIt could do worse than to begin with Mystik Dan. With McPeek. With Gasaway. With Hernandez.\n\nMystik Dan was born in 2021 to Gasaway's mare, Ma'am, a blue-collar daughter of one-time Derby starter Colonel John, who won four times in 23 career starts, totaling $167,923, mostly in claiming and low-level allowance races, never in a stakes race. She did not scream broodmare, but Gasaway bred her to 2013 and 2014 Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile winner Goldencents for a meager $10,000 stallion fee, and, voila. Gasaway marveled at all of it. \"I mean, who would have ever dreamed that a little filly, Ma'am, breed her for a $10,000 stud fee, and win the Kentucky Derby. It's just really surreal.\"\n\nMystik Dan, who was named for one of Gasaway's partners, Dan Hamby, and Hamby's father's work as a salesman for Mystik Tape, took an uncertain route to the Derby, via Arkansas. He was just fifth in January's Smarty Jones, but won the February Southwest Stakes by eight lengths. A third in the March 30 Arkansas Derby earned him enough points to make the Derby starting gate. Hernandez had ridden him in all but the desultory Smarty Jones. \"He just doesn't make mistakes,\" said McPeek. \"I go to big races and use other jockeys and say, 'I miss Brian.'\"\n\nHernandez is a rider's rider; his mounts have won $127 million in purses in 22 years, but he's never become famous. His Derby ride was a virtuoso performance. A week before the Derby, Mystik Dan drew the No. 3 post position in the 20-horse Derby field, which can be problematic. Hernandez turned it into an advantage and summoned his memory of his friend and Derby legend. Borel won the 2007 Derby with Street Sense, the 2009 Derby with Mine That Bird and the 2010 Derby with Super Saver, all with rail-skimming rides, true to his nickname of Calvin Bo-rail. When Hernandez drew the three hole, he watched those rides.\n\n\"Twenty years I've ridden here, I sat in the same corner as Calvin Borel. I got to watch him ride those Derbies. I said, 'You know what? We're going to roll the dice [and ride the rail].'\" It worked perfectly.

He did, too, after a delay of several minutes while the closest three-horse photo finish since 1947 was sorted out.\n\nThat year, Jet Pilot won by a head over Phalanx and a length ahead of Faultless.\n\nMystik Dan, an 18-1 shot, edged Sierra Leone by a nose, with Forever Young another nose back in third on Saturday. Sierra Leone was the most expensive horse in the race at $2.3 million.\n\nLong shots Track Phantom and Just Steel led the field through the early going, with 3-1 favorite Fierceness racing three-wide just off the leaders.\n\nAt the top of the stretch, everything changed.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He quickly opened up a daylight advantage on the field.\n\n\"When he shot through that spot, he was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it,\" Hernandez said. \"He shot off and I'm like, 'Oh man, I've got a big chance to win the Kentucky Derby.'\"\n\nTo Mystik Dan's outside, Sierra Leone and Forever Young took up the chase in the middle of the track.\n\nAs Mystik Dan sped along the rail, Sierra Leone lugged in and bumped Forever Young three times in the stretch, but jockey Ryusei Sakai didn't claim foul.\n\nMystik Dan got so close to the rail that Hernandez's boot struck it.\n\n\"But I think we can buy another pair of boots,\" he said.\n\nThe winner's share of the record $5 million purse was $3.1 million, with the jockey and trainer typically earning 10% each.\n\n\"Just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey and ride,\" McPeek said. \"Brian is one of the most underrated jockeys, but not anymore, right?\"\n\nSierra Leone, the second choice at 9-2 odds, and Forever Young from Japan came up just short at the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs, the largest crowd since 2018.\n\nIt was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- the closest margin in horse racing -- and the first since Grindstone edged Cavonnier to wear the garland of red roses in 1996.\n\nThe crowd waited several minutes in the heat and humidity as the result was reviewed by the stewards and declared official.\n\n\"The longest few minutes of my life,\" Hernandez said, after he and Mystik Dan walked in circles while the stunning result was settled. \"To see your number flash up to win the Derby, I don't think it will sink in for a while.\"\n\nFierceness finished 15th in the field of 20 3-year-olds. Owner Mike Repole is 0 for 8 in the derby. He had the favorite in 2011 with Uncle Mo, who was scratched the day before the race with an illness. Last year, Forte was scratched the morning of the race as the favorite with a bruised foot.\n\nMystik Dan ran 1\u00bc miles over a fast track in 2:03.34 and paid $39.22, $16.32 and $10.\n\nLove 0

Forever Young was another nose back in third and paid $5.58 to show.\n\nSierra Leone lugged in and bumped Forever Young three times in the stretch, but jockey Ryusei Sakai didn't claim foul.\n\nAP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing\n\nMore from this section\n\nCitizens Commission on Human Rights Demands the European Psychiatric Association Bring an End to Coercive Psychiatry WellVisor Partners with FlexCare Digital Health to Expand Services for Clients Church of Scientology Hosts Inner City Shakespeare Ensemble: Young Actors Present Blow-Away Performance of Their PG Version of 'Grease'", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "beth_harris@kulr8.com", "name": "Beth Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forever_Young_(Alphaville_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forever Young (Alphaville song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bay (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Oaks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Oaks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grease_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grease (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Scientology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Church of Scientology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Shakespeare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Fairs_and_Expos", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Fairs and Expos", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kulr8.com/content/tncms/custom/image/ebec0578-57d0-11ee-978f-b7da313020af.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539947", "eventUri": "eng-9539947", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

(AP) - Brian Hernandez Jr. will need a minute to digest his signature victory in the 150th Kentucky Derby.\n\nMaybe even more time since the milestone derby capped the best weekend of a jockey career spent mostly under the radar.\n\nThe Louisiana native rode Mystik Dan to an epic win Saturday at Churchill Downs, sliding past favorite Fierceness along the rail at the final turn and holding off Sierra Leone and Forever Young by a nose in an epic three-horse photo finish. Hernandez wasn\u00b4t even sure he had won until seeing the replay and keeping his eyes glued to the flat screen that showed the continuous loop.\n\n\"I\u00b4m like, woo, I think we just won the Kentucky Derby,\" the 38-year-old said. \"But then those horses, they were so far out there, you couldn\u00b4t really see them. And then they surged so quickly.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh man, I hope we won. I hope we won.\u00b4 And then when they hung up our number, it was just instant relief.\"\n\nHernandez\u00b4s derby victory aboard Mystik Dan at 18-1 odds came a day after he rode filly Thorpedo Anna to a wire-to-wire rout by 4 3/4 lengths in the 150th Kentucky Oaks. That made him the first jockey to complete the Derby/Oaks double since Hall of Famer Calvin Borel achieved the feat aboard Mine That Bird and filly Rachel Alexandra, respectively, in 2009. Kenny McPeek became the first trainer to earn the double since Ben Jones in 1952.\n\nBrian Hernandez Jr. celebrates in the winner's circle after riding Mystik Dan to win the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race at Churchill Downs Saturday, May 4, 2024, in Louisville, Ky. (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)\n\n\"We came into the weekend thinking we had really good chances both Friday and Saturday,\" Hernandez added. \"To have the horses pull it off for us, we really have to thank all the guys back in the barn.\n\n\"I don\u00b4t know how long it\u00b4s going to take to sink in. It\u00b4s definitely a surreal moment.\"\n\nHernandez\u00b4s victory was fitting since he studied Borel\u00b4s derby wins aboard Mine That Bird and Super Saver (2010), along with being around him during 20 years of racing in Kentucky. Those lessons paid off as he broke through after four derby finishes ranging from eighth to 12th, including 11th last May on Sun Thunder.\n\nHis seminal moment shouldn\u00b4t have been shocking considering Hernandez already had an Eclipse Award to his name as top apprentice rider in 2004 along with a Breeders\u00b4 Cup Classic win in 2012 with Fort Larned. He also was third in the Preakness two years ago with Creative Minister and has a slew of graded stakes wins.\n\nWinning the Kentucky Derby brings a whole different type of recognition, along with a sparkling title that will precede Hernandez for the rest of his life. McPeek asserted immediately afterward that the rider can no longer be considered underrated after a \"brilliant\" ride and called the gutsy inside path taken to victory typical for the jockey.\n\n\"He knows what to do there,\" McPeek said. \"I always had a world of confidence in him. Rarely second-guess anything he does.\"\n\nHowever, the victory created a travel issue for Hernandez, who had planned on head to Louisiana on Sunday morning for a jazz festival. It\u00b4s a switch he was more than willing to make after two remarkable days that demonstrated what the right mounts can yield.\n\n\"You know, it\u00b4s horse racing, it\u00b4s not jockey racing,\" said Hernandez, who planned to celebrate with his wife on Saturday night. \"Just about any jockey out there, if they have the right horse, they can get them to the winner\u00b4s circle. You just you have to be willing to put in the time and the effort to find the right horses.\"\n\nThis story has been corrected to show Hernandez had one Breeders' Cup victory, not two.\n\nAP Kentucky Derby coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/kentucky-derby\n\nBrian Hernandez Jr. rides Mystik Dan across the finish line to win the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race at Churchill Downs Saturday, May 4, 2024, in Louisville, Ky.

We might have taken out a little bit of the inside fence, but that's OK.\"\n\nThe dizzying crescendo at the finish caught everyone wondering how all this would be sorted, including and especially the winner.\n\n\"Right at the wire, they surged late and I was like, 'Oh, God, did we win the Kentucky Derby? (or not),\" said Hernandez, who asked the outrider who accompanied he and horse right after the race. \"That's a long two minutes. Yes, that was the longest two minutes in sports. The fastest two minutes and the longest.\"\n\nDid reaching back to 1947 fail to satisfy the way-back machine?\n\nWell, McPeek became the first trainer to win Friday's filly showcase Kentucky Oaks and the Derby the same weekend since fabled trainer Ben Jones with Real Delight and Hill Gail in 1952.\n\n\"Wow,\" said McPeek, to ask for his reaction to the dusty nugget. \"You know, wow.\"\n\nIt was more than simply the duel between Mystik Dan and Sierra Leone. As the runner-up and Forever Young charged and labor to contend, you couldn't slide a racing program between them at the frenzied finish.\n\nMystik Dan had seized the shortest route and built a cushion that initially looked as if it would continue growing into a crowning rather than a contest.\n\nThen, the thawing began.\n\nThe lead melted, first to interesting, then eye catching, finally and undeniably thrilling. The celebration, as uncertain and uncharted as it was, was preparing to begin.\n\n\"I have no idea yet,\" said Hernandez, asked for the plan. \"I've never won the Derby before.\"\n\nHernandez was supposed to take a 6 a.m. flight to New Orleans to attend Jazz Fest. He was quizzed about the probability he would make that flight.\n\nThe permanent postrace grin widened.\n\n\"I think we're going to have to reschedule now,\" he said.\n\nThe combination of Mystik Dan, Hernandez and McPeek left Louisville with $3 million of the record $5 million more. Add an immeasurable slice of history as part of the bounty.\n\nAt the heart of it, this wasn't about missing Southern California trainer Bob Baffert, the momentarily banished face of the sport. It wasn't about the disastrous Derby week of a year ago with dead horses and a deluge of questions. It wasn't about the darkening financial clouds that has pushed horse racing perilous close to the cliff's edge.\n\nIt was about what has made the Kentucky Derby the penultimate measuring stick of a sport that began in 1875, 10 years after the end of the Civil War.\n\nAnd Mystik Dan. The horse paid $39.22, but in the end the whole of it felt priceless.\n\nUnbelievable, Hernandez reminded us.\n\nHistory demands a flourish. Sometimes, like the first Saturday in May, it delivers.

Gasaway, a former wide receiver at the University of Arkansas at Monticello, is part of the 4G Racing ownership team, which includes his cousin Brent Gasaway, Brent's wife Sharilyn Gasaway and Daniel Hamby III.\n\nMystik Dan, who had 18-1 odds coming into the Derby according to NBC Sports, paid $39.22 to win, $16.32 to place and $10 to show. Sierra Leone, the second favorite at 9/2 odds, paid $6.54 and $4.64 with a narrow runner-up finish, and Forever Young, at 7-1, paid $5.58 for third.\n\nBut the result wasn't confirmed until Churchill Downs released an official photo of the finish. Mystik Dan's nose reached the wire first, with Sierra Leone nearly beating him from the outside and Forever Young just an inch or so behind Sierra Leone.\n\n\"We felt perfectly confident we got the win,\" Lance Gasaway told NBC.\n\nMystik Dan jockey Brian Hernandez Jr., who won the Kentucky Oaks aboard Thorpedo Anna on Friday, probably sweated out the few minutes between the finish and final determination more.\n\n\"That was the longest few minutes I've ever felt in my life, waiting for the name and number above us,\" Hernandez told NBC. \"It was exciting when we hit the wire, but I wasn't sure if we won. It was a rush to sit here and wait for it.\"\n\nThe win came on a pair of significant anniversaries. Saturday's Kentucky Derby was the 150th running and also the first anniversary of the passing of Gasaway's father, Clint, who was 85.\n\n\"This is for him,\" Gasaway said, hoisting the winner's trophy. \"He's smiling down at us.\"\n\nMystik Dan, the winner of the Southwest Stakes at Oaklawn Park earlier this year, was the 17th qualifier for the Derby based on a points system Churchill Downs uses, but drew the No. 3 post, close to the inside. He stayed near the front of the pack, close to the rail, for most of the oval, but charged out to about a 2 \u00bd-length lead before Sierra Leone and Forever Young made their moves and narrowed the gap.\n\nThe next Triple Crown race is the Preakness Stakes in Baltimore on May 18, but Gasaway didn't exactly commit to the challenge.

GRAVES Associated Press\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The second jewel of horse racing's Triple Crown could be missing 150th Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and other co-stars, quashing hopes for a rematch after the thrilling three-wide photo finish in the milestone race.\n\nTrainer Kenny McPeek and the horse's ownership wouldn't commit to whether the colt would race in the 149th Preakness on May 18 in Baltimore, which requires a quick two-week turnaround. Mystik Dan will travel to Saratoga, New York, before they decide whether to enter him in the 1 3/16 mile Preakness.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek said Sunday morning outside his barn on Churchill Downs' back side. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. ... So, we'll just watch him over the next week. It'll be one of those (situations) where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Iowa homeowners age 65 and up are eligible for state tax exemption\n\nThe picturesque track in upstate New York will host the Triple Crown's final jewel for the next three years while Belmont Park is being reconstructed. The Belmont has also been shortened to a 1 1/4 mile, matching the Derby distance that Mystik Dan won by a nose over Sierra Leone and Japan-bred Forever Young in the closest three-way finish since 1947.\n\nThe five-week gap follows a more normal race schedule for many thoroughbreds and some trainers might opt to head to Saratoga to acclimate horses sooner.\n\nChad Brown said Sierra Leone will skip the Preakness and leave on Monday to train at Saratoga and run the Belmont. Considering how much it took for Sierra Leone to navigate other horses and chase down Mystik Dan before falling a nose short at the wire, rest sounds necessary.\n\n\"He's a real laid back horse but when we brought him out, was a little more tired than he normally is after his races,\" Brown said. \"I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nLouisville-born trainer Brad Cox is watching Catching Freedom (fourth) and Just A Touch (20th) before deciding their next steps. Forever Young and fellow Japan-bred T O Password (fifth) are headed home on Tuesday.\n\nThat could leave the Preakness without some Derby star power at first glance, though it won't lack for plotlines with a number of well-rested horses expected to compete at Pimlico Race Course.\n\nHall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert could have two entrants as he seeks to follow up National Treasure's victory there last spring. He trains Santa Anita Derby runner-up Imagination and Arkansas Derby winner Muth, who missed the Derby after failed legal attempts by owner Amr Zedan to get him in despite Baffert's suspension by Churchill Downs through the end of 2024.\n\nAs McPeek and the owners ponder a decision, he and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. basked in a wash of congratulations for a Derby victory that put them in exclusive company.\n\nSaturday's win helped both claim rare weekend sweeps of the Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies. McPeek is just the third trainer to do that and first since Ben Jones (who did it twice) in 1952, while Hernandez is the eighth rider to achieve the feat and first since fellow Louisiana native and Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Mystik Dan just stood calm and unfazed as a cluster of onlookers took photos and selfies as workers bathed him outside the barn. He was then draped with the winner's blanket signifying his Derby win before being led back to his stall with a WWE-style title belt laying on an outer wall. Oaks-winning filly Thorpedo Anna also made a brief appearance and soaked in the attention.\n\nHernandez is preparing for his own life-changing spotlight and title after claiming the sport's marquee race. He dined with his family after the Derby but didn't sleep much, a routine that figures to go on for the next few days amid a flood of interview requests. At some point he hopes to get his mind around all that has happened, but he already has a response ready.\n\n\"When somebody asks what my profession is, I'm able to tell them I'm a professional jockey.

I came through a really tight spot, we actually kind of climbed up on top of the rail a little bit,\" said Hernandez of his dangerous manoeuvre.\n\n\"When he shot through that spot he was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it. He shot off and I thought, 'Oh man, we have a chance to win the Kentucky Derby.'\"\n\nIt was an unforgettable weekend for trainer Kenneth McPeek and Hernandez who on Friday had teamed to win the Kentucky Oaks for fillies with Thorpedo Anna.\n\nMcPeek became only the fourth trainer to land the prestigious double in the same year after Ben Jones in 1952.\n\nMcPeek also hailed Hernandez saying he was \"probably one of the most under-rated riders in racing.\"\n\n\"But not anymore - right!\" McPeek exalted.\n\nopyright \u00a9 2022 Khaleej Times.

GRAVES Associated Press\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The second jewel of horse racing's Triple Crown could be missing 150th Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and other co-stars, quashing hopes for a rematch after the thrilling three-wide photo finish in the milestone race.\n\nTrainer Kenny McPeek and the horse's ownership wouldn't commit to whether the colt would race in the 149th Preakness on May 18 in Baltimore, which requires a quick two-week turnaround. Mystik Dan will travel to Saratoga, New York, before they decide whether to enter him in the 1 3/16 mile Preakness.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek said Sunday morning outside his barn on Churchill Downs' back side. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. ... So, we'll just watch him over the next week. It'll be one of those (situations) where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The Belmont has also been shortened to a 1 1/4 mile, matching the Derby distance that Mystik Dan won by a nose over Sierra Leone and Japan-bred Forever Young in the closest three-way finish since 1947.\n\nThe five-week gap follows a more normal race schedule for many thoroughbreds and some trainers might opt to head to Saratoga to acclimate horses sooner.\n\nChad Brown said Sierra Leone will skip the Preakness and leave on Monday to train at Saratoga and run the Belmont. Considering how much it took for Sierra Leone to navigate other horses and chase down Mystik Dan before falling a nose short at the wire, rest sounds necessary.\n\n\"He's a real laid back horse but when we brought him out, was a little more tired than he normally is after his races,\" Brown said. \"I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nLouisville-born trainer Brad Cox is watching Catching Freedom (fourth) and Just A Touch (20th) before deciding their next steps. Forever Young and fellow Japan-bred T O Password (fifth) are headed home on Tuesday.\n\nThat could leave the Preakness without some Derby star power at first glance, though it won't lack for plotlines with a number of well-rested horses expected to compete at Pimlico Race Course.\n\nHall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert could have two entrants as he seeks to follow up National Treasure's victory there last spring. He trains Santa Anita Derby runner-up Imagination and Arkansas Derby winner Muth, who missed the Derby after failed legal attempts by owner Amr Zedan to get him in despite Baffert's suspension by Churchill Downs through the end of 2024.\n\nAs McPeek and the owners ponder a decision, he and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. basked in a wash of congratulations for a Derby victory that put them in exclusive company.\n\nSaturday's win helped both claim rare weekend sweeps of the Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies. McPeek is just the third trainer to do that and first since Ben Jones (who did it twice) in 1952, while Hernandez is the eighth rider to achieve the feat and first since fellow Louisiana native and Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Mystik Dan just stood calm and unfazed as a cluster of onlookers took photos and selfies as workers bathed him outside the barn. He was then draped with the winner's blanket signifying his Derby win before being led back to his stall with a WWE-style title belt laying on an outer wall. Oaks-winning filly Thorpedo Anna also made a brief appearance and soaked in the attention.\n\nHernandez is preparing for his own life-changing spotlight and title after claiming the sport's marquee race. He dined with his family after the Derby but didn't sleep much, a routine that figures to go on for the next few days amid a flood of interview requests. At some point he hopes to get his mind around all that has happened, but he already has a response ready.\n\n\"When somebody asks what my profession is, I'm able to tell them I'm a professional jockey. And then the first question they normally ask is, 'Have you ever won the Kentucky Derby?' I can say that now.\"\n\nClose\n\nA race fan sits in the stands Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated

McPeek had previously trained filly Swiss Skydiver, the 2020 Preakness Stakes champion, and Sarava, long-shot winner of the 2002 Belmont Stakes.\n\nThe Derby win capped a remarkable 24 hours for McPeek and Hernandez, who teamed up with Thorpedo Anna to win the Kentucky Oaks on Friday.\n\nMcPeek effusively praised Hernandez and his ride.\n\nThe 3-1 favorite, Fierceness, came in 15th in the 20-horse field.\n\nHernandez, the son of a jockey and sibling of two other riders, recalled riding his bike as a 6-year-old, telling anyone who'd listen that someday he'd be a Kentucky Derby-winning jockey.\n\n\"This is a lifetime achievement,\" Hernandez said. \"This goes to our whole family.\"\n\nMystik Dan might have benefited from Sierra Leone and Forever Young bumping several times down the stretch as they desperately tried to down the leader and eventual winner.\n\n\"Oftentimes it's a game of inches,\" said Chad Brown, Sierra Leone's trainer.\n\nBrown said he was pleased with his horse's run Saturday, despite coming up a nose short.\n\n\"I'm so proud of his effort today. The horse did everything we asked him to do,\" Brown said. \"It just came up just a little bit short.\"\n\nMystik Dan's Triple Crown quest will continue on May 18 with the 149th running of the Preakness Stakes in Baltimore.\n\nBefore Saturday's 12th race at Churchill Downs unfolded, celebrities and big hats filled the clubhouse, grandstands and paddock under Louisville's famed twin spires.\n\nWynonna Judd performed the national anthem, leading a stable of boldface names from the entertainment world such as Sheryl Lee Ralph, Chris Tucker, Kid Rock, Jack Harlow, Jimmy Fallon, Travis Tritt, Josh Groban, Holly Robinson Peete and Richie Sambora.\n\nLifestyle maven Martha Stewart and football figures such as dateless Travis Kelce, Aaron Rodgers, Jameis Winston, Isiah Pacheco and Emmitt Smith were also in attendance.\n\nStewart gave the \"riders up\" call for jockeys to take their mounts.\n\nThe Derby day also included a host of other big-money races.\n\nLong shot Trikari rallied to a thrilling upset victory in the American Turf Stakes. The 47-1 dark horse roared past favorite Formidable Man in the final strides of the $600,000 race.\n\nGun Pilot pulled away to victory at the $1 million Churchill Downs Stakes, adding to the long winning resume of trainer Steve Asmussen.\n\nProgram Trading edged Naval Power to dramatically win the $1 million Turf Classic Stakes.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

His best finish was second with Tejano Run all the way back in 1995.\n\nIt was a heartbreaking loss for the connections of Sierra Leone, who had won the Toyota Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland on April 6.

What to know about Mystik Dan's Kentucky Derby-winning jockey", "body": "Led by his humble steed -- and a smart bit of strategy -- Brian Hernandez etched his name in Kentucky Derby history Saturday night.\n\nThe Louisiana native took his place among the stars in eye-catching fashion, leading Mystik Dan to glory with a photo finish at the 2024 iteration of the Run for the Races. It couldn't have been any closer -- Mystik Dan just outpaced Sierra Leone and Forever Young to capture the gold.\n\n\"This is unbelievable,\" Hernandez said. \"That was the longest few minutes I've ever felt in my life, waiting for them to hang that number up. ... It's hard to put into words.\"\n\nIn the process, Hernandez added to his family's rich legacy in the world of horse racing. To reach a career summit after 20 years as a jockey is one thing. To do so when riding swirls in your blood is an entirely different proposition.\n\nWith that, here's what you need to know about Hernandez, one of just eight jockeys to capture both the Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby in the same year.\n\nMORE: How much prize money does the Kentucky Derby winner get in 2024?\n\nHernandez spearheaded Mystik Dan's ascent to the upper echelons of racing lore, pushing his thoroughbred out in front with frantic instructions. Hernandez's impressive tactical acumen, coupled with his charger's natural athleticism, that brought trainer Kenny McPeek and owners Lance Gasaway, Daniel Hamby and 4G Racing to victory lane.\n\nHe isn't entirely new to making history. Hernandez led stallion Fort Larned to victory in the 2012 Breeders' Cup Classic. He also has an Eclipse Award for Outstanding Apprentice Jockey in his treasure chest. That chest got a whole lot glitzier Saturday, however, when he raced out in front and held off menacing runs by Sierra Leone and Forever Young to take his place in the history books.\n\n\"Around the far turn, my horse was so game being up on the inside,\" Hernandez said after the race. \"I came through a really tight spot and we kind of climbed up on top of the rail a bit. When he shot through that spot and was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it, he shot off. I was like, 'Oh man, we have a shot to win the Kentucky Derby.'\"\n\nHernandez isn't the first member of his family to find joy atop the back of a thoroughbred. That status belongs to his father, Brian Sr., who enjoyed a lengthy if unspectacular career as a rider in the southern Louisiana horse-racing circuit.\n\nAnd he's not the only family member to follow in his father's footsteps. His brother, Colby and sister, Courtney, also gravitated to the the stables, earning $58.1 million and $1.2 million in career earnings, respectively.\n\n\"This is a lifetime achievement, this goes to our whole family,\" Hernandez said. \"To be able to live that dream that I had when I was a 6-year-old kid, riding my bike around my grandparents farm and telling them I was going to win the Kentucky Derby one day, well, here we are.\"\n\nThe win for Mystik Dan at the Kentucky Derby cemented the first Kentucky Oaks-Kentucky Derby double by a jockey since 2009.

Sierra Leone, the race's most expensive horse, was valued at $2.3 million.\n\nThe result was so close that officials took several minutes to confirm Mystik Dan's win.\n\n\"The longest few minutes of my life,\" is how Brian Hernandez Jr., Mystik Dan's jockey, described the wait for the result.\n\nThe winner claimed the largest share of the $5 million purse, amounting to $3.1 million. The race drew a crowd of 156,710 at Churchill Downs, the largest since 2018.\n\nAlso Read: Virtual Horse Racing Game Photo Finish Announces New Funding - Meet The Investors And Next Steps\n\nThis victory marks a significant milestone for Hernandez and trainer Kenny McPeek, who also achieved success in the Kentucky Oaks for fillies on Friday with Thorpedo Anna.\n\nFierceness, a 3-1 favorite, finished in 15th place.\n\nWhy It Matters: The Kentucky Derby has a history of surprising outcomes. NBC Connecticut reported Rich Strike's victory in 2022, the second-biggest upset in derby history.\n\nStrike overcame 80-1 odds to beat the field at Churchill Downs.\n\nThe race also has a notorious jinx associated with the No. 17 post position, which has never produced a winner in 149 previous derbies.\n\nMoreover, the derby has faced controversies in recent years. In 2022, trainer Bob Baffert sued Churchill Downs over a two-year ban following the disqualification of his horse, Medina Spirit, for failing a drug test after winning the 2021 derby.\n\nThe 2023 derby also saw the death of several horses at Churchill Downs, casting a shadow over Mage's victory.\n\nNow Read: EXCLUSIVE -- Kentucky Derby Fans Can Score $100K Prize With Web3-Powered SuperFecta Scratch-Off\n\nThis content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Oaks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Oaks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Strike", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rich Strike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mage_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mage (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina_Spirit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medina Spirit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Baffert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob Baffert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Barrel_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Barrel Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEB5S0BB_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539947", "eventUri": "eng-9539947", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

GRAVES Associated Press\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The second jewel of horse racing's Triple Crown could be missing 150th Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and other co-stars, quashing hopes for a rematch after the thrilling three-wide photo finish in the milestone race.\n\nTrainer Kenny McPeek and the horse's ownership wouldn't commit to whether the colt would race in the 149th Preakness on May 18 in Baltimore, which requires a quick two-week turnaround. Mystik Dan will travel to Saratoga, New York, before they decide whether to enter him in the 1 3/16 mile Preakness.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek said Sunday morning outside his barn on Churchill Downs' back side. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. ... So, we'll just watch him over the next week. It'll be one of those (situations) where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The Belmont has also been shortened to a 1 1/4 mile, matching the Derby distance that Mystik Dan won by a nose over Sierra Leone and Japan-bred Forever Young in the closest three-way finish since 1947.\n\nThe five-week gap follows a more normal race schedule for many thoroughbreds and some trainers might opt to head to Saratoga to acclimate horses sooner.\n\nChad Brown said Sierra Leone will skip the Preakness and leave on Monday to train at Saratoga and run the Belmont. Considering how much it took for Sierra Leone to navigate other horses and chase down Mystik Dan before falling a nose short at the wire, rest sounds necessary.\n\n\"He's a real laid back horse but when we brought him out, was a little more tired than he normally is after his races,\" Brown said. \"I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nLouisville-born trainer Brad Cox is watching Catching Freedom (fourth) and Just A Touch (20th) before deciding their next steps. Forever Young and fellow Japan-bred T O Password (fifth) are headed home on Tuesday.\n\nThat could leave the Preakness without some Derby star power at first glance, though it won't lack for plotlines with a number of well-rested horses expected to compete at Pimlico Race Course.\n\nHall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert could have two entrants as he seeks to follow up National Treasure's victory there last spring. He trains Santa Anita Derby runner-up Imagination and Arkansas Derby winner Muth, who missed the Derby after failed legal attempts by owner Amr Zedan to get him in despite Baffert's suspension by Churchill Downs through the end of 2024.\n\nAs McPeek and the owners ponder a decision, he and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. basked in a wash of congratulations for a Derby victory that put them in exclusive company.\n\nSaturday's win helped both claim rare weekend sweeps of the Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies. McPeek is just the third trainer to do that and first since Ben Jones (who did it twice) in 1952, while Hernandez is the eighth rider to achieve the feat and first since fellow Louisiana native and Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Mystik Dan just stood calm and unfazed as a cluster of onlookers took photos and selfies as workers bathed him outside the barn. He was then draped with the winner's blanket signifying his Derby win before being led back to his stall with a WWE-style title belt laying on an outer wall. Oaks-winning filly Thorpedo Anna also made a brief appearance and soaked in the attention.\n\nHernandez is preparing for his own life-changing spotlight and title after claiming the sport's marquee race. He dined with his family after the Derby but didn't sleep much, a routine that figures to go on for the next few days amid a flood of interview requests. At some point he hopes to get his mind around all that has happened, but he already has a response ready.\n\n\"When somebody asks what my profession is, I'm able to tell them I'm a professional jockey. And then the first question they normally ask is, 'Have you ever won the Kentucky Derby?' I can say that now.\"\n\nClose\n\nRace fans watch a race Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nA race fan walks through the grounds Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race.\n\nCharlie Riedel, Associated Press\n\nA race fan sits in the stands Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nA race fan walks through the stands Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nRace fans watch the paddock Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nHorses compete during a race Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nA race fan waits in the infield Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nAbbie Parr, Associated Press Scenes from the 150th derby day\n\nRace fans watch a race Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nA race fan walks through the grounds Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race.\n\nCharlie Riedel, Associated Press\n\nA race fan sits in the stands Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nA race fan walks through the stands Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nRace fans watch the paddock Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nHorses compete during a race Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nA race fan waits in the infield Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nAbbie Parr, Associated Press 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!

(AP) -- The 150th Kentucky Derby produced one of the most dramatic finishes in its storied history -- three noses at the wire.\n\nMystik Dan desperately fought to hang on with two challengers coming to him in the closing strides. He did, too, after a delay of several minutes while the closest three-horse photo finish since 1947 was sorted out.\n\nThat year, Jet Pilot won by a head over Phalanx, who was another head in front of Faultless.\n\nThis one was much tighter.\n\nMystik Dan, an 18-1 shot, edged Sierra Leone by a nose, with Forever Young another nose back in third on Saturday. Sierra Leone was the most expensive horse in the race at $2.3 million.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He quickly opened up a daylight advantage on the field.\n\n\"When he shot through that spot, he was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it,\" Hernandez said. \"He shot off and I'm like, 'Oh man, I've got a big chance to win the Kentucky Derby.'\"\n\nTo Mystik Dan's outside, Sierra Leone and Forever Young took up the chase in the middle of the track.\n\nAs Mystik Dan sped along the rail, Sierra Leone lugged in and bumped Forever Young three times in the stretch, but jockey Ryusei Sakai didn't claim foul.\n\nMystik Dan got so close to the rail that Hernandez's boot struck it.\n\n\"But I think we can buy another pair of boots,\" he said.\n\nThe winner's share of the record $5 million purse was $3.1 million, with the jockey and trainer typically earning 10% each.\n\n\"Just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey and ride,\" McPeek said. \"Brian is one of the most underrated jockeys, but not anymore, right?\"\n\nSierra Leone, the second choice at 9-2 odds, and Forever Young from Japan came up just short at the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs, the largest crowd since 2018.\n\n\"You get beat a nose in the Kentucky Derby, it's a tough one,\" said Chad Brown, trainer of Sierra Leone. \"But I'm so proud of the horse.\"\n\nIt was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- the closest margin in horse racing -- and the first since Grindstone edged Cavonnier to wear the garland of red roses in 1996.\n\nThe crowd waited several minutes in the heat and humidity as the result was reviewed by the stewards and declared official.\n\n\"The longest few minutes of my life,\" Hernandez said, after he and Mystik Dan walked in circles while the stunning result was settled. \"To see your number flash up to win the Derby, I don't think it will sink in for a while.\"\n\nFierceness finished 15th in the field of 20 3-year-olds. Owner Mike Repole is 0 for 8 in the derby. He had the favorite in 2011 with Uncle Mo, who was scratched the day before the race with an illness. Last year, Forte was scratched the morning of the race as the favorite with a bruised foot.\n\nMystik Dan ran 1 1/4 miles over a fast track in 2:03.34 and paid $39.22, $16.32 and $10.\n\nHernandez and trainer Kenny McPeek had teamed for a wire-to-wire win in the Kentucky Oaks for fillies on Friday with Thorpedo Anna. McPeek is the first trainer to sweep both races since Ben Jones in 1952.\n\nMcPeek's only other victory in a Triple Crown race was also a shocker: 70-1 Sarava won the 2002 Belmont Stakes -- the biggest upset in that race's history. The colt spoiled the Triple Crown bid of War Emblem.\n\nThe winning owners are cousins Lance and Brent Gasaway and Daniel Hamby III, all from Arkansas. They bred Mystik Dan.\n\n\"We've done it with what I call working-class horse,\" McPeek said, explaining the colt's sire and dam weren't big names.\n\nSharilyn Gasaway, Brent's wife, said, \"It is surreal for sure. We feel like we're just ordinary people and we've got an amazing horse.\"\n\nSierra Leone returned $6.54 and $4.64. Forever Young was another nose back in third and paid $5.58 to show.\n\nCatching Freedom was fourth, followed by T O Password of Japan, Resilience, Stronghold, Honor Marie and Endlessly. Dornoch was 10th and then came Track Phantom, West Saratoga, Domestic Product, Epic Ride, Fierceness, Society Man, Just Steel, Grand Mo the First, Catalytic and Just a Touch.\n\nAP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

I came through a really tight spot, we actually kind of climbed up on top of the rail a little bit,\" said Hernandez of his dangerous manoeuvre.\n\n\"When he shot through that spot he was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it. He shot off and I thought, 'Oh man, we have a chance to win the Kentucky Derby.'\"\n\nIt was an unforgettable weekend for trainer Kenneth McPeek and Hernandez who on Friday had teamed to win the Kentucky Oaks for fillies with Thorpedo Anna.\n\nMcPeek became only the fourth trainer to land the prestigious double in the same year after Ben Jones in 1952.\n\nMcPeek also hailed Hernandez saying he was \"probably one of the most under-rated riders in racing.\"", "source": {"uri": "khaleejtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khaleej times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "leslie_wilson_jr@khaleejtimes.com", "name": "Leslie Wilson Jr.", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAE_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UAE Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furlong", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Furlong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Gaffalione", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Gaffalione"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eclipse (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_A._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben A.

Except it's not just the moves, the decisions and the non-decisions made in those two minutes that matter; it's a lifetime of split-decision choices that combine to create a life and, in one case on a muggy Saturday evening, make history.\n\nTo unspool the story of Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan's historic run along the rail and into the record books requires far more than a rewind around the Churchill Downs track. It includes a decision to not bail on a dinner date 30-plus years ago and a hunt for bloodstock information in the basement of a college library years before even that. It necessitates a commitment to a would-have-been retired mare and a father convincing his son to fall in love with horse racing. It requires one jockey to study another rail-riding rider, and a partnership between a collection of people who compete with the big names but intentionally never cared about being one of them.\n\nOn the historic 150th running of this race, Mystik Dan delivered a breath-holding finish, beating second-place Sierra Leone and third-place Forever Young in the first three-horse photo finish since 1947. So close was the finish, not even winning jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. was certain what happened, asking an outrider as he eased Mystik Dan if he'd won the Kentucky Derby.\n\nIt took an agonizing five minutes for the answer to arrive, the 156,710 spectators on hand going from euphoric as the three horses neared the wire to near-stunned silence as they, like the jockey, awaited the decision.\n\nFinally, Mystik Dan's name flashed on the big board, the crowd in the stands whooping in joy, the outrider sharing the news with Hernandez. \"It took about two minutes, and then finally when they said, 'Yeah, you've just won the Kentucky Derby, I was like, 'Oh wow, that's a long two minutes. That was the longest two minutes in sports -- from the fastest two minutes to the longest by far.''\n\nPerhaps the only person not surprised was trainer Ken McPeek. The Kentucky-based trainer practically made like Babe Ruth and called his shot all week. On Friday, when he sat at a press conference to celebrate his Kentucky Oaks winner Thorpedo Anna, it was suggested that perhaps he'd return for another winning presser the next day. \"Count on it,'' he said. When the promise was delivered, McPeek celebrated on the track, holding his daughter Annie's hand tight.\n\nBy combining the winning ride with that of Thorpedo Anna, McPeek became the first trainer since Ben Jones in 1952 to win the Kentucky Oaks-Kentucky Derby double, and Hernandez the first jockey to do so since Calvin Borel in 2009.\n\nIt is fitting that Hernandez matched Borel. In the longer view of this race, the one that makes more like \"It's A Wonderful Life\" and considers how even the most inconsequential of decisions lead to an epic life, it was Borel that Hernandez cued up on the videos to study. Borel was known around the track as Calvin Bo-Rail for his love and comfort with riding along the rail, a spot plenty of jockeys would prefer to avoid. When Mystik Dan drew post position three, Hernandez and McPeek started talking about how they might be able to turn what plenty envisioned as a disadvantage into an advantage. Hernandez discovered the secret sauce in the recaps of Borel's rides.\n\nIn the immediate here and now, in the 2:03.34 it took Mystik Dan to cover the 1 \u00bc miles, the race was won because Hernanedez Jr. steered the horse on a brilliant ride. He followed Track Phantom along the rail, and when the lead horse gave him a half-step's worth of room, he squeezed Mystik Dan through the narrow space that opened like the sliver of light beneath a doorframe, holding on to the finish line to win by a nose. Favorite Fierceness finished 15th.\n\nBut this race was won long before Hernandez cued up the video. It was won some 40 years ago when a young McPeek buried himself in the University of Kentucky agriculture library to educate himself on BloodHorse and thoroughbred records. Taken to Keeneland by his grandfather, McPeek never saw himself doing much else other than horse racing. He jokes that his ag library basement studies might have resulted in better grades than his normal coursework, but it's only because it fed a passion.\n\nAll that studying and poking around, though, created a sort of horse-racing Everyman. He prefers to touch every bit of horse racing and is respected as much as a bloodstock agent as a trainer. He even created an app -- Horses Now -- for replays. He's a big believer in the industry, well-liked and well-respected among his peers for his loyalty and decency and his willingness to keep things simple. Horse racing is a big business, and an expensive one, the animals often owned by conglomerates over individuals. McPeek has purposefully tried to eschew that approach. \"I think what I'm most proud of is, we didn't do with Calumet Farm horses,'' he said, citing the big-breeding conglomerate in Lexington. \"We did it with working-class horses.''\n\nMcPeek trained Mystik Dan's mare, Ma'am, and when she neared retirement, he convinced Lance, Brent and Sharilyn Gasaway not to retire her but to breed her with Goldencents, a 2013 Derby entrant. That they agreed goes to the trust the owners put in McPeek, but also back to their own horse-racing roots and their little moments that led them to a small-ish racehorse with the biggest of wins.\n\nLance Gasaway, you might argue, is the Mystik Dan of college football. That is to say, perhaps a tad overlooked. A record holder and Hall of Famer, he starred not at Arkansas but at Arkansas-Monticello, where he was an NAIA All-American for the Boll Weevils. He got into horse racing at the urging of his dad, Clint, the two partnering at Oaklawn, their home track. Their biggest and best shot at the limelight came with Wells Bayou, who won the Louisiana Derby and was targeted for the Kentucky Derby until COVID struck and moved the race to September.\n\nClint died about a year ago, and as Lance sat on the dais, he got more than a little choked up when he recalled his father's influence. \"To me, this is for him,'' he said. \"Dad would have loved it. He loved the game.'' But a few years ago, back when Ma'am was about to be retired, Clint decided he was getting too old to get into breeding horses. Lance opted to bring in his first cousin, Brent.\n\nThirty-five years ago, Brent was meant to meet his now-wife Sharilyn for a date, but he was late. And then later. Turns out he was at the track, still at the races. Sharilyn was less than thrilled -- at least until Brent that night popped the question. When Sharilyn quit her full-time job, the couple opted to get into horse racing full-time, about the same time that Clint and Lance got into the game. When Lance needed a new partner for breeding and, eventually, in the ownership of Mystik Dan, Sharilyn and Brent made perfect sense.\n\nSitting side-by-side, sandwiched between McPeek and Hernandez, Lance and Sharilyn both seemed a bit wide-eyed and happily dazed. Asked how they might celebrate, Lance deadpanned, \"I don't know. I never won the Derby before.''\n\nNeither had McPeek. But now, with his own Triple Crown -- he won the Preakness in 2020 with Swiss Skydiver and the Belmont in 2002 with Sarqva -- he at least had an inkling. \"I'm going to go back to the barn and hug all the staff and all the family,'' he said. \"And then my house is wide open if anyone wants to come over.''\n\nMystik Dan may have won the Derby in two minutes of maneuvering, but it took a million smaller moments to create the masterpiece.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dana_o_neil@theathletic.com", "name": "Dana O'Neil", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Borel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Borel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_A._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben A.

Mystik Dan will travel to Saratoga, New York, before they decide whether to enter him in the 1 3/16 mile Preakness.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek said Sunday morning outside his barn on Churchill Downs' back side. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. ... So, we'll just watch him over the next week. It'll be one of those (situations) where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nThe picturesque track in upstate New York will host the Triple Crown's final jewel for the next three years while Belmont Park is being reconstructed. The Belmont has also been shortened to a 1 1/4 mile, matching the Derby distance that Mystik Dan won by a nose over Sierra Leone and Japan-bred Forever Young in the closest three-way finish since 1947.\n\nThe five-week gap follows a more normal race schedule for many thoroughbreds and some trainers might opt to head to Saratoga to acclimate horses sooner.\n\nChad Brown said Sierra Leone will skip the Preakness and leave on Monday to train at Saratoga and run the Belmont. Considering how much it took for Sierra Leone to navigate other horses and chase down Mystik Dan before falling a nose short at the wire, rest sounds necessary.\n\n\"He's a real laid back horse but when we brought him out, was a little more tired than he normally is after his races,\" Brown said. \"I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nLouisville-born trainer Brad Cox is watching Catching Freedom (fourth) and Just A Touch (20th) before deciding their next steps. Forever Young and fellow Japan-bred T O Password (fifth) are headed home on Tuesday.\n\nThat could leave the Preakness without some Derby star power at first glance, though it won't lack for plotlines with a number of well-rested horses expected to compete at Pimlico Race Course.\n\nHall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert could have two entrants as he seeks to follow up National Treasure's victory there last spring. He trains Santa Anita Derby runner-up Imagination and Arkansas Derby winner Muth, who missed the Derby after failed legal attempts by owner Amr Zedan to get him in despite Baffert's suspension by Churchill Downs through the end of 2024.\n\nAs McPeek and the owners ponder a decision, he and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. basked in a wash of congratulations for a Derby victory that put them in exclusive company.\n\nSaturday's win helped both claim rare weekend sweeps of the Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies. McPeek is just the third trainer to do that and first since Ben Jones (who did it twice) in 1952, while Hernandez is the eighth rider to achieve the feat and first since fellow Louisiana native and Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Mystik Dan just stood calm and unfazed as a cluster of onlookers took photos and selfies as workers bathed him outside the barn. He was then draped with the winner's blanket signifying his Derby win before being led back to his stall with a WWE-style title belt laying on an outer wall. Oaks-winning filly Thorpedo Anna also made a brief appearance and soaked in the attention.\n\nHernandez is preparing for his own life-changing spotlight and title after claiming the sport's marquee race. He dined with his family after the Derby but didn't sleep much, a routine that figures to go on for the next few days amid a flood of interview requests. At some point he hopes to get his mind around all that has happened, but he already has a response ready.\n\n\"When somebody asks what my profession is, I'm able to tell them I'm a professional jockey. And then the first question they normally ask is, 'Have you ever won the Kentucky Derby?' I can say that now.\"", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Springs,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_H._Cox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad H.

(AP) -- Brian Hernandez Jr. will need a minute to digest his signature victory in the 150th Kentucky Derby.\n\nMaybe even more time since the milestone derby capped the best weekend of a jockey career spent mostly under the radar.\n\nThe Louisiana native rode Mystik Dan to an epic win Saturday at Churchill Downs, sliding past favorite Fierceness along the rail at the final turn and holding off Sierra Leone and Forever Young by a nose in an epic three-horse photo finish. Hernandez wasn't even sure he had won until seeing the replay and keeping his eyes glued to the flat screen that showed the continuous loop.\n\n\"I'm like, woo, I think we just won the Kentucky Derby,\" the 38-year-old said. \"But then those horses, they were so far out there, you couldn't really see them. And then they surged so quickly.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh man, I hope we won. I hope we won.' And then when they hung up our number, it was just instant relief.\"\n\nHernandez's derby victory aboard Mystik Dan at 18-1 odds came a day after he rode filly Thorpedo Anna to a wire-to-wire rout by 4 3/4 lengths in the 150th Kentucky Oaks. That made him the first jockey to complete the Derby/Oaks double since Hall of Famer Calvin Borel achieved the feat aboard Mine That Bird and filly Rachel Alexandra, respectively, in 2009. Kenny McPeek became the first trainer to earn the double since Ben Jones in 1952.\n\n\"We came into the weekend thinking we had really good chances both Friday and Saturday,\" Hernandez added. \"To have the horses pull it off for us, we really have to thank all the guys back in the barn.\n\n\"I don't know how long it's going to take to sink in. It's definitely a surreal moment.\"\n\nHernandez's victory was fitting since he studied Borel's derby wins aboard Mine That Bird and Super Saver (2010), along with being around him during 20 years of racing in Kentucky. Those lessons paid off as he broke through after four derby finishes ranging from eighth to 12th, including 11th last May on Sun Thunder.\n\nHis seminal moment shouldn't have been shocking considering Hernandez already had an Eclipse Award to his name as top apprentice rider in 2004 along with a Breeders' Cup Classic win in 2012 with Fort Larned. He also was third in the Preakness two years ago with Creative Minister and has a slew of graded stakes wins.\n\nWinning the Kentucky Derby brings a whole different type of recognition, along with a sparkling title that will precede Hernandez for the rest of his life. McPeek asserted immediately afterward that the rider can no longer be considered underrated after a \"brilliant\" ride and called the gutsy inside path taken to victory typical for the jockey.\n\n\"He knows what to do there,\" McPeek said. \"I always had a world of confidence in him. Rarely second-guess anything he does.\"\n\nHowever, the victory created a travel issue for Hernandez, who had planned on head to Louisiana on Sunday morning for a jazz festival. It's a switch he was more than willing to make after two remarkable days that demonstrated what the right mounts can yield.\n\n\"You know, it's horse racing, it's not jockey racing,\" said Hernandez, who planned to celebrate with his wife on Saturday night. \"Just about any jockey out there, if they have the right horse, they can get them to the winner's circle.

GRAVES Associated Press\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The second jewel of horse racing's Triple Crown could be missing 150th Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and other co-stars, quashing hopes for a rematch after the thrilling three-wide photo finish in the milestone race.\n\nTrainer Kenny McPeek and the horse's ownership wouldn't commit to whether the colt would race in the 149th Preakness on May 18 in Baltimore, which requires a quick two-week turnaround. Mystik Dan will travel to Saratoga, New York, before they decide whether to enter him in the 1 3/16 mile Preakness.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek said Sunday morning outside his barn on Churchill Downs' back side. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. ... So, we'll just watch him over the next week. It'll be one of those (situations) where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The Belmont has also been shortened to a 1 1/4 mile, matching the Derby distance that Mystik Dan won by a nose over Sierra Leone and Japan-bred Forever Young in the closest three-way finish since 1947.\n\nThe five-week gap follows a more normal race schedule for many thoroughbreds and some trainers might opt to head to Saratoga to acclimate horses sooner.\n\nChad Brown said Sierra Leone will skip the Preakness and leave on Monday to train at Saratoga and run the Belmont. Considering how much it took for Sierra Leone to navigate other horses and chase down Mystik Dan before falling a nose short at the wire, rest sounds necessary.\n\n\"He's a real laid back horse but when we brought him out, was a little more tired than he normally is after his races,\" Brown said. \"I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nLouisville-born trainer Brad Cox is watching Catching Freedom (fourth) and Just A Touch (20th) before deciding their next steps. Forever Young and fellow Japan-bred T O Password (fifth) are headed home on Tuesday.\n\nThat could leave the Preakness without some Derby star power at first glance, though it won't lack for plotlines with a number of well-rested horses expected to compete at Pimlico Race Course.\n\nHall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert could have two entrants as he seeks to follow up National Treasure's victory there last spring. He trains Santa Anita Derby runner-up Imagination and Arkansas Derby winner Muth, who missed the Derby after failed legal attempts by owner Amr Zedan to get him in despite Baffert's suspension by Churchill Downs through the end of 2024.\n\nAs McPeek and the owners ponder a decision, he and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. basked in a wash of congratulations for a Derby victory that put them in exclusive company.\n\nSaturday's win helped both claim rare weekend sweeps of the Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies. McPeek is just the third trainer to do that and first since Ben Jones (who did it twice) in 1952, while Hernandez is the eighth rider to achieve the feat and first since fellow Louisiana native and Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Mystik Dan just stood calm and unfazed as a cluster of onlookers took photos and selfies as workers bathed him outside the barn. He was then draped with the winner's blanket signifying his Derby win before being led back to his stall with a WWE-style title belt laying on an outer wall. Oaks-winning filly Thorpedo Anna also made a brief appearance and soaked in the attention.\n\nHernandez is preparing for his own life-changing spotlight and title after claiming the sport's marquee race. He dined with his family after the Derby but didn't sleep much, a routine that figures to go on for the next few days amid a flood of interview requests. At some point he hopes to get his mind around all that has happened, but he already has a response ready.\n\n\"When somebody asks what my profession is, I'm able to tell them I'm a professional jockey. And then the first question they normally ask is, 'Have you ever won the Kentucky Derby?' I can say that now.\"\n\nClose\n\nRace fans watch a race Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nA race fan walks through the grounds Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race.\n\nCharlie Riedel, Associated Press\n\nA race fan walks through the grounds Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race.\n\nCharlie Riedel, Associated Press\n\nRace fans walk through the grounds Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race.\n\nCharlie Riedel, Associated Press\n\nA race fan sits in the stands Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nA race fan walks through the stands Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nA race fan walks through the stands Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nA race fan walks through the grounds Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race.\n\nCharlie Riedel, Associated Press\n\nA race fan bets on horses Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nHorses compete during a race Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nA race fan waits in the infield Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nAbbie Parr, Associated Press Scenes from the 150th derby day\n\nRace fans watch a race Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nA race fan walks through the grounds Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race.\n\nCharlie Riedel, Associated Press\n\nA race fan walks through the grounds Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race.\n\nCharlie Riedel, Associated Press\n\nRace fans walk through the grounds Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race.\n\nCharlie Riedel, Associated Press\n\nA race fan sits in the stands Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nA race fan walks through the stands Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nA race fan walks through the stands Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nA race fan walks through the grounds Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race.\n\nCharlie Riedel, Associated Press\n\nA race fan bets on horses Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nHorses compete during a race Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson, Associated Press\n\nA race fan waits in the infield Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nAbbie Parr, Associated Press 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!

He'd boasted earlier in the week that he wouldn't be surprised if he won both races. He was that confident in both his horses. Mystik Dan defied his post draw in winning.\n\nSince Ferdinand won in 1986 from Gate 1, only Real Quiet in Post 3 had won after breaking from the first three posts. Mystik Dan joined that short list.\n\nSome might say the Derby was won well before the 20-horse field took to the track Saturday at Churchill Downs.\n\nLike McPeek, there were a lot of trainers looking for their first win in the Derby. McPeek finished second the first time he had an entrant in the Derby with Tejano Run in 1995.\n\nEven Bill Mott and Brad Cox, who are Derby winners, were seeking that elation that comes from seeing your horse come in first. Both were awarded Derby wins when the first-place horse was disqualified. Mott won in 2019 with Country House after Maximum Security was disqualified for interference. Cox won with Mandaloun in 2021 after Medina Spirit failed a drug test.\n\nTodd Pletcher and D. Wayne Lukas were the only trainers entering the race who had experienced crossing the finish line first in the Derby.\n\nWith six-time winner Bob Baffert -- who is tied with Ben Jones for the most Kentucky Derby wins -- serving another year suspension at Churchill Downs, it secured an open door for the first-timers to have a chance at it.\n\nIt also helped that Amr Zedan, owner of Muth, opted against transferring his horse from Baffert to another trainer in order to compete in the Derby. Muth had won his last two races including the Grade 1 Arkansas Derby, where he beat Kentucky Derby entrants Just Steel and Mystik Dan.\n\nThe draws also created some luck for the field, as the favorites Fierceness and Sierra Leone were positioned in what, historically, have been difficult posts to win the Derby from.\n\nNo horse had ever won from the 17 post, which Fierceness was initially slated to start. He avoided having to fight history when he moved up to No. 16 after Encino scratched, but it still was not the ideal place for him. Sierra Leone's knack for coming from behind nearly came to fruition despite having to break from the No. 2 post.\n\nAll of those moments created the opening for Mystik Dan to ride right through and secure Kentucky Derby 150 for McPeek.", "source": {"uri": "courier-journal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Courier-Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Oaks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Oaks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ferdinand (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_for_the_Roses_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run for the Roses (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Quiet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Quiet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_I._Mott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William I.

Mystik Dan will travel to Saratoga, New York, before they decide whether to enter him in the 1 3/16 mile Preakness.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek said Sunday morning outside his barn on Churchill Downs' back side. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. ... So, we'll just watch him over the next week. It'll be one of those (situations) where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The Belmont has also been shortened to a 1 1/4 mile, matching the Derby distance that Mystik Dan won by a nose over Sierra Leone and Japan-bred Forever Young in the closest three-way finish since 1947.\n\nThe five-week gap follows a more normal race schedule for many thoroughbreds and some trainers might opt to head to Saratoga to acclimate horses sooner.\n\nChad Brown said Sierra Leone will skip the Preakness and leave on Monday to train at Saratoga and run the Belmont. Considering how much it took for Sierra Leone to navigate other horses and chase down Mystik Dan before falling a nose short at the wire, rest sounds necessary.\n\n\"He's a real laid back horse but when we brought him out, was a little more tired than he normally is after his races,\" Brown said. \"I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nLouisville-born trainer Brad Cox is watching Catching Freedom (fourth) and Just A Touch (20th) before deciding their next steps. Forever Young and fellow Japan-bred T O Password (fifth) are headed home on Tuesday.\n\nThat could leave the Preakness without some Derby star power at first glance, though it won't lack for plotlines with a number of well-rested horses expected to compete at Pimlico Race Course.\n\nHall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert could have two entrants as he seeks to follow up National Treasure's victory there last spring. He trains Santa Anita Derby runner-up Imagination and Arkansas Derby winner Muth, who missed the Derby after failed legal attempts by owner Amr Zedan to get him in despite Baffert's suspension by Churchill Downs through the end of 2024.\n\nAs McPeek and the owners ponder a decision, he and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. basked in a wash of congratulations for a Derby victory that put them in exclusive company.\n\nSaturday's win helped both claim rare weekend sweeps of the Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies. McPeek is just the third trainer to do that and first since Ben Jones (who did it twice) in 1952, while Hernandez is the eighth rider to achieve the feat and first since fellow Louisiana native and Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Mystik Dan just stood calm and unfazed as a cluster of onlookers took photos and selfies as workers bathed him outside the barn. He was then draped with the winner's blanket signifying his Derby win before being led back to his stall with a WWE-style title belt laying on an outer wall. Oaks-winning filly Thorpedo Anna also made a brief appearance and soaked in the attention.\n\nHernandez is preparing for his own life-changing spotlight and title after claiming the sport's marquee race. He dined with his family after the Derby but didn't sleep much, a routine that figures to go on for the next few days amid a flood of interview requests. At some point he hopes to get his mind around all that has happened, but he already has a response ready.\n\n\"When somebody asks what my profession is, I'm able to tell them I'm a professional jockey.

I came through a really tight spot, we actually kind of climbed up on top of the rail a little bit,\" said Hernandez, who said his boot actually brushed the rail.\n\n\"When he shot through that spot he was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it.

Mystik Dan gave Lexington-based trainer Kenny McPeek his first Kentucky Derby victory and gave McPeek the first Derby-Kentucky Oaks double for a trainer since 1952.\n\nWhat happened to everybody else in the field? Here's a look.\n\nThe other horses in the photo finish\n\nWith Mystik Dan leading at the final turn, Blue Grass Stakes winner Sierra Leone, who was 17th at the first turn, and Forever Young, who was in the middle of the pack early, made a late charge from the outside. That charge came just short with a photo finish confirming Mystik Dan had just edged out Sierra Leone.\n\n\"You get beat a nose in the Kentucky Derby, it's a tough one,\" Sierra Leone's trainer, Chad Brown, said. \"But he's a tremendous horse, nearly undefeated. I'm just so lucky to have him, so proud of his effort today.\n\n\"He did what we asked him to do, just came up a little bit short. (I didn't think I won) watching it live, but then when they started showing the slo-mo, I thought maybe this could be a dead heat because I got a great bob. I just wasn't in front.\"\n\nForever Young finished third, just missing becoming the first Japan-bred horse to win the Derby.\n\nCatching Freedom finishes fourth\n\nBrad Cox-trained Catching Freedom took a similar path to Mystik Dan, emerging from the pack along the rail in the final turn but was passed down the stretch by Sierra Leone and Forever Young.\n\n\"Overall I was very happy with Catching Freedom's effort,\" Cox said. \"I really was and the ride Flavien (Prat) gave him. We'll regroup, not sure where we'll land.\"\n\nT O Password, the other Japan-bred horse in the field, was never in contention for the win but made a late charge to finish fifth.\n\n\"He didn't break well,\" jockey Kazushi Kimura said. \"This was his third time running and he was in a new country. He probably wasn't 100% mature. Today he finished up strong. I hope the horse can stay for the Preakness.\"\n\nThe favorite looked in good position early\n\nFlorida Derby winner Fierceness, the 3-1 race favorite, jumped out of the gate but recovered to be among a four-wide pack leading at the first turn. Fierceness was still in third with four furlongs to go.\n\nAfter Mystik Dan made his charge to the lead along the inside rail in the final turn, Fierceness faded, finishing 15th.\n\n\"He had the hop at the start, and we kind of had to hustle a little more than we wanted to,\" trainer Todd Pletcher said. \"Got some pressure on both sides coming by the eighth pole. ... Finally got to the position we wanted, but (jockey) Johnny (Velazquez) said he was a little bit too geared up at that point.\"\n\nThe pace-setters\n\nJust Steel, Epic Ride and Track Phantom helped set the early pace alongside Fierceness but all finished out of contention. Track Phantom was 11th, Epic Ride was 14th and Just Steel, who is trained by D. Wayne Lukas, was 17th.\n\n\"I was on the lead for a while,\" Track Phantom's jockey, Joel Rosario, said. \"He ran his race but we couldn't hang in there. He did his best.\"\n\nJockey Keith Asmussen said Just Steel was squeezed leaving the gate, and Lukas said the early pace was too fast.\n\n\"It was probably a little too fast for the opening quarter-mile,\" Epic Ride's jockey, Adam Beschizza, said. \"I was a little too aggressive going past the wire. It was a rough, busy race. I was able to keep it uninterrupted for the most for him. It's just probably a bit too far.\"\n\nThe rest of the field\n\nSanta Anita Derby-winner Stronghold was fourth heading into the final turn but finished seventh, just behind Wood Memorial winner Resilience. Honor Marie, who was last at the first turn, finished eighth.\n\n\"My race was over coming out of the gate,\" Honor Marie's jockey, Ben Curtis, said. \"I got speared from both sides, I lost an iron and had to put it back in. He was nearly down on his head but I gave him time to pick himself up. He didn't get the smoothest first quarter of a mile and I just let him float around a bit after that. Then I took to the inside because I didn't want to give away any more ground. He paid for the early exertion but he ran a credible race.\"\n\nEndlessly and Dornoch rounded out the top 10.\n\n\"He had a very bad trip,\" Dornoch's trainer, Danny Gargan, said. \"He was eliminated early. He got very tired. I'm disappointed in the way he ran today.\"\n\nWest Saratoga, whose trainer Larry Demeritte became the first Black trainer to saddle a horse in the Derby since 1989, finished 11th.\n\nDomestic Product (12th), Society Man (16th), Grand Mo the First (18th), Catalytic (19th) and Just a Touch (20th) were never really in the mix.", "source": {"uri": "kentucky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexington Herald Leader"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_hale@kentucky.com", "name": "Jon Hale", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forever_Young_(Alphaville_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forever Young (Alphaville song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington_Herald-Leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lexington Herald-Leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Brown_(horse_trainer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chad Brown (horse trainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Grass_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue Grass Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Wayne_Lukas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D.

He quickly opened up a daylight advantage on the field.\n\n\"When he shot through that spot, he was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it,\" Hernandez said. \"He shot off and I'm like, 'Oh man, I've got a big chance to win the Kentucky Derby.'\"\n\nTo Mystik Dan's outside, Sierra Leone and Forever Young took up the chase in the middle of the track.\n\nAs Mystik Dan sped along the rail, Sierra Leone lugged in and bumped Forever Young three times in the stretch, but jockey Ryusei Sakai didn't claim foul.\n\nMystik Dan got so close to the rail that Hernandez's boot struck it.\n\n\"But I think we can buy another pair of boots,\" he said.\n\nThe winner's share of the record $5 million purse was $3.1 million, with the jockey and trainer typically earning 10% each.\n\n\"Just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey and ride,\" McPeek said. \"Brian is one of the most underrated jockeys, but not anymore, right?\"\n\nSierra Leone, the second choice at 9-2 odds, and Forever Young from Japan came up just short at the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs, the largest crowd since 2018.\n\nIt was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- the closest margin in horse racing -- and the first since Grindstone edged Cavonnier to wear the garland of red roses in 1996.\n\nThe crowd waited several minutes in the heat and humidity as the result was reviewed by the stewards and declared official.\n\n\"The longest few minutes of my life,\" Hernandez said, after he and Mystik Dan walked in circles while the stunning result was settled. \"To see your number flash up to win the Derby, I don't think it will sink in for a while.\"\n\nFierceness finished 15th in the field of 20 3-year-olds.

The last jockey to do the Oaks-Derby double was Calvin Borel in 2009 with Rachel Alexandra and Mine That Bird. The last trainer to do the double was Ben Jones in 1952 with Real Delight and Hill Gail.\n\nMcPeek is only the fourth-ever trainer to do the Oaks-Derby double in the same year.\n\nAfter Friday's Kentucky Oaks was contested over a sloppy track and rain threatened throughout Saturday, the Derby was run over a fast main track at Churchill.\n\nIt didn't matter.

He entered the Derby with career earnings of $641,360, a total that will significantly increase after Saturday's result.\n\nThe bay-colored horse was bred in Kentucky and was sired by Goldencents. Mystik Dan's dam was Ma'am, by Colonel John.\n\nA homebred, Mystik Dan earned his first career win at Churchill Downs last November.\n\nThe 2024 Derby Day attendance was 156,710 spectators at Churchill Downs, an increase of more than 6,000 fans from the crowd of 150,335 people that gathered for last year's race.\n\nJockey Irad Ortiz Jr. dominates Derby undercard races\n\nAs always, several high-quality stakes races took place on the Derby undercard Saturday at Churchill Downs.\n\nThe early undercard races were dominated by jockey Irad Ortiz Jr., who won each of the Grade 2, $600,000 Twin Spires Turf Sprint Stakes, Grade 1, $1 million Derby City Distaff Stakes and Grade 2, $665,000 Longines Churchill Distaff Turf Mile Stakes.\n\nOrtiz won each of those races for a different trainer: Ortiz was aboard Cogburn for Steve Asmussen in a 2 1/4-length victory in the Turf Sprint, Vahva for Cherie DeVaux in a 2-length victory in the Derby City Distaff and Chili Flag (FR) for Chad Brown in a win that came by a neck in the Churchill Distaff Turf Mile.\n\nThe 88-year-old trainer D. Wayne Lukas teamed up with jockey Jaime Torres to win the Grade 2, $600,000 Pat Day Mile Stakes by 1 1/4 lengths with Seize the Grey, and trainer H. Graham Motion paired with jockey Umberto Rispoli to win the Grade 2, $600,000 American Turf Stakes with 47-1 long shot Trikari.\n\nAsmussen also won the Grade 1, $1 million Churchill Downs by 2 1/2 lengths with Gun Pilot, who was ridden by Cristian Torres.", "source": {"uri": "kentucky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexington Herald Leader"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_drummond@kentucky.com", "name": "Cameron Drummond", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graded stakes race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Oaks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Oaks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaklawn_Racing_Casino_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oaklawn Racing Casino Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_A._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben A.

GRAVES Associated Press\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The second jewel of horse racing's Triple Crown could be missing 150th Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and other co-stars, quashing hopes for a rematch after the thrilling three-wide photo finish in the milestone race.\n\nTrainer Kenny McPeek and the horse's ownership wouldn't commit to whether the colt would race in the 149th Preakness on May 18 in Baltimore, which requires a quick two-week turnaround. Mystik Dan will travel to Saratoga, New York, before they decide whether to enter him in the 1 3/16 mile Preakness.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek said Sunday morning outside his barn on Churchill Downs' back side. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. ... So, we'll just watch him over the next week. It'll be one of those (situations) where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The Belmont has also been shortened to a 1 1/4 mile, matching the Derby distance that Mystik Dan won by a nose over Sierra Leone and Japan-bred Forever Young in the closest three-way finish since 1947.\n\nThe five-week gap follows a more normal race schedule for many thoroughbreds and some trainers might opt to head to Saratoga to acclimate horses sooner.\n\nChad Brown said Sierra Leone will skip the Preakness and leave on Monday to train at Saratoga and run the Belmont. Considering how much it took for Sierra Leone to navigate other horses and chase down Mystik Dan before falling a nose short at the wire, rest sounds necessary.\n\n\"He's a real laid back horse but when we brought him out, was a little more tired than he normally is after his races,\" Brown said. \"I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nLouisville-born trainer Brad Cox is watching Catching Freedom (fourth) and Just A Touch (20th) before deciding their next steps. Forever Young and fellow Japan-bred T O Password (fifth) are headed home on Tuesday.\n\nThat could leave the Preakness without some Derby star power at first glance, though it won't lack for plotlines with a number of well-rested horses expected to compete at Pimlico Race Course.\n\nHall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert could have two entrants as he seeks to follow up National Treasure's victory there last spring. He trains Santa Anita Derby runner-up Imagination and Arkansas Derby winner Muth, who missed the Derby after failed legal attempts by owner Amr Zedan to get him in despite Baffert's suspension by Churchill Downs through the end of 2024.\n\nAs McPeek and the owners ponder a decision, he and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. basked in a wash of congratulations for a Derby victory that put them in exclusive company.\n\nSaturday's win helped both claim rare weekend sweeps of the Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies. McPeek is just the third trainer to do that and first since Ben Jones (who did it twice) in 1952, while Hernandez is the eighth rider to achieve the feat and first since fellow Louisiana native and Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Mystik Dan just stood calm and unfazed as a cluster of onlookers took photos and selfies as workers bathed him outside the barn. He was then draped with the winner's blanket signifying his Derby win before being led back to his stall with a WWE-style title belt laying on an outer wall. Oaks-winning filly Thorpedo Anna also made a brief appearance and soaked in the attention.\n\nHernandez is preparing for his own life-changing spotlight and title after claiming the sport's marquee race. He dined with his family after the Derby but didn't sleep much, a routine that figures to go on for the next few days amid a flood of interview requests. At some point he hopes to get his mind around all that has happened, but he already has a response ready.\n\n\"When somebody asks what my profession is, I'm able to tell them I'm a professional jockey. And then the first question they normally ask is, 'Have you ever won the Kentucky Derby?' I can say that now.\"\n\nClose 1 of 11\n\nA race fan sits in the stands Saturday at Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby horse race in Louisville, Ky.\n\nBrynn Anderson,

I'm like, 'Wow, what just happened?'\" he said.\n\nHernandez scrapped his travel, choosing instead to celebrate dinner the evening of May 4 with his wife, Jamie, and other family and friends at Jeff Ruby's Steakhouse in Louisville, Ky.\n\nNot far from Mystik Dan's stall outside the barn of trainer Kenny McPeek on Sunday morning, Hernandez, McPeek, and Lance and Sharilyn Gasaway -- members of the partnership that owns Mystik Dan -- looked tired but happy.\n\nSign up for BloodHorse Daily\n\nThe same description applied to the horse, who, as is typical for a Kentucky Derby winner, was led out of his stall for a photo opportunity before a throng of photographers and media. He was subdued and, after a bath, returned inside the barn to walk some laps in the shedrow before being led back to his stall. He wore a blanket celebrating him as the winner of the 150th Kentucky Derby.\n\nMystik Dan showed signs of his hard race, in which he outlasted Sierra Leone and Forever Young in a three-horse photo finish.\n\n\"Look, most trainers don't talk about all this. But cards on the table, face up -- he left three quarts (of) feed,\" McPeek said. \"We couldn't hardly get everybody out of the barn until midnight, so he couldn't really get a great night's rest.\"\n\nMcPeek was noncommittal about whether Mystik Dan, who races for Lance Gasaway, 4 G Racing, Daniel Hamby III and Valley View Farm, would pursue the May 18 Preakness Stakes (G1) at Pimlico Race Course or await the June 8 Belmont Stakes (G1), taking place this year at Saratoga Race Course. The 1 3/16-mile Preakness and Belmont Stakes, shortened to 1 1/4 miles this year due to being at Saratoga, are the remaining legs of the Triple Crown, a series last swept by Justify in 2018. Justify became the 13th winner of the Triple Crown.\n\nIn part due to the lure of the Triple Crown, and the eventual stallion value that comes to a horse that can sweep the series, Kentucky Derby winners often return in the Preakness. But some have skipped the race, most recently Rich Strike in 2022, to await the Belmont, where he ran sixth.\n\nLast year's Kentucky Derby winner, Mage , ran third in the Preakness. His connections then bowed out of running him in the Belmont.\n\nMcPeek noted that Mystik Dan ran below form when he previously raced him on two weeks of rest in the fall of 2023, finishing fifth in an allowance optional claiming race at Churchill Downs Nov. 25. Since then, the trainer has given his colt a month or more off between starts.\n\nLance and Sharilyn Gasaway said they plan to have input in whether Mystik Dan races on a short turnaround in the Preakness, with their emphasis on what's best for their colt, a homebred bay 3-year-old of Goldencents .\n\nThe colt, who they bred out of the Colonel John mare Ma'am , won the Feb. 3 Southwest Stakes (G3) at Oaklawn Park this winter and was third in the Arkansas Derby (G1) preceding the Kentucky Derby. He now has earnings of $3,741,360, earning the bulk of that with his first-place finish worth $3.1 million in the Derby.\n\n\"It's all about the horse. See how the horse comes out of the race, give him two or three days,\" Lance Gasaway said. \"If he comes out of it good, we'll look at it. If not -- we'll look at the horse more than anything.\"\n\nMcPeek said he and his wife Sherri would leave for Saratoga to prepare his stable for horses for being sent there soon.\n\nThe trainer said, \"There's a better-than-average chance that we're going to send him and some others to Saratoga\" from Churchill Downs.\n\nHe plans to have Mystik Dan resume training in the middle of this week.\n\nThorpedo Anna , McPeek's Kentucky Oaks (G1) winner for owners Brookdale Racing, Mark Edwards, Judy Hicks, and Sherri McPeek's Magdalena Racing, was also photographed Sunday. She could also be headed soon to Saratoga. Thorpedo Anna is pointed to either the $500,000 Acorn Stakes (G1) June 7 there or the $2 million Belmont Stakes against males. Not having originally been a Triple Crown nominee, she would require a $50,000 supplement to race in the Belmont.\n\nMcPeek, who won the 2020 Preakness with the filly Swiss Skydiver and the 2002 Belmont Stakes with longshot Sarava , was asked if he would have reservations about running the two together in the Belmont.\n\n\"Yes, I would. I can't get Brian on both of them,\" he said of the jockey, whom he again credited with a ground-saving, difference-making ride in the Derby.", "source": {"uri": "bloodhorse.com", "dataType": "news",

Forever Young from Japan and Sierra Leone gave chase and pressured the leader to the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs.\n\nThe crowd waited several minutes before the result was reviewed by the stewards and declared official.\n\nHernandez and trainer Kenny McPeek had teamed to win the Kentucky Oaks for fillies on Friday with Thorpedo Anna.\n\nMystik Dan ran 1 1/4 miles in 2:03.34 and paid $39.22 to win.\n\nThe 150th Run for the Roses would have been unrecognizable to the 10,000 people who attended that first race at an unknown track on the rural outskirts of Louisville, Kentucky. Now more than 157,000 pack into Churchill Downs from all over the world for a dayslong spectacle of huge hats and mint juleps, where most grandstand tickets cost more than $500 and celebrities celebrate in lavish suites high above the track.\n\nThe sun was shining Saturday, and Derby-goers didn't have to contend with the bad news that put a damper on the race last year, when seven horses died in the week leading into the race.

After a seventh-place finish, the owners moved the colt to a different trainer.\n\nMystik Dan was a different colt, however.

GRAVES Associated Press\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The second jewel of horse racing's Triple Crown could be missing 150th Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and other co-stars, quashing hopes for a rematch after the thrilling three-wide photo finish in the milestone race.\n\nTrainer Kenny McPeek and the horse's ownership wouldn't commit to whether the colt would race in the 149th Preakness on May 18 in Baltimore, which requires a quick two-week turnaround. Mystik Dan will travel to Saratoga, New York, before they decide whether to enter him in the 1 3/16 mile Preakness.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek said Sunday morning outside his barn on Churchill Downs' back side. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. ... So, we'll just watch him over the next week. It'll be one of those (situations) where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The Belmont has also been shortened to a 1 1/4 mile, matching the Derby distance that Mystik Dan won by a nose over Sierra Leone and Japan-bred Forever Young in the closest three-way finish since 1947.\n\nThe five-week gap follows a more normal race schedule for many thoroughbreds and some trainers might opt to head to Saratoga to acclimate horses sooner.\n\nChad Brown said Sierra Leone will skip the Preakness and leave on Monday to train at Saratoga and run the Belmont. Considering how much it took for Sierra Leone to navigate other horses and chase down Mystik Dan before falling a nose short at the wire, rest sounds necessary.\n\n\"He's a real laid back horse but when we brought him out, was a little more tired than he normally is after his races,\" Brown said. \"I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nLouisville-born trainer Brad Cox is watching Catching Freedom (fourth) and Just A Touch (20th) before deciding their next steps. Forever Young and fellow Japan-bred T O Password (fifth) are headed home on Tuesday.\n\nThat could leave the Preakness without some Derby star power at first glance, though it won't lack for plotlines with a number of well-rested horses expected to compete at Pimlico Race Course.\n\nHall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert could have two entrants as he seeks to follow up National Treasure's victory there last spring. He trains Santa Anita Derby runner-up Imagination and Arkansas Derby winner Muth, who missed the Derby after failed legal attempts by owner Amr Zedan to get him in despite Baffert's suspension by Churchill Downs through the end of 2024.\n\nAs McPeek and the owners ponder a decision, he and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. basked in a wash of congratulations for a Derby victory that put them in exclusive company.\n\nSaturday's win helped both claim rare weekend sweeps of the Derby and Kentucky Oaks for fillies. McPeek is just the third trainer to do that and first since Ben Jones (who did it twice) in 1952, while Hernandez is the eighth rider to achieve the feat and first since fellow Louisiana native and Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Mystik Dan just stood calm and unfazed as a cluster of onlookers took photos and selfies as workers bathed him outside the barn. He was then draped with the winner's blanket signifying his Derby win before being led back to his stall with a WWE-style title belt laying on an outer wall. Oaks-winning filly Thorpedo Anna also made a brief appearance and soaked in the attention.\n\nHernandez is preparing for his own life-changing spotlight and title after claiming the sport's marquee race. He dined with his family after the Derby but didn't sleep much, a routine that figures to go on for the next few days amid a flood of interview requests.

(WDRB) - A morning after the closest Kentucky Derby finish in 28 years and the first three-horse photo finish in 72 years, the Churchill Downs backside was still buzzing not only over Mystik Dan's victory by a nose, but over the bumping battle for second between Sierra Leone and Japanese contender Forever Young.\n\nPhotographs after the race showed Sierra Leone's jockey, Tyler Gaffalione, reaching out with his left hand and making contact with Forever Young and his rider, Ryusei Sakai. Sierra Leone made a stirring rally, having to go eight-wide on the track, to get second in the race. The third-place finish for Forever Young was the best ever for a horse out of Japan.\n\nAsked why no claim of foul was made after the race, owner Susumu Fujita's racing manager, Hiroshi Ando, told Churchill Downs, \"Claims of foul do not happen much in Japan. It is the stewards' call, not us.\"\n\nNo stewards inquiry was posted after the race, which Mystik Dan won in a time of 2:03.34, the fifth time in the past 10 runnings of the Kentucky Derby that the winning time was in excess of 2:03 (American Pharoah, Always Dreaming, Justify and Country House also failed to break 2:03).\n\nSierra Leone and Foreverr Young raced in incredibly tight quarters down the lane as both furiously tried to reel in Mystik Dan, who made an inside move under jockey Brian Hernandez and drew clear in midstretch.\n\nThe effort his horse gave to get up for second encouraged trainer Chad Brown, though he said he wouldn't take the colt to the Preakness.\n\n\"There was so much bumping going on there,\" Brown said. \"When horses are fatigued, they have a tendency to lean in a bit like he did with his last two wins and it's going to be more exaggerated when they're more tired. He had so much to do and by the time he got to the eighth pole, he was leaning in a bit.\"\n\nGaffalione said after the race on Saturday, \"I felt like I had plenty of horse,\" Gaffalione said. \"He wanted to lean in today and made it a little difficult. I had a hard time keeping him straight and it definitely cost us. He gives you everything. Very responsive but he loses concentration.\"\n\nBrown said his jockey was trying to get room to use the whip with his left hand, which the horse responds to. But the bumping made that impossible.\n\n\"What Tyler was attempting to do is make room for his left stick, which the horse really respects, and keep him straight,\" Brown said. \"And he was looking for sort of a pathway to use his left stick. But with the bumping, the tight duel between those two horses, it disarmed him with the stick. All he had was a rein to pull on and it really hurt his momentum. He couldn't use it because he had no room to use his left stick without hitting his horse. He didn't want to do that either. So he was trying create a path not only to straighten out my horse who really respects that, he was trying not to foul the other horse with the stick.\"\n\nBrown said, given all of the adversity, he thought his horse ran well enough to win, but just didn't get the result in the end.\n\n\"I'm disappointed with the result, but I'm so proud of the horse, Brown said. \"In my mind, he ran the best race. That's no disrespect to the winner. It's just, it's a hard race to win, everything has to go right. With the winner, the horse showed up and was prepared right and he ran terrific. You have to have a trip where everything goes right. It's not (Mystik Dan's) fault the doors opened for him, I wish that would have happened for me. But I don't think less of the winner's performance. It's just an example of two trips. But that's what has to happen here. For us, I don't think we had a bad trip. But our horse was very far back on a track that favors speed and he had to go around a lot of horses and he had a ton of ground to make up. To almost get there despite all that, I really feel he ran the best race. We'll see going forward the rest of the year where he stacks up with the entire body of work.\"\n\nAs for the Japanese contingent, they, too, will head home disappointed in the result, but encouraged that they're getting closer.\n\nAndo said that trainer Yoshito Yahagi was disappointed Forever Young lost, but \"how he ran his race made us so proud.\"\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nBOZICH | After dramatic Derby win, McPeek says it's too soon to commit Mystik Dan to PreaknessMystik Dan wins 150th Kentucky DerbyChurchill Downs welcomes race fans for milestone Kentucky Derby 150CRAWFORD | Hernandez takes Mystik Dan on a rail ride to Kentucky Derby glory\n\nCopyright 2024 WDRB Media.

Latest news about 2024 Kentucky Derby winner's plans for next Triple Crown race", "body": "Mystik Dan put himself into the history books Saturday, winning the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby. Now, the horse's ownership group is facing a key question in the wake of its big win.\n\nWill they run the Preakness Stakes and compete for a Triple Crown title, or will Mystik Dan sit the race out and take aim at the Belmont Stakes crown?\n\nSome may presume that the group would answer \"yes\" without hesitation. After all, only 13 horses have won the Triple Crown, so why wouldn't Mystik Dan's group try to become the 14th?\n\nBut nowadays, trainers and owners are much more aware of their horse's needs, so if they believe there is a benefit to resting the horse, they won't hesitate to do it.\n\nHere's what to know about Mystik Dan's potential Preakness run and why he isn't guaranteed to be in the field at Pilmico.\n\nMORE: How much prize money does the Kentucky Derby winner get in 2024?\n\nMystik Dan's ownership group has not yet decided if the 3-year-old colt will compete in the Preakness Stakes, as trainer Kenny McPeek revealed Sunday at Churchill Downs.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek told reporters, per ESPN. \"I ran him back once in two weeks, and it completely backfired on me. ... So we'll just watch him over the next week. It'll be one of those [situations] where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\n\n\"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nMystik Dan wouldn't be the only Kentucky Derby contender to skip the Preakness. Sierra Leone, who finished second in the race, won't be running in the race and will instead take aim at the Belmont Stakes.\n\n\"He's a real laid-back horse but, when we brought him out, was a little more tired than he normally is after his races,\" Sierra Leone's trainer Chad Brown said. \"I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nThe last Kentucky Derby winner not to run the Preakness was Rich Strike in 2022. Rich Strike was a late entrant to the Derby field but later ran the Belmont Stakes.\n\nMORE: What to know about Brian Hernandez, the jockey of derby-winning Mystik Dan\n\nPart of the reason that more horses are skipping the Preakness Stakes is that it is held just two weeks after the Kentucky Derby. That scheduling pattern is holding true in 2024.\n\nThe 149th running of the Preakness will take place on Saturday, May 18. The post time for the race is 6:50 p.m. ET from Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore.\n\nJustify was the last Kentucky Derby winner to also win the Preakness. He did so in 2018 en route to winning the Triple Crown by winning the Belmont Stakes three weeks later.\n\nMORE: How Mystik Dan got his unique name\n\nThirteen horses have won the Triple Crown. Only two have achieved the feat since 1979: Justify in 2018 and American Pharoah, who ended a 37-year Triple Crown drought in 2015.\n\nHere is the full list of Triple Crown-winning horses and jockeys, from Sir Barton and Johnny Loftus in 1919 to Justify and Mike Smith in 2018.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Strike", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rich Strike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Loftus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Loftus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justify_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justify (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_E._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike E.

Yet, the Ken McPeek-trained colt raced to victory at Churchill Downs on Saturday, beating out Sierra Leone and Forever Young in a photo finish.\n\nNow, the focus shifts to the second leg of horse racing's three-race Triple Crown schedule: the Preakness Stakes, scheduled for May 18. The big question at this point is whether Mystik Dan will be among the horses in the field.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness, not yet,\" McPeek said Sunday morning, per Gary B. Graves of the Associated Press. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me. ... So, we'll just watch him over the next week. It'll be one of those [situations] where we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\"\n\nSierra Leone and Forever Young won't be racing the Preakness. So, who will be competing at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore in less than two weeks?\n\nHere's everything we know about the 2024 Preakness Stakes thus far.\n\nThe betting window for Preakness futures bets closed Saturday about an hour before the Kentucky Derby. At that time, Mystik Dan had 45-1 odds to win the Preakness. However, those will surely improve once new lines are released.\n\nIf Mystik Dan races the Preakness, he will likely be among the top favorites. For one, he just won the Kentucky Derby. Also, the field isn't likely to be stacked due to plenty of Derby horses not being entered into the race.\n\nHowever, there's also one non-Derby horse to keep a close eye on: Muth.\n\nBefore the Preakness futures window ended, Muth had the best odds to win the race at 7-2. There's a good chance he'll still be the favorite over Mystik Dan when new odds come out.\n\nMuth didn't race the Kentucky Derby because trainer Bob Baffert is suspended from Churchill Downs through the end of the year due to 2021 Derby winner Medina Spirit failing a test betamethasone, a banned steroid.\n\nBut Baffert has been allowed to enter horses at races at Pimlico Race Course. Last year, he was victorious at the Preakness for the eighth time, as National Treasure crossed the finish line first.\n\nMuth has finished either first or second in each of his first six races, which included a win at the Arkansas Derby in March. So he appears poised to be the front-runner at this year's Preakness.\n\nBut Mystik Dan now has an impressive resume himself. He owns three victories, with two coming over his past three races. He also hasn't finished worse than third during that span.\n\nIt's possible that Catching Freedom (who finished fourth in the Kentucky Derby) will race the Preakness.

However, there was a lot of racing luck involved, because the strategy employed by jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. was to drop back in the early going and save his mount's best for the homestretch.\n\nThe good fortune commenced when no other rider in front of him opted to take his place on the inside. Mystik Dan dropped back as far as eighth place in the run around the first turn and, with a virtual highway open in front of him down the backstretch, began to close in on those in the vanguard.\n\nEven rounding the far turn, no other jockey opted to save ground by dropping over to the rail. Possibly, the reason for hesitancy was the fact that rain had doused the Downs' surface Friday evening. Water does roll downhill and, especially on the banked turns, the inside dries last.\n\nRegardless of the water content, Mystik Dan continued to close ground and pulled even with the leaders at the top of the home lane. Opening a two-length lead midway down the stretch, Hernandez kept busy with his mount, as danger was developing from the outside.\n\nLocked in a head-and-head battle, Sierra Leone and the Japanize-import Forever Young were closing with a rush, the latter leaning on his immediate rival and bumping him several times during the stretch run. As this duo closed in, it became a question of whether they would overtake Mystik Dan before or after crossing the finish line.\n\nThey didn't quite make it, but it was awfully close. The photo-finish camera revealed Mystik Dan a nose in front and Sierra Leone a nose ahead of Forever Young.

In addition to Forever Young's third-place effort, T O Password used a late charge to finish in fifth, a more-than credible effort given his long-shot 48-1 post-time odds.\n\nForever Young, who battled second-place finisher Sierra Leone in a rough-and-tumble stretch run, went off at 7-1 odds.\n\nThe first time a horse shipped from Japan to Louisville to run the Kentucky Derby was in 1995, when Ski Captain finished 14th. The first time a horse born in Japan competed in the Derby was Master Fencer, who finished sixth as a long shot in 2019.\n\nForever Young and T O Password represented the seventh and eighth horses all-time with ties to Japan to compete in the Run for the Roses, and they produced the two best results from that group.\n\n\"He's a very fast closing horse,\" Forever Young's jockey, Ryusei Sakai, told media members prior to the Derby via a translator. \"He's got that late kick.\"\n\nSakai, along with trainer, Yoshito Yahagi, both made their Derby debuts with Forever Young, who is 5-0-1 in six career starts and has amassed more than $2.5 million in career earnings.\n\nAt least one Japanese horse has competed in each of the last three Kentucky Derbys: Crown Pride was 13th in 2022, Mandarin Hero was 12th in 2023 and Derma Sotogake was sixth in 2023.\n\nAs the pedigree of Japanese horses has improved, so has their prominence.\n\nThere's a reason Forever Young had 7-1 odds at post time of this year's race: He came to Kentucky undefeated in five previous starts. T O Password arrived at Churchill Downs a perfect 2-for-2 in his racing career.\n\nAnd in running quality races Saturday night beneath the Twin Spires, both horses bucked significant historical trends.\n\nForever Young made the Kentucky Derby gate as a result of winning the Grade 2 UAE Derby in late March. Before him, UAE Derby runners who then raced in Louisville had never finished better than fifth in the Kentucky Derby. In addition to delivering Japan its first top-three finisher in Kentucky Derby history, Forever Young did the same for runners from the UAE Derby, a race that has existed since 2000.\n\nForever Young also became the first foreign-born horse to finish in the money in the Kentucky Derby since Great Britain-bred Bold Arrangement ran second in 1989.\n\nT O Password -- who earned his Derby spot via the Japanese qualifying pathway -- was lightly raced entering the Derby. Only one horse (Leonatus in 1883) has won the Derby with just two previous races. While T O Password finished more than six lengths behind winner Mystik Dan and behind a finishing group that also included fourth-place runner Catching Freedom, T O Password's fifth-place effort still saw him finish above a slew of top Derby contenders, including morning line and post-time favorite Fierceness (15th).\n\n\"He didn't break well,\" T O Password's jockey, Kazushi Kimura, said after the Derby. \"This was his third time running and he was in a new country. He probably wasn't 100% mature. Today he finished up strong. I hope the horse can stay for the Preakness.\"\n\nThe next step from this clear progression is for a Japanese horse to go and win the Derby, which is a feat easier said than done.\n\nNo horse bred outside of North America has won the Kentucky Derby since Great Britain's Tomy Lee in 1959.\n\nBut it's clear Japanese horses have arrived in a big way on the global racing stage.\n\nIn 2021, Japan made a big mark at the Breeders' Cup World Championships at Del Mar when Loves Only You won the Filly & Mare Turf and Marche Lorraine won the Distaff. These were the first Japanese horses to win a Breeders' Cup race.\n\nLast Friday, the Japanese also nearly scored a win on Kentucky Oaks Day at Churchill Downs: Sakai, Forever Young's jockey, was aboard T O Saint Denis in a front-running, second-place effort in the Grade 2 Alysheba Stakes.\n\nBut with the Breeders' Cup box checked, all eyes are now on the Kentucky Derby for Japanese horse racing's next big moment.\n\nAnd it should be coming soon.\n\n\"Of course they want to win the Derby,\" Sakai said of the Japanese horse racing industry prior to this year's race.", "source": {"uri":

(AP) -- Brian Hernandez Jr. will need a minute to digest his signature victory in the 150th Kentucky Derby.\n\nMaybe even more time since the milestone derby capped the best weekend of a jockey career spent mostly under the radar.\n\nThe Louisiana native rode Mystik Dan to an epic win Saturday at Churchill Downs, sliding past favorite Fierceness along the rail at the final turn and holding off Sierra Leone and Forever Young by a nose in an epic three-horse photo finish. Hernandez wasn't even sure he had won until seeing the replay and keeping his eyes glued to the flat screen that showed the continuous loop.\n\n\"I'm like, woo, I think we just won the Kentucky Derby,\" the 38-year-old said. \"But then those horses, they were so far out there, you couldn't really see them. And then they surged so quickly.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh man, I hope we won. I hope we won.' And then when they hung up our number, it was just instant relief.\"\n\nHernandez's derby victory aboard Mystik Dan at 18-1 odds came a day after he rode filly Thorpedo Anna to a wire-to-wire rout by 4 3/4 lengths in the 150th Kentucky Oaks. That made him the first jockey to complete the Derby/Oaks double since Hall of Famer Calvin Borel achieved the feat aboard Mine That Bird and filly Rachel Alexandra, respectively, in 2009. Kenny McPeek became the first trainer to earn the double since Ben Jones in 1952.\n\n\"We came into the weekend thinking we had really good chances both Friday and Saturday,\" Hernandez added. \"To have the horses pull it off for us, we really have to thank all the guys back in the barn.\n\n\"I don't know how long it's going to take to sink in. It's definitely a surreal moment.\"\n\nHernandez's victory was fitting since he studied Borel's derby wins aboard Mine That Bird and Super Saver (2010), along with being around him during 20 years of racing in Kentucky. Those lessons paid off as he broke through after four derby finishes ranging from eighth to 12th, including 11th last May on Sun Thunder.\n\nHis seminal moment shouldn't have been shocking considering Hernandez already had an Eclipse Award to his name as top apprentice rider in 2004 along with a Breeders' Cup Classic win in 2012 with Fort Larned. He also was third in the Preakness two years ago with Creative Minister and has a slew of graded stakes wins.\n\nWinning the Kentucky Derby brings a whole different type of recognition, along with a sparkling title that will precede Hernandez for the rest of his life. McPeek asserted immediately afterward that the rider can no longer be considered underrated after a \"brilliant\" ride and called the gutsy inside path taken to victory typical for the jockey.\n\n\"He knows what to do there,\" McPeek said. \"I always had a world of confidence in him. Rarely second-guess anything he does.\"\n\nHowever, the victory created a travel issue for Hernandez, who had planned on head to Louisiana on Sunday morning for a jazz festival.

(AP) -- Brian Hernandez Jr. will need a minute to digest his signature victory in the 150th Kentucky Derby.\n\nMaybe even more time since the milestone derby capped the best weekend of a jockey career spent mostly under the radar.\n\nThe Louisiana native rode Mystik Dan to an epic win Saturday at Churchill Downs, sliding past favorite Fierceness along the rail at the final turn and holding off Sierra Leone and Forever Young by a nose in an epic three-horse photo finish. Hernandez wasn't even sure he had won until seeing the replay and keeping his eyes glued to the flat screen that showed the continuous loop.\n\n\"I'm like, woo, I think we just won the Kentucky Derby,\" the 38-year-old said. \"But then those horses, they were so far out there, you couldn't really see them. And then they surged so quickly.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh man, I hope we won. I hope we won.' And then when they hung up our number, it was just instant relief.\"\n\nHernandez's derby victory aboard Mystik Dan at 18-1 odds came a day after he rode filly Thorpedo Anna to a wire-to-wire rout by 4 3/4 lengths in the 150th Kentucky Oaks. That made him the first jockey to complete the Derby/Oaks double since Hall of Famer Calvin Borel achieved the feat aboard Mine That Bird and filly Rachel Alexandra, respectively, in 2009. Kenny McPeek became the first trainer to earn the double since Ben Jones in 1952.\n\n\"We came into the weekend thinking we had really good chances both Friday and Saturday,\" Hernandez added. \"To have the horses pull it off for us, we really have to thank all the guys back in the barn.\n\n\"I don't know how long it's going to take to sink in. It's definitely a surreal moment.\"\n\nHernandez's victory was fitting since he studied Borel's derby wins aboard Mine That Bird and Super Saver (2010), along with being around him during 20 years of racing in Kentucky. Those lessons paid off as he broke through after four derby finishes ranging from eighth to 12th, including 11th last May on Sun Thunder.\n\nHis seminal moment shouldn't have been shocking considering Hernandez already had an Eclipse Award to his name as top apprentice rider in 2004 along with a Breeders' Cup Classic win in 2012 with Fort Larned. He also was third in the Preakness two years ago with Creative Minister and has a slew of graded stakes wins.\n\nWinning the Kentucky Derby brings a whole different type of recognition, along with a sparkling title that will precede Hernandez for the rest of his life. McPeek asserted immediately afterward that the rider can no longer be considered underrated after a \"brilliant\" ride and called the gutsy inside path taken to victory typical for the jockey.\n\n\"He knows what to do there,\" McPeek said. \"I always had a world of confidence in him. Rarely second-guess anything he does.\"\n\nHowever, the victory created a travel issue for Hernandez, who had planned on head to Louisiana on Sunday morning for a jazz festival. It's a switch he was more than willing to make after two remarkable days that demonstrated what the right mounts can yield.\n\n\"You know, it's horse racing, it's not jockey racing,\" said Hernandez, who planned to celebrate with his wife on Saturday night. \"Just about any jockey out there, if they have the right horse, they can get them to the winner's circle. You just you have to be willing to put in the time and the effort to find the right horses.\"\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show Hernandez had one Breeders' Cup victory, not two.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- Mystik Dan won the 150th Kentucky Derby in a dramatic three-horse photo finish, edging out Sierra Leone and Forever Young for the upset victory. It was the 10th Derby to be decided by a nose, the closest margin in horse racing. Sent off at 18-1 odds, Mystik Dan and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. rode the rail down the stretch with a short lead. Sierra Leone and Forever Young from Japan gave chase and pressured the leader to the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs on Saturday. Hernandez and trainer Kenny McPeek had teamed to win the Kentucky Oaks for fillies a day earlier with Thorpedo Anna. Mystik Dan ran 1 1/4 miles in 2:03.34 and paid $39.22 to win.\n\nEdwards scores 43 points, Reid erupts in 4th to help Timberwolves beat Nuggets 106-99 in Game 1\n\nDENVER (AP) -- Anthony Edwards scored a playoff career-high 43 points, Naz Reid had 14 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter and the Minnesota Timberwolves beat the defending NBA champion Denver Nuggets 106-99 in Game 1 of the second-round series Saturday night. Edwards was unstoppable in the first half, scoring 25 points, and Reid took over in the fourth quarter. Game 2 is Monday night in Denver. Three days after undergoing knee surgery, Timberwolves coach Chris Finch was on the bench in the second row, next to the scorer's table and behind assistant coach Micah Nori, who did the instructing, roaming and switching. Two-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic had 32 points, eight rebounds and nine assists for Denver.\n\nMessi has a record-setting game with a goal and 5 assists in Inter Miami's 6-2 win over Red Bulls\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Lionel Messi set three MLS records with a goal and five assists as Inter Miami trounced the New York Red Bulls 6-2. His six goal contributions, five assists and five assists in a half were all league records. Fresh after earning MLS Player of the Month Award for April, Messi has scored and assisted in six consecutive league matches. Luis Su\u00e1rez had three goals and Matias Rojas scored twice as Inter Miami scored six unanswered goals to come from a 1-0 deficit at halftime. Inter Miami remains atop the Eastern Conference with 24 points. Dante Vanzeir gave New York the first-half lead.

Madrid reclaimed the domestic crown after beating Cadiz 3-0 earlier Saturday and Barcelona then lost 4-2 at Girona. Only a victory by Barcelona would have stopped Madrid from celebrating. Girona leapfrogged Barcelona and pushed its Catalan rival into third place at 14 points behind Madrid. Madrid hosts Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday with their semifinal evenly balanced after a 2-2 first-leg draw in Germany.\n\nTaylor Pendrith leads Byron Nelson as one of several seeking first PGA Tour victory\n\nMcKINNEY, Texas (AP) -- Taylor Pendrith has a one-shot lead going into the final round of the CJ Cup Byron Nelson.

(AP) -- Jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. rode Mystik Dan to victory in the 150th Kentucky Derby to complete the most rewarding weekend of his career. The Eclipse Award winner and Breeders' Cup champion won the milestone derby a day after guiding filly Thorpedo Anna to a wire-to-wire victory by 4 3/4 lengths in the Kentucky Oaks. He became the first jockey to complete the Derby/Oaks double since Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009, fitting considering Hernandez studied Borel's derby wins and spent time with him in his Kentucky racing career. And, he's no longer under the radar as a jockey.\n\nKentucky Derby fans pack the track for the 150th Run for the Roses\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Fans packed into Churchill Downs Saturday for the 150th Kentucky Derby, the longest continuously held sporting event in the country, and many said they felt the milestone made race day feel extra special this year. Some said that as they approached the track, they imagined what Churchill Downs must have been at that first race on May 17, 1875, when patrons arrived to watch the horses by riding horses there themselves. The 150th Run for the Roses would be unrecognizable to the 10,000 people who attended that first race. More than 157,000 arrived at Churchill Down from all over the United States for a dayslong spectacle of huge hats and mint juleps.\n\nYankees slugger Aaron Judge ejected for first time in his career\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge was ejected for the first time in his career when he argued a called third strike by plate umpire Ryan Blakney in the seventh inning of Saturday's game against the Detroit Tigers. With one out, Judge took a full count fastball from Tyler Holton that he thought was slightly outside. Blakney rang him up, Judge glanced back and was ejected. After starting to walk back to the dugout, Judge returned to argue the call and manager Aaron Boone continued the argument.\n\nMaple Leafs star Auston Matthews is available for Game 7 with Bruins after sitting last 2 games\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Maple Leafs star and NHL goal-scoring leader Auston Matthews is available for their Game 7 matchup with the Boston Bruins. Matthews missed the last two games while dealing with an unspecified illness and had just four shots combined in Games 3 and 4. He had the Game 2 winner for the Maples Leafs, who are tied with Boston 3-3 in the first-round series. Toronto also announced that goalie Joseph Woll will not play in Game 7 due to an injury sustained in Game 6. Ilya Samsonov will get the nod between the pipes in his place. Samsonov started the first four games of the series when Toronto fell into a 3-1 hole and was outscored 12-6.\n\nHaaland scores 4 in another win for Man City. Arsenal isn't going away in the title race, though\n\nErling Haaland scored four goals in another win for Manchester City in its bid to capture an unprecedented fourth straight Premier League crown. Yet Arsenal isn't going away in this title race. Haaland has now at least a hat trick in six of his 63 matches in England's top flight after converting two penalties, powering in a header and curling home a sublime finish in City's 5-1 victory over Wolverhampton. It was a response to Arsenal's 3-0 win over Bournemouth a few hours earlier. Arsenal retained its one-point lead over City but the defending champions have three games left. That's one more than Arsenal. Burnley slipped closer to relegation with a 4-1 loss to Newcastle.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The last person to do it was a fellow Louisianan, Calvin Borel (2009).\n\nHernandez also delivered Lexington-based trainer Kenny McPeek his first Derby win in 10 tries. McPeek became just the third trainer (and the first since 1952) to hit the Oaks/Derby double.\n\nIt was also successful debut for owners Lance Gasaway, 4 G Racing (Brent Gasaway) and Daniel Hamby.\n\nAfter a dominant 4 3/4-length win Friday in Oaks 150 aboard Thorpedo Anna, Hernandez and the son of Goldencents broke from Post 3 at 18-1 odds and covered 1 1/4 miles in 2:03.34.\n\nIt was too close to call at the finish line at the finish line between them and Sierra Leone, ridden by reigning Oaks winner Tyler Gaffalione.\n\nMystik Dan improved to 3-1-1 across seven career starts -- and undefeated with Hernandez aboard with Saturday's win. The duo was coming off a third-place finish in the Grade 1 Arkansas Derby on March 30 at Oaklawn.\n\nThe son of a jockey, Hernandez began galloping horses for trainer Dale Angelle at age 12 and began his riding career at Delta Downs in November 2003, exercising horses in the mornings before high school classes and riding at night.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in May 2004, he headed to Churchill Downs, where he rode for a few weeks before returning to Louisiana and capturing his first riding title at Evangeline Downs.\n\nHernandez made his Derby debut in 2016, when he placed 12th with Tom's Ready. Until Saturday, his best finish was eighth in 2017 with McCraken.\n\nHe and McPeek have teamed up for each of his past three starts in the Run for the Roses. He placed ninth in 2021 with Tiz the Bomb and 11th last year with Sun Thunder.\n\nThis story will be updated.\n\nReach Louisville men's basketball reporter Brooks Holton at bholton@gannett.com and follow him on X at @brooksHolton.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Borel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Borel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lafayette,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lafayette, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lafayette, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Gaffalione", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Gaffalione"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldencents", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goldencents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delta Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangeline_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evangeline Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graded stakes race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Carriage_Driving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Carriage Driving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Barrel_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Barrel Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539947", "eventUri": "eng-9539947", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-30", "textStart": 1310, "textEnd": 1318}, {"amb": false, "date": "2003-11-", "textStart": 1467, "textEnd": 1480}, {"amb": false, "date": "2004-05-", "textStart": 1602, "textEnd": 1610}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

He noted that Bob Baffert-trained Muth, who beat Mystik Dan in the March 30 Arkansas Derby, is one of several well-rested contenders lining up to run at Pimlico Race Course.\n\n\"You take those horses in there at full speed, who have been off a month and a half and we're coming in off two weeks, that's a big ask of this horse,\" Gasaway told reporters in Louisville. \"We'll have to see how he comes out of the race.\"\n\nMcPeek said Mystik Dan will walk the next few days before he returns to training on the track at Churchill Downs, probably Wednesday. \"So we'll watch him over the next week, and probably decide then,\" he said of a possible Preakness entry (the deadline is May 13). \"It will be a last-minute decision. We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nMcPeek, who has won all three Triple Crown races after Mystik Dan outlasted Sierra Leone and Forever Young in a thrilling photo finish Saturday, acknowledged his reluctance to run back on short rest.\n\n\"When I ran him back in two weeks before, it completely backfired on me,\" he said, alluding to a pair of starts from Mystik Dan's 2-year-old season. He finished fifth in a flat performance at Churchill Downs in November, 13 days after his breakout victory on the same track.\n\nIf Mystik Dan were to skip the Preakness, he would be the second Derby champion to do so in the last three years after longshot winner Rick Strike went straight from Kentucky to the Belmont Stakes in 2022. Such a move would rekindle fears that the second jewel in the Triple Crown is becoming an afterthought. Few trainers even consider running their Derby horses two weeks later at Pimlico, believing the quick turnaround to be too great an ask for 3-year-olds no longer conditioned for such condensed rigor.\n\nThe last four Preakness winners did not run in the Derby. Justify was the last to win both races on his way to a Triple Crown in 2018.\n\nMuth earned enough qualifying points for a berth in the Derby and would have been among the top contenders, but his trainer, Baffert, remains barred from Churchill Downs because of the medication violation that cost Medina Spirit his 2021 Derby victory. Owner Amr Zedan sued unsuccessfully to get his horse into the 20-horse Derby field. Muth will instead enter the Preakness off seven weeks of rest.\n\nBaffert won his eighth Preakness last year with a similarly fresh horse, National Treasure, and his pair of Muth and Imagination, runner-up in the April 6 Santa Anita Derby, will present a daunting obstacle to any Derby runner looking to bounce back at Pimlico.\n\nNeither Sierra Leone nor Forever Young, the two horses that nearly caught Mystik Dan in the Derby, will run in the Preakness. Sierra Leone is headed for trainer Chad Brown's barn at Saratoga, New York, where he'll train for the June 8 Belmont Stakes (to be held at Saratoga Race Course because Belmont Park is under renovation). Forever Young is scheduled to fly back to Japan before a possible return to U.S. competition later this year.\n\nTrainer Brad Cox hasn't ruled out a Preakness run for Catching Freedom, but the Maryland Jockey Club did not include the fourth-place Derby finisher on its initial list of possible contenders, indicating that Cox is leaning against it.\n\nOther possible Preakness entrants include Seize the Grey, winner of the Pat Day Mile on the Derby undercard and trained by six-time Preakness winner D.

That's the pain of walking miles and miles around Churchill Downs over a week's time and it's incomparable to what the connections of Forever Young and Sierra Leone must feel after coming up inches short of winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nThe 150th running of the Kentucky Derby delivered in the best way possible. Patrons were welcomed to the racetrack with a beautiful spring day that didn't make men sweat through their tailored suits. Anticipation bubbled in the air throughout the day until the horses reached the starting gate for post time at the Kentucky Derby.\n\nBrian Hernandez guided Mystik Dan down the rail and the horse appeared to pull away down the stretch, but only for a moment. Forever Young and Sierra Leone were closing quickly, but could they catch him? The latter had enough in the tank, but couldn't stay in a straight line.\n\n\"I felt like I had plenty of horse,\" said Sierra Leone's rider, Tyler Gafflione. \"He wanted to lean in today and made it a little difficult. I had a hard time keeping him straight and that definitely cost us. He gives you everything, very responsive but he loses concentration.\"\n\nThat lean-in on Forever Young frustrated many of the Japanese horse's backers, who believed an inquiry could've moved him up to second. They weren't as gracious as Chad Brown, Sierra Leone's trainer who is still searching for his first Derby winner.\n\n\"You get beat a nose in the Kentucky Derby, it's a tough one,\" said Brown. \"But he's a tremendous horse, nearly undefeated. I'm just so lucky to have him, so proud of his effort today. He did what we asked him to do, just came up a little bit short.\"\n\nLife is a game of inches. Having grace after coming up inches short in an agonizing defeat is admirable.\n\nSomething unusual happened following the Kentucky Derby. A frequent flyer to the Infield on the biggest race day of the year, I'm familiar with the roars that follow the horses. For the first time, there was not a roar once the horses crossed the finish line.\n\nA quiet confusion filled the air. It was eerie.\n\nHours of build-up for the two-minute sprint ended dramatically with uncertainty. Nobody knew who won. Most in the crowd thought Mystik Dan held on, but no one holding a No. 3 ticket was willing to begin the celebration until a replay was shown. Even then, the response was tepid. Once the photo finish was revealed, my elated neighbor could finally exhale and enjoy a winning Pick 4 wager.\n\nThurby brought the heat, quite literally. A day after sweaty, long lines, patrons got cooled down by off-and-on rain on Oaks Day. It was welcomed with open arms. The poncho stayed packed away until the clouds began to roll in just after Thorpedo Anna crossed the finish line first. What followed was a Derby Week tradition, the post-race downpour.\n\nI've been stuck in plenty of those. The protocol is simple: hide under the tarp for a good old-fashioned tarp party. This was an extended one. After about 30 minutes, my friend told us to peek out underneath the tarp: we were the only people still in the middle of the Infield. My hat is still drying out from the deluge.\n\nSpeaking of hats, what once was excluded for Derby Day has now become a year-round trend. Yankee Doodle called it macaroni, but I'm not sure what the trendsetters are saying to describe wide-brimmed hats that are covered in different fabrics and feathers. One person I spotted at a post-Derby party had a used match tucked into the side of his hat and I don't think I've seen anything cooler in my life.\n\nThe new development in this year's fashion is the wife beater. Yes, the ribbed sleeveless shirt is back in style, but only if it's worn beneath a suit. It was all of the rage all Derby weekend among the racetrack's most stylish guests, a category which does not include myself.\n\nChurchill Downs track announcer Travis Stone is the best of the best. How can you tell? The key to the race was punctuated by Stone in real-time. \"Mystik Dan cut the corner!\" The drama could be felt through his voice until they reached the finish line. \"Here's the wire -- PHOTO FINISH -- three noses on the wire, Mystik Dan, Sierra Leone, and Forever Young in an International Thriller!\"\n\nThe world watched the finish in awe. On the same day NBC extended its contract with the first leg of the Triple Crown through 2032, the Kentucky Derby drew an average of 16.7 million viewers, the most since 1989. It peaked from 7-7:15 pm with 20.1 million viewers, the leargest peak audience ever for a Kentucky Derby on NBC.\n\nFriday afternoon I was devastated by a mistake. Three others trusted me to put together a Pick 5 ticket. We singled the opener and continued riding the good vibes until the last leg. In the final race a 20-1 Mike Maker horse crossed the finish line first. I was betting Mike Maker horses all day, surely I didn't throw it out on accident, right? Wrong.\n\nI kicked myself for making that costly $850 mistake until the American Turf. Graham Motion's turf horses always get at least a second look and on Kentucky Derby Day I was willing to wager a little extra on the long shot. Trikari finished first at 47-to-1. For the first time in a long time, I finished my week of wagering with more money in my pocket than when I started. It only takes one.\n\nThanks to everyone who tuned in for all of our coverage leading into the Kentucky Derby. The response from folks I saw last week was overwhelming. It's a grind, but it's all worth it. Thousands of folks checked out what a multitude of racing experts had to say about the race on the KSR YouTube Channel. They provided excellent insight, but none of them could replicate Kaitlin Free's performance. A frequent contributor on the big screen from the Paddock, in the interview below she basically described exactly how the race would unfold the day before it happened.

Maybe even more time since the milestone derby capped the best weekend of a jockey career spent mostly under the radar.\n\nThe Louisiana native rode Mystik Dan to an epic win at Churchill Downs, sliding past favorite Fierceness along the rail at the final turn and holding off Sierra Leone and Forever Young by a nose in an epic three-horse photo finish.\n\nHernandez was not even sure he had won until seeing the replay and keeping his eyes glued to the flat screen that showed the continuous loop.\n\n\"I'm like: 'Woo, I think we just won the Kentucky Derby,' but then those horses, they were so far out there, you couldn't really see them, and then they surged so quickly,\" the 38-year-old said. \"I was like: 'Oh man, I hope we won. I hope we won.' And then when they hung up our number, it was just instant relief.\"\n\nHernandez's derby victory aboard Mystik Dan at 18-1 odds came a day after he rode filly Thorpedo Anna to a wire-to-wire rout by four and three-quarter lengths in the 150th Kentucky Oaks.\n\nThat made him the first jockey to complete the Derby-Oaks double since Hall of Famer Calvin Borel achieved the feat in 2009 aboard Mine That Bird and filly Rachel Alexandra respectively. Kenny McPeek became the first trainer to earn the double since Ben Jones in 1952.\n\n\"We came into the weekend thinking we had really good chances both Friday and Saturday,\" Hernandez said. \"To have the horses pull it off for us, we really have to thank all the guys back in the barn.\"\n\n\"I don't know how long it's going to take to sink in. It's definitely a surreal moment,\" he added.\n\nHernandez's victory was fitting since he studied Borel's derby wins aboard Mine That Bird and Super Saver (2010), along with being around him during 20 years of racing in Kentucky.\n\nThose lessons paid off as he broke through after four derby finishes ranging from eighth to 12th, including 11th last May on Sun Thunder.\n\nHis seminal moment should not have been shocking considering Hernandez already had an Eclipse Award to his name as top apprentice rider in 2004 along with a Breeders' Cup Classic win in 2012 with Fort Larned. He was also third in the Preakness two years ago with Creative Minister and has a slew of graded stakes wins.\n\nWinning the Kentucky Derby brings a whole different type of recognition, along with a sparkling title that will precede Hernandez for the rest of his life.\n\nMcPeek said immediately afterward that the rider can no longer be considered underrated after a \"brilliant\" ride, and called the gutsy inside path taken to victory typical for the jockey.\n\n\"He knows what to do there,\" McPeek said. \"I always had a world of confidence in him. Rarely second-guess anything he does.\"", "source": {"uri": "taipeitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Taipei Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_A._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben A.

Finally, Japan's T O Freedom takes home $150,000 after finishing fifth.\n\nIt remains to be seen how long Mystik Dan's connections want to keep the horse racing. Once they decide whether to pursue the Triple Crown and race him at Pimlico, they may have to make the business decision whether to keep racing him or put him out to stud.\n\nThe real earning potential in a race horse isn't in the races they compete in, but in post-racing stud fees, which can go into the hundreds of thousands if they start producing race winners.\n\nWill Mystik Dan keep winning?", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tzvi_machlin@postandcourier.com", "name": "Tzvi Machlin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimlico_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pimlico Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stud_(animal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stud (animal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/fe/afeaf909-3749-58f9-aba3-58b62c6f6e51/6637011010b18.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539947", "eventUri": "eng-9539947", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

The Super Bowl. A lot of people don't even watch the NFL until you get to the Super Bowl. Golf. Many people don't pay attention to golf until you get to the Masters or the U.S. Open. A lot of people don't watch NCAA basketball until you get to the NCAA Tournament. The same applies to the Kentucky Derby.\"\n\nThe Kentucky Derby was officially a sell out of course. Back when tickets were available, standing-room general admission tickets had a starting price of $275. A private suite would run you $135,000 to reserve to watch the Run for the Roses.\n\nIf you wanted to have a seat at Churchill Downs, well, those were priced at a minimum of $650.

(AP) -- Mystik Dan won the 150th Kentucky Derby in a dramatic three-horse photo finish, edging out Sierra Leone and Forever Young for the upset victory. It was the 10th Derby to be decided by a nose, the closest margin in horse racing. Sent off at 18-1 odds, Mystik Dan and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. rode the rail down the stretch with a short lead. Sierra Leone and Forever Young from Japan gave chase and pressured the leader to the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs on Saturday. Hernandez and trainer Kenny McPeek had teamed to win the Kentucky Oaks for fillies a day earlier with Thorpedo Anna. Mystik Dan ran 1 1/4 miles in 2:03.34 and paid $39.22 to win.\n\nKentucky Derby victory aboard Mystik Dan provides signature win for jockey Brian Hernandez Jr.\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. rode Mystik Dan to victory in the 150th Kentucky Derby to complete the most rewarding weekend of his career. The Eclipse Award winner and Breeders' Cup champion won the milestone derby a day after guiding filly Thorpedo Anna to a wire-to-wire victory by 4 3/4 lengths in the Kentucky Oaks. He became the first jockey to complete the Derby/Oaks double since Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009, fitting considering Hernandez studied Borel's derby wins and spent time with him in his Kentucky racing career. And, he's no longer under the radar as a jockey.\n\nEdwards scores 43 points, Reid erupts in 4th to help Timberwolves beat Nuggets 106-99 in Game 1\n\nDENVER (AP) -- Anthony Edwards scored a playoff career-high 43 points, Naz Reid had 14 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter and the Minnesota Timberwolves beat the defending NBA champion Denver Nuggets 106-99 in Game 1 of the second-round series Saturday night. Edwards was unstoppable in the first half, scoring 25 points, and Reid took over in the fourth quarter. Game 2 is Monday night in Denver. Three days after undergoing knee surgery, Timberwolves coach Chris Finch was on the bench in the second row, next to the scorer's table and behind assistant coach Micah Nori, who did the instructing, roaming and switching. Two-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic had 32 points, eight rebounds and nine assists for Denver.\n\nMessi has a record-setting game with a goal and 5 assists in Inter Miami's 6-2 win over Red Bulls\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Lionel Messi set three MLS records with a goal and five assists as Inter Miami trounced the New York Red Bulls 6-2. His six goal contributions, five assists and five assists in a half were all league records. Fresh after earning MLS Player of the Month Award for April, Messi has scored and assisted in six consecutive league matches. Luis Su\u00e1rez had three goals and Matias Rojas scored twice as Inter Miami scored six unanswered goals to come from a 1-0 deficit at halftime. Inter Miami remains atop the Eastern Conference with 24 points. Dante Vanzeir gave New York the first-half lead. The Red Bulls dropped to 4-2-5.\n\nTaylor Pendrith leads Byron Nelson as one of several seeking first PGA Tour victory\n\nMcKINNEY, Texas (AP) -- Taylor Pendrith has a one-shot lead going into the final round of the CJ Cup Byron Nelson. The Canadian is among several leaders seeking his first PGA Tour victory. Pendrith chipped in twice for consecutive eagles to kick-start his round of 8-under 63. It's the third time for back-to-back eagles on tour this season. Pendrith is at 19 under, one shot ahead of second-round leader Jake Knapp. First-round leader Matt Wallace is another shot back in a tie with Ben Kohles.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nYankees slugger Aaron Judge ejected for first time in his career\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge was ejected for the first time in his career when he argued a called third strike by plate umpire Ryan Blakney in the seventh inning of Saturday's game against the Detroit Tigers. With one out, Judge took a full count fastball from Tyler Holton that he thought was slightly outside. Blakney rang him up, Judge glanced back and was ejected. After starting to walk back to the dugout, Judge returned to argue the call and manager Aaron Boone continued the argument.\n\nHaaland scores 4 in another win for Man City. Arsenal isn't going away in the title race, though\n\nErling Haaland scored four goals in another win for Manchester City in its bid to capture an unprecedented fourth straight Premier League crown. Yet Arsenal isn't going away in this title race. Haaland has now at least a hat trick in six of his 63 matches in England's top flight after converting two penalties, powering in a header and curling home a sublime finish in City's 5-1 victory over Wolverhampton. It was a response to Arsenal's 3-0 win over Bournemouth a few hours earlier. Arsenal retained its one-point lead over City but the defending champions have three games left. That's one more than Arsenal. Burnley slipped closer to relegation with a 4-1 loss to Newcastle.\n\nReal Madrid wins its record-extending 36th Spanish league title after Barcelona loses at Girona\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Real Madrid has won its record-extending 36th Spanish league title after securing an insurmountable 13-point lead over second-place Girona with four games remaining. Madrid reclaimed the domestic crown after beating Cadiz 3-0 earlier Saturday and Barcelona then lost 4-2 at Girona. Only a victory by Barcelona would have stopped Madrid from celebrating. Girona leapfrogged Barcelona and pushed its Catalan rival into third place at 14 points behind Madrid. Madrid hosts Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday with their semifinal evenly balanced after a 2-2 first-leg draw in Germany.\n\nCavaliers and Magic to settle playoff series standoff with Game 7 -- the 'best two words in sports'\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cavs and Magic are going to the limit. Unable to find a way to win on the road, Cleveland and Orlando will settle their series on Sunday with a Game 7, a fitting conclusion between two teams that have put their strengths and weaknesses on public display for six games. Only one advances to face the Boston Celtics, who will be well-rested for whichever team escapes this stalemate. The Magic forced Game 7 with a 103-96 at home on Friday night by withstanding a 50-point performance from Cleveland guard Donovan Mitchell.\n\nMax Verstappen ties Alain Prost's record with 6th pole-winning run to open an F1 season\n\nMIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) -- Max Verstappen inched closer to a third consecutive win at the Miami Grand Prix on Saturday by continuing his long domination of Formula 1 qualifying. The three-time reigning F1 champion won his seventh consecutive pole, but first at Miami, where Verstappen failed to earn the top starting spot in the first two races around Hard Rock Stadium, yet still won them both. The pole-winning run tied Verstappen with Alain Prost in opening the season with six consecutive poles. Prost did it in 1993. Verstappen opened Saturday with a win in the sprint race and ended the day with his 38th career pole. The Red Bull driver beat the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz Jr. and will lead the field to green on Sunday for the first of F1's three races this year in the United States.", "source":

Two years ago, Woodford County's Eric Reed, the trainer of an even bigger longshot Derby winner, chose to keep Rich Strike out of the Preakness Stakes. Reed said McPeek will make sure the Derby didn't take too much out of Mystik Dan.\n\n\"These decisions are tough, because you've got a lot of fallout from the press, and the media and political stuff, you know, history. But Kenny knows, he knows how to handle that situation. And guarantee, whatever decision he makes will be the right one for that horse.\"\n\nReed said Richie, as he was known around the farm, needed longer to recover, mentally, and ran a different type of race.\n\n\"He was a deep closer, and Pimlico was for horses that can be up near the pace, they have to have some some tactical early speed.

Gasaway, who was clearly overcome with emotion at the time, could only respond with a \"we'll discuss it.\"\n\nThis shouldn't be too hard of a decision for Mystik Dan's but it has proven to be so for a number of Kentucky Derby winners in recent years. 2022 Kentucky Derby winner Rich Strike and 2019 Kentucky Derby winner Country House were both pulled from the ensuing Preakness Stakes race due to health reasons.\n\nLast year's Derby winner, Mage, finished third.\n\nThe final decision will most likely be made by Mystik Dan's trainer, Kenneth McPeek. This was McPeek's first win in the Run for the Roses so the opportunity to make history has to be appealing at a certain level. He knows Pimlico well, having trained Swiss Skydiver to victory in the 2020 Preakness Stakes.\n\nBut the Preakness is just two weeks away and one of the reasons that only three horses in the last 10 years have won both is that fresh horses who just missed qualifying for the Kentucky Derby will be allowed to compete.\n\nLest we forget, two-time Triple Crown winner Bob Baffert was not able to enter any of his horses into the Derby this year and he's got a stable full of contenders who are probably eager to steal a Triple Crown bid from Mystik Dan's connections.\n\nWill Mystik Dan make the trip to Pimlico?

On November 29, 2003, in Louisiana's Delta Downs, he won his first race as a professional in 2003.\n\nHis height stands at 5 feet 11 inches and he weighs 86 kg.\n\nThe American Eclipse Award-winning jockey in Thoroughbred horse racing rode his first winning horse at Delta Downs in Vinton, Louisiana, in 2003. Three years later, in the 2006 Indiana Derby (G2), the rookie jockey rode Cielo Gold to victory, marking the first of his 51 career graded stakes wins.\n\nBrian got exposed to riding ever since he was born. In southern Louisiana, racing has traditionally been a family affair. But the Hernandez family, who ride, has taken it to a whole new level. He was born into a family of riders. His father and brothers all are riders.\n\nThe pinnacle of Hernandez's career came with his Breeders' Cup Classic triumph in 2012 with Ian Wilkes's Fort Larned. His most well-known accomplishment was working with Girvin, who for trainer Joe Sharp won the 2017 Louisiana Derby (G2) and Risen Star (G2).\n\nThe first Hernandez child to carry on his father's legacy was Brian Jr. Having gone by \"B.J.\" since childhood and now has surpassed his father in notoriety. He won the Eclipse Award in 2004 for being the top apprentice, and he with Fort Larned won the Breeders' Cup Classic in 2012. With 1,224 career wins, he is now chasing close on his father's record.\n\nHe won the Kentucky Derby in 2024 while riding Mystik Dan, with guidance from Kenny McPeek. Riding Thorpedo Anna, McPeek's other horse, he had won the Kentucky Oaks the day before.\n\nHis major racing wins are Kentucky Derby (2024), Kentucky Oaks (2024), Louisiana Handicap (2004), Remington Springboard Mile Stakes (2004), Indiana Derby (2006, 2012), Edgewood Stakes (2007), Ack Ack Handicap (2012), Cornhusker Handicap (2012), Indiana Derby (2012), Indiana Oaks (2012, 2023), Whitney Handicap (2012), Beaumont Stakes (2013), Illinois Derby (2013), Opening Verse Stakes (2016, 2020). In the American Classics/Breeders' Cup wins, he clinched Kentucky Derby (2024) and Breeders' Cup Classic (2012).\n\nBrian \"B.J.\" Hernandez Jr's father was Brian Hernandez Sr, a former jockey.

Absolutely the f**k not.\n\nA man whose name I regretfully don't know, nor can I unearth it on the Twittersphere despite my best on-the-fly efforts, stole the show and some of the thunder from Mystik Dan's thrilling victory by a nose over Sierra Leone and Forever Young.\n\nHad to show the proper race before the reveal of this man. You wouldn't be prepared for the drop right away. Even before the race, folks were wondering just who the hell this guy was.\n\nAgain, man is a mystery and I don't mean any disrespect if he's, like, part of the training crew or something. All I know is, he was right next to Mystik Dan trainer Kenny McPeek for his interviews afterwards. Poor Go Long NFL writer Tyler Dunne -- news breaker of the Sean McDermott 9/11 speech -- called his shot that Mystik Dan would emerge victorious by force of sheer proximity to Mr. Stars and Stripes. Just couldn't pull the trigger on the winning bet slip in time.\n\nIt is painfully obvious that Captain America -- is that nickname too on the nose? Will workshop as I go here -- was fiercely dedicated to the Mystik Dan cause. That man's face was straight-up scalded by the sun.\n\nThe main takeaway from the Kentucky Derby and from this article is as follows. You can't tell me Mr. Stars and Stripes -- better moniker, that -- isn't personally responsible for the extra mojo Mystik Dan needed to edge out the competition at the finish line. Nor can you convince me that the strength of his charisma and the wattage of his general aura didn't spark such epic breakthroughs for McPeek and veteran jockey Brian Hernandez.\n\nDon't even need to look at Mystik Dan's pedigree. It's irrelevant. Mr. Stars and Stripes was and is the X-factor. You really want to bet against Mystik Dan at the Preakness with all this as context? Be my guest. I know who I'm tailing at the next Triple Crown race -- and it ain't because I'm hoping for Mystik Dan to achieve horse racing's most coveted trifecta of wins. It's because Mr. Stars and Stripes will not be denied.\n\nPledge your allegiance to Mr. Stars and Stripes. He is an instant legend.

With the Derby completed, the field for the 149th Preakness Stakes (G1) at Pimlico Race Course May 18 is beginning to take shape but will likely be missing much Derby influence.\n\nKentucky Derby-winning trainer Kenny McPeek had not yet completed his morning after Derby interview with the media May 5 before receiving a call from Pimlico officially inviting Mystik Dan to the Preakness. However, whether or not the Kentucky Derby winner participates is still yet to be determined.\n\n\"I'm undecided on Baltimore, we'll see,\" said McPeek.\n\nMcPeek said the Goldencents colt was tired following his gutsy performance in which he held off Blue Grass Stakes (G1) winner Sierra Leone by a nose. McPeek plans to send the Derby winner back to the track May 8, and will determine from there his status on the Preakness.\n\n\"If I don't think he's right and ready, then we'll just wait for the Belmont,\" McPeek said.\n\nSign up for BloodHorse Daily\n\nThe June 8 Belmont Stakes (G1) appears to be the most likely landing spot for many of the Derby contenders. With the race temporarily moving from Belmont Park to Saratoga Race Course due to Belmont Park reconstruction, the typical 1 1/2-mile distance will be reduced to the same 1 1/4 miles of the Derby. Saratoga's main-track track configuration necessitates the change.\n\n\"I think that distance at Saratoga is a great race,\" McPeek said. \"I actually like it better at a mile and a quarter than a mile and a half.\"\n\nMcPeek himself will head to Saratoga this week to begin prepping his barn for the summer.\n\n\"Better-than-average chance we're going to send him and some others straight to Saratoga,\" he added.\n\nOne of the weighing factors for McPeek could be that when Mystik Dan broke his maiden at Churchill Downs Nov. 12, he ran a flat fifth in allowance company just 13 days later. The two-week turn-around could be too quick for Mystik Dan, but McPeek also noted that things could be different this time as a 3-year-old.\n\n\"Horses sometimes pop back quickly, sometimes they don't,\" McPeek said. \"We'll just have to take that as it comes; it's too early to tell.\"\n\nMcPeek trains Mystik Dan for owners Lance Gasaway, 4 G Racing, Daniel Hamby III, and Valley View Farm.\n\nShould Mystik Dan compete in the Preakness, he will likely not see any of the horses who surrounded him at the end of the Derby.\n\nChad Brown, fresh off a heartbreaking defeat as Sierra Leone came up inches short of Derby glory, made it clear Sunday morning that the Belmont will be the son of Gun Runner 's next start.\n\n\"He's not going to the Preakness,\" Brown said. \"I'm going to take him to Saratoga tomorrow and he's going to train up there for the Belmont.\"\n\nSierra Leone will not be the only Derby horse whose connections are opting to skip the Preakness in favor of the Belmont. Connections for both Honor Marie and West Saratoga confirmed that the Belmont is currently their next target.\n\nThird-place finisher Forever Young and fifth-place finisher T O Password will both bypass the remainder of the Triple Crown. They are scheduled to fly back to Japan early this week.\n\nBrad Cox confirmed fourth-place finisher Catching Freedom is not under consideration for the Preakness. Bill Mott said sixth-place finisher Resilience , who made a threatening move on the far turn before flattening out in the stretch, will not go forward with the Triple Crown, alluding to shorter races being in the colt's future.\n\nLast year, Kentucky Derby winner Mage was the lone Derby starter to participate in the Preakness. It appears that 2024 could follow a similar story.\n\nNew Shooters\n\nWith many Derby contenders likely to skip the Preakness, this opens the door for new shooters looking to earn a victory in one of America's classics.\n\nZedan Racing Stable's two-time grade 1 winner Muth is one of the few horses with a confirmed bullseye drawn on the Preakness gate. Trained by Bob Baffert, the Arkansas Derby (G1) winner was not eligible to start in the Kentucky Derby due to Baffert's suspension from Churchill Downs following a failed drug test that disqualified Medina Spirit 's victory in the 2021 Kentucky Derby.\n\nIn the Arkansas Derby, Muth defeated Mystik Dan by 6 1/4 lengths. Even if Mystik Dan returns for the Preakness, it is likely that Muth will be the favorite for the Triple Crown's middle jewel.\n\nBaffert is also preparing San Felipe Stakes (G2) winner and Santa Anita Derby (G1) runner-up Imagination for the Preakness. That colt races for the partnership of SF Racing, Starlight Racing, Madaket Stables, Stonestreet Stables, Dianne Bashor, Bob Masterson, Waves Edge Capital, Catherine Donovan, and Tom Ryan.\n\nThe Baffert duo worked together at Santa Anita Park May 4, breezing a bullet six furlongs in 1:11 2/5.\n\nBrown-trained Tuscan Gold , third in the Louisiana Derby (G2), is under consideration for the Preakness. However, Brown plans to enter the son of Medaglia d'Oro in the May 11 Peter Pan Stakes (G3) at Aqueduct Racetrack.\n\n\"See how (the Peter Pan) comes up,\" Brown said about his decision between the two races. \"Where he draws -- it's likely to be a big field from what I'm hearing -- weather, keep an eye on (who's going to the) Preakness. Go from there.\"\n\nSeveral horses have earned automatic-berth victories in prep races for the Preakness and could be possibilities for the race in Baltimore, Md.\n\nFour-time stakes winner Copper Tax earned an automatic berth to the Preakness with his victory in the April 20 Federico Tesio Stakes at Laurel Park. Since his victory, the son of Copper Bullet has yet to record a published workout for trainer Gary Capuano.\n\nAlso on April 20, Informed Patriot earned a Preakness berth after victory in the Bathhouse Row Stakes at Oaklawn Park. The Hard Spun colt worked a half-mile in :52 for trainer Steve Asmussen Sunday at Oaklawn Park.\n\nPatriot Spirit earned a $20,000 credit toward Preakness entry fees after winning the April 21 Illinois Derby at Hawthorne Race Course but he is not Triple Crown nominated. It costs $150,000 to supplement a horse to the 1 3/16-mile, $2 million Preakness", "source": {"uri": "bloodhorse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blood Horse Interactive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_collins@bloodhorse.com", "name": "Sean Collins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimlico_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pimlico Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Group One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Baffert", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bob Baffert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldencents", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goldencents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Grass_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue Grass Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_H._Cox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad H.

(AP) -- Mystik Dan won the 150th Kentucky Derby in a dramatic three-horse photo finish, edging out Sierra Leone and Forever Young for the upset victory. It was the 10th Derby to be decided by a nose, the closest margin in horse racing. Sent off at 18-1 odds, Mystik Dan and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. rode the rail down the stretch with a short lead. Sierra Leone and Forever Young from Japan gave chase and pressured the leader to the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs on Saturday. Hernandez and trainer Kenny McPeek had teamed to win the Kentucky Oaks for fillies a day earlier with Thorpedo Anna. Mystik Dan ran 1 1/4 miles in 2:03.34 and paid $39.22 to win.\n\nKentucky Derby victory aboard Mystik Dan provides signature win for jockey Brian Hernandez Jr.\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. rode Mystik Dan to victory in the 150th Kentucky Derby to complete the most rewarding weekend of his career. The Eclipse Award winner and Breeders' Cup champion won the milestone derby a day after guiding filly Thorpedo Anna to a wire-to-wire victory by 4 3/4 lengths in the Kentucky Oaks. He became the first jockey to complete the Derby/Oaks double since Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009, fitting considering Hernandez studied Borel's derby wins and spent time with him in his Kentucky racing career. And, he's no longer under the radar as a jockey.\n\nEdwards scores 43 points, Reid erupts in 4th to help Timberwolves beat Nuggets 106-99 in Game 1\n\nDENVER (AP) -- Anthony Edwards scored a playoff career-high 43 points, Naz Reid had 14 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter and the Minnesota Timberwolves beat the defending NBA champion Denver Nuggets 106-99 in Game 1 of the second-round series Saturday night. Edwards was unstoppable in the first half, scoring 25 points, and Reid took over in the fourth quarter. Game 2 is Monday night in Denver. Three days after undergoing knee surgery, Timberwolves coach Chris Finch was on the bench in the second row, next to the scorer's table and behind assistant coach Micah Nori, who did the instructing, roaming and switching. Two-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic had 32 points, eight rebounds and nine assists for Denver.\n\nDavid Pastrnak scores in overtime to lift Bruins to Game 7 win over rival Maple Leafs\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- David Pastrnak scored on a feed from Hampus Lindholm 1:54 into overtime and the Boston Bruins beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 2-1 in Game 7 to clinch their first-round series and advance in the NHL playoffs. Jeremy Swayman finished with 30 saves and Lindholm had the tying goal in regulation to help the Bruins avoid losing their second straight first-round series after holding a 3-1 lead. They have now defeated the rival Maple Leafs in Game 7 of the first round of the playoffs three times in the last seven years. Boston will meet the Florida Panthers, who upset the Bruins in seven games in the first round last year.\n\nMessi has a record-setting game with a goal and 5 assists in Inter Miami's 6-2 win over Red Bulls\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Lionel Messi set three MLS records with a goal and five assists as Inter Miami trounced the New York Red Bulls 6-2. His six goal contributions, five assists and five assists in a half were all league records. Fresh after earning MLS Player of the Month Award for April, Messi has scored and assisted in six consecutive league matches. Luis Su\u00e1rez had three goals and Matias Rojas scored twice as Inter Miami scored six unanswered goals to come back from a 1-0 halftime deficit. Inter Miami remains atop the Eastern Conference with 24 points. Dante Vanzeir gave New York the first-half lead. The Red Bulls dropped to 4-2-5.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nTaylor Pendrith leads Byron Nelson as one of several seeking first PGA Tour victory\n\nMcKINNEY, Texas (AP) -- Taylor Pendrith has a one-shot lead going into the final round of the CJ Cup Byron Nelson. The Canadian is among several leaders seeking his first PGA Tour victory. Pendrith chipped in twice for consecutive eagles to kick-start his round of 8-under 63. It's the third time for back-to-back eagles on tour this season. Pendrith is at 19 under, one shot ahead of second-round leader Jake Knapp. First-round leader Matt Wallace is another shot back in a tie with Ben Kohles.\n\nYankees slugger Aaron Judge ejected for first time in his career\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge was ejected for the first time in his career when he argued a called third strike by plate umpire Ryan Blakney in the seventh inning of Saturday's game against the Detroit Tigers. With one out, Judge took a full count fastball from Tyler Holton that he thought was slightly outside. Blakney rang him up, Judge glanced back and was ejected. After starting to walk back to the dugout, Judge returned to argue the call and manager Aaron Boone continued the argument.\n\nHaaland scores 4 in another win for Man City. Arsenal isn't going away in the title race, though\n\nErling Haaland scored four goals in another win for Manchester City in its bid to capture an unprecedented fourth straight Premier League crown. Yet Arsenal isn't going away in this title race. Haaland has now at least a hat trick in six of his 63 matches in England's top flight after converting two penalties, powering in a header and curling home a sublime finish in City's 5-1 victory over Wolverhampton. It was a response to Arsenal's 3-0 win over Bournemouth a few hours earlier. Arsenal retained its one-point lead over City but the defending champions have three games left. That's one more than Arsenal. Burnley slipped closer to relegation with a 4-1 loss to Newcastle.\n\nReal Madrid wins its record-extending 36th Spanish league title after Barcelona loses at Girona\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Real Madrid has won its record-extending 36th Spanish league title after securing an insurmountable 13-point lead over second-place Girona with four games remaining. Madrid reclaimed the domestic crown after beating Cadiz 3-0 earlier Saturday and Barcelona then lost 4-2 at Girona. Only a victory by Barcelona would have stopped Madrid from celebrating. Girona leapfrogged Barcelona and pushed its Catalan rival into third place at 14 points behind Madrid. Madrid hosts Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday with their semifinal evenly balanced after a 2-2 first-leg draw in Germany.\n\nCavaliers and Magic to settle playoff series standoff with Game 7 -- the 'best two words in sports'\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cavs and Magic are going to the limit. Unable to find a way to win on the road, Cleveland and Orlando will settle their series on Sunday with a Game 7, a fitting conclusion between two teams that have put their strengths and weaknesses on public display for six games. Only one advances to face the Boston Celtics, who will be well-rested for whichever team escapes this stalemate. The Magic forced Game 7 with a 103-96 at home on Friday night by withstanding a 50-point performance from Cleveland guard Donovan Mitchell.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news",

HISA CEO Lisa Lazarus told LPM this week that the horses have been repeatedly tested.\n\n\"If they're running in the Derby, it means they have not had an issue with our program,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_bowman@npr.org", "name": "Emma Bowman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Gaffalione", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Gaffalione"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thoroughbred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jockey Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_affiliate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Network affiliate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Fairs_and_Expos", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Fairs and Expos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Barrel_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Barrel Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2024/05/04/ap24125836041901_wide-e595b7568370b94eb4dca81c15c6321b37b25178.jpg?s=1400&c=100&f=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539947", "eventUri": "eng-9539947", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Trainer Kenny McPeek and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. are partners in peaceful coexistence.\n\nNo stress. No tension. \"No drama,\" McPeek says, repeatedly.\n\nHe said it May 3 after Hernandez rode Thorpedo Anna to the trainer's first victory in the Kentucky Oaks (G1), and he reiterated the sentiment May 4 after Hernandez beat Sierra Leone by Mystik Dan 's nose to win the Kentucky Derby (G1).\n\nNo trainer had completed the Oaks/Derby double since Ben Jones did it in 1952, and few trainers have developed so strong a bond with their first-call rider than the one McPeek has forged with Hernandez. Where others clash, they coordinate. Listen to them long enough and you're sure to hear an echo.\n\n\"He entrusted me and lets me kind of go out there and do things and not tie my hands to force horses to do things they might not like to do,\" Hernandez said. \"I think my riding style fits with his training style, as well, where we let the horses develop and let them take you around there and try to find the trip with them.\n\nSign up for BloodHorse Daily\n\n\"It's just been a great relationship, and I have been fortunate enough to fall into a good spot.\"\n\nMcPeek's methodology is somewhat unusual for top-tier trainers. Openly unconcerned with his winning percentage, he prefers to play the long game, letting his horses \"learn some lessons,\" even when that means courting adversity and losing races.\n\n\"We tend to -- I'm almost going to say 'schooling race' the first time out, which usually hurts our percentage,\" McPeek said Saturday. \"And Brian's familiar with that process every time. We try to teach horses to take a little dirt in their face. This colt (Mystik Dan), he had some schooling in his first start. He could have won first time out if you wanted him to, but he wouldn't have learned anything.\"\n\nHernandez embraced McPeek's philosophy early in their relationship and rapidly earned his trust. Saturday's Derby 150 was McPeek's 10th Run for the Roses and Hernandez has ridden for the trainer the past three years he's had horses in the race. He is the only rider McPeek has used more than once in the country's most famous race. When the two men are finished celebrating their wondrous weekend, Hernandez is scheduled to ride all three of McPeek's entries on Thursday's card at Churchill Downs -- two claiming races and a starter allowance.\n\n\"Frank Bernis is Brian's agent and there's nothing complicated about either one of them,\" McPeek said. \"It's all business, business, business and there's no drama. And I like no drama, especially the older I get.\n\n\"I want to know that somebody is there; that you don't have to beg them to come. You don't have to worry about them not showing up, conflicts and things like that. But more than anything, I put Brian on horses on a daily basis -- good horses and average horses -- and he does a good job on every one of them. I have rarely come back and said, 'That was horrible.' No, I don't have that.\"\n\nWhat he has is a jockey as steady as a metronome. Riding primarily for McPeek, Hernandez has exceeded $10 million in earnings three years in a row and now ranks fourth in 2024 earnings after his back-to-back breakthroughs at Churchill Downs.\n\n\"I have just been very fortunate,\" Hernandez said. \"Like Kenny said, a big part of this goes back to my agent, Frank. We got together 12 years ago and we were -- at the time, we were both kind of struggling, just kind of making ends meet. We made a pretty good career for the last seven, eight years riding for Kenny.\n\n\". . .We have learned the program. With the first-timers and the horses like that, we know they don't need to win the first time out. If they are really, really good, they will overcome just the little things, that they will get in trouble and stuff like that and they will be able to overcome it.\"\n\nSaturday, Hernandez followed a formula made famous by three-time Derby winner Calvin Borel, who was the seventh and most recent rider to sweep the Oaks and Derby in 2009. Clinging close to the inside rail to save ground, Hernandez had paint on his boot by the end of the race according to McPeek. Given his miniscule margin of victory, every inch he saved proved to be crucial.\n\n\"I had no doubt that he was going to get him around there in perfect order,\" McPeek said. \"He's the difference in winning and losing today, for sure.\"\n\nHe is McPeek's go-to guy pretty much everywhere he goes.\n\n\"Maybe I will go to Saratoga and I will ride some other riders and go, 'Boy, I miss Brian. I miss Brian,' because he doesn't make very many mistakes. And I don't want you to write that at all. I don't want anybody to know how good Brian is.\"\n\nAt this point, McPeek paused to allow for laughter.\n\n\"But I guess the cat's out of the bag, isn't it?\" he said.\n\nTrue, that.", "source": {"uri": "bloodhorse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blood Horse Interactive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Oaks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Oaks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Group One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_A._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben A.

Kenny McPeek, trainer of the Kentucky Derby winner, said Sunday morning that he has not committed to going to Baltimore to race May 18 after the horse seemed a little off after Saturday's victory.\n\n\"We're not committed to the Preakness,\" McPeek said. \"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me.\"\n\nOne thing that trainers use to gauge a horse's fitness is how they eat. In short, an empty feed bucket means a happy horse.\n\n\"Most trainers don't talk about all this,\" McPeek said. \"Look, cards on the table, face up. He left three-quarters of his feed. We couldn't hardly get everybody out of the barn until midnight, so he didn't really get a great night's rest. We'll watch him today and tomorrow.\"\n\nAt this point it is closer to a coin flip more than anything else if Mystik Dan will run in the Preakness. There is no need to take any chances with a colt whose breeding value jumped exponentially after winning the Kentucky Derby by the slimmest of noses.\n\n\"The back story on that [two-week reference] is that I ran the colt back too quick in November,\" McPeek said on Saturday night before knowing about Sunday's development. \"He won really easy in his maiden race and I wanted to stretch him out and it was the end of the season.\n\n\"I ran him back in an allowance race going a mile and he coughed up a lung infection on me. Learned a little lesson there with him. I feel if a horse is doing good and we can win a race, let's give it a run. That one backfired.\"\n\nMcPeek said a decision might not be made until next Monday when entries are taken for the Preakness. It's not unusual for a horse to be shipped to Baltimore on the Wednesday before the race.\n\n\"We're going to have a lot of input,\" co-owner Lance Gasaway told Horse Racing Nation. \"It's all about the horse. Let's see how the horse comes out of the race. Give him two or three days. If he comes out good, we'll look at it. If not, we'll worry about the horse more than anything.\"\n\nIf he doesn't go, it will spoil his rematch with Muth. Mystik Dan finished third in the Arkansas Derby while Muth won it. But Muth was not eligible to run in the Kentucky Derby because he is trained by Bob Baffert, who is in the third year of a ban that was originally set at two years. Churchill Downs barred him from its properties after Medina Spirit tested positive for a legal medication that is banned on race day after winning the 2021 Derby. Baffert has had no horses fail a test since then.\n\nBaffert is expected to also enter Imagination, who finished second in the Santa Anita Derby to Stronghold, who finished seventh in the Derby. Baffert has won the Preakness eight times, including last year with National Treasure.\n\nIf Mystik Dan does not go to Baltimore it would heighten the conversation about the relevance of the Preakness Stakes at a time that most horses don't come back on two weeks' rest. The Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita Park, just turned over Pimlico Race Course to the state of Maryland but still retains the intellectual properties of the Preakness Stakes.\n\nAidan Butler, chief executive of its racing division, has been floating ideas that the Triple Crown should be retooled with each race held a month apart rather than two weeks from the Derby to the Preakness and three weeks from the Preakness to the Belmont. This could certainly bolster his argument.\n\nThere is no doubt that current training patterns do not favor a two-week turnaround. Last year there was only one Derby horse that ran in the Preakness, the only one that mattered, Derby winner Mage. The previous year, Rich Strike skipped the Preakness. In 2021, Medina Spirit ran in the Preakness and finished third. The Derby result was overturned and Mandaloun was declared the winner, so technically the Derby winner was not in the race.\n\nIn 2020, the COVID year, the Preakness was held in October and the Derby winner, Authentic, was in the race. The Derby was run in September.\n\nA survey of most of the other trainers by Churchill Downs media relations could not find any takers ready to go to Baltimore. The jockey for T O Password, Kazishi Kimura, indicated on Saturday that he thought the horse could go to the Preakness. But the people who pay the bills have him headed back to Japan.\n\n\"He's good this morning, no problems but he is tired,\" Kimura said. \"It is what it is. He missed the first step and from there I followed Sierra Leone. He tried hard all the way.\"\n\nThe second-place finisher, Sierra Leone, will be skipping the Preakness.\n\n\"He's good, but he's not going to the Preakness,\" trainer Chad Brown said. \"I'm going to take him to Saratoga tomorrow and he's going to train there for the Belmont [Stakes]. He's a little tired. He's a real laid back horse but when we brought him out, he was a little more tired than he normally is after his races. I think giving him the five weeks to the Belmont is definitely the right thing to do.\"\n\nRegardless if Mystik Dan runs in two weeks, he'll also be headed back to Saratoga, where McPeek has a home.\n\nMcPeek now has a career Triple Crown having won the Preakness in 2020 with Swiss Skydiver and the Belmont in 2002 with Sarava at 70-1 odds.\n\nWill McPeek now start to get doubles on his career Triple Crown? The thinking is the answer lies in the feed bucket.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Baffert", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bob Baffert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiden_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maiden race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Treasure_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Treasure (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina_Spirit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medina Spirit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Anita_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santa Anita Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Strike", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rich Strike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mage_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mage (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Skydiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swiss Skydiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandaloun_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mandaloun (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarava", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sarava"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Brown_(horse_trainer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chad Brown (horse trainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimlico_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pimlico Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Barrel_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Barrel Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3b197a1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3940x2216+0+205/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb0%2F3b%2F76a9e00749af81e88fff0a27ce93%2Fkentucky-derby-horse-racing-22884.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539947", "eventUri": "eng-9539947", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "textStart": 220, "textEnd": 226}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

The Preakness, the second leg of the Triple Crown, will be run on Saturday, May 18, at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nNo. 3 Mystik Dan closed at 18-to-1 odds to win the Derby. The Kenny McPeek-trained colt, ridden by Brian Hernandez Jr., held off No. 2 Sierra Leone (9-2) and Forever Young (6-1) to finish first in the Run for the Roses.\n\nMystik Dan's odds to win the Triple Crown were about 155-1 on some betting sites heading into the Derby.\n\nThe odds for any horse to win the Triple Crown in 2024 were +675 ahead of the Derby, with the \"no\" priced at -990.\n\nA Kentucky Derby winner's path to a Preakness victory is typically less resistant than the one he faced at Churchill Downs. While the Derby is intended to feature the world's 20 best three-year-old thoroughbreds, several of these horses will pass on the trip to Pimilco after losing at Churchill. The Preakness field is often filled with \"new shooters\", runners who did not compete (read: didn't qualify) for the Derby.\n\nThings tend to get more difficult for a Triple Crown hopeful in the Belmont Stakes, run at the unusually long distance of a mile-and-a-half to conclude a grueling five-week stretch for the young animal. Some contenders who lost to Mystic Dan in the Derby will decide to skip the Preakness but figure to be back in action in New York on June 8.\n\nThe Derby winner typically goes into the Preakness as the favorite, but Mystik Dan's Derby odds were pretty long, so we'll have to see how the field shapes up and how much respect his win in Churchill garners.\n\nHere are Mystik Dan's odds to win the Preakness and to complete the Triple Crown feat by winning again at Belmont Park in five weeks, according to industry estimates,\n\nBet here: FanDuel offers No Sweat First Bet of up to $500 for new customers\n\nSince 2018, when Justify became the 13th Triple Crown champion, no Derby winner has gone on to win the Preakness. In fact, each of the 15 Triple Crown races over that five-year stretch has been won by a different horse.\n\nCalifornia Chrome (2014) is the most recent horse to win the first two legs of the Triple Crown but lose in the Belmont. Big Brown (2008), Smarty Jones (2004), Funny Cide (2003), War Emblem (2002), Charismatic (1999), Real Quiet (1998), and Silver Charm (1997) are other recent examples of Triple Crown hopefuls who came up one race short of capturing all three jewels. In 2012, Derby and Preakness winner I'll Have Another was scratched from the Belmont the day before the race.\n\nThe racing world hopes Mystik Dan can at least win the Preakness and give the sport a chance at its 14th Triple Crown champion and join this elite group of three-year-old thoroughbreds:", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_for_the_Roses_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run for the Roses (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimlico_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pimlico Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thoroughbred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brown_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Brown (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justify_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justify (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charismatic_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charismatic (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Emblem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War Emblem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Charm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver Charm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Quiet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Quiet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smarty_Jones", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smarty Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I'll_Have_Another", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "I'll Have Another"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funny_Cide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Funny Cide"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Skating/Roller_Skating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Skating/Roller Skating", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Developers_and_Publishers/Iron_Crown_Enterprises", "label": "dmoz/Games/Developers and Publishers/Iron Crown Enterprises", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-05/AP20127666926466.jpg?itok=eCSG1Sp3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539947", "eventUri": "eng-9539947", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "textStart": 241, "textEnd": 247}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-08", "textStart": 1497, "textEnd": 1503}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

She had a win-place-show rate of 52% (4-3-5).\n\nSaturday's win was the first in the Derby for all of Mystik Dan's connections: his aforementioned owners, trainer Kenny McPeek (had been 0 for 9 in the Derby, with his best previous showing a second-place finish with Tejano Run in 1995); and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. (this was his fifth appearance in the Run for the Roses, with his prior best result eighth with McCraken in 2017).\n\nMystik Dan's most notable ancestor is 1978 Triple Crown winner Affirmed. Other members of his bloodline include Alydar (who finished second to Affirmed in all three Triple Crown races in 1978), Tiznow (the first, and still only, back-to-back winner of the Breeders' Cup Classic in 2000 and 2001, as well as the only horse to win the prestigious event more than once) and Storm Cat (three times the leading broodmare sire in North America from 2012 through 2014) and twice the leading sire in North America in 1999 and 2000).\n\nThis story will be updated.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldencents", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Goldencents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graded stakes race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_breeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse breeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeders'_Cup_Dirt_Mile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Anita_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santa Anita Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tejano_Run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tejano Run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiznow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiznow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storm Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alydar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alydar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affirmed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeders'_Cup_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breeders' Cup Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539947", "eventUri": "eng-9539947", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

The horses made contact several times, and a photo appears to show Gaffalione making contact with Forever Young with his left hand.\n\n\"He wanted to lean in today and made it a little difficult,\" Gaffalione said after the race. \"I had a hard time keeping him straight, and that definitely cost us. He gives you everything, very responsive, but he loses concentration.\"\n\nSierra Leone trainer Chad Brown defended Gaffalione on Sunday morning.\n\n\"What Tyler was really attempting to do was make room for his left stick, which (Sierra Leone) really respects and keeps him straight,\" Brown said. \"The bumping and the tight duel between those horses disarmed him with the stick. All he had was a rein to pull on, and it really hurt his momentum.\"\n\nSakai did not claim foul after the race.\n\n\"Claims of foul do not happen much in Japan,\" said Hiroshi Ando, racing manager for Forever Young trainer Yoshito Yahagi. \"It is the stewards' call, not us.\"\n\nSome race fans have been critical of the race stewards for not posting an inquiry after the race to further examine the Sierra Leone-Forever Young battle.\n\nThe KHRC addressed that issue in its statement Monday.\n\n\"The stewards review every race in Kentucky live and by video replay before posting it official, and they followed the same procedure for the 150 running of the Kentucky Derby,\" the KHRC statement said. \"After conducting their standard review of the race, determining no further review or investigation was necessary to conclude there were no incidents that altered the finish of the race, and seeing there were no objections filed, the stewards posted the Kentucky Derby official.\"\n\nJason Frakes: 502-582-4046; jfrakes@courier-journal.com.

(AP) -- Mystik Dan won the 150th Kentucky Derby in a dramatic three-horse photo finish, edging out Sierra Leone and Forever Young for the upset victory. It was the 10th Derby to be decided by a nose, the closest margin in horse racing. Sent off at 18-1 odds, Mystik Dan and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. rode the rail down the stretch with a short lead. Sierra Leone and Forever Young from Japan gave chase and pressured the leader to the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs on Saturday.

Mystik Dan ran 1 1/4 miles in 2:03.34 and paid $39.22 to win.\n\nEdwards scores 43 points, Reid erupts in 4th to help Timberwolves beat Nuggets 106-99 in Game 1\n\nDENVER (AP) -- Anthony Edwards scored a playoff career-high 43 points, Naz Reid had 14 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter and the Minnesota Timberwolves beat the defending NBA champion Denver Nuggets 106-99 in Game 1 of the second-round series Saturday night. Edwards was unstoppable in the first half, scoring 25 points, and Reid took over in the fourth quarter. Game 2 is Monday night in Denver. Three days after undergoing knee surgery, Timberwolves coach Chris Finch was on the bench in the second row, next to the scorer's table and behind assistant coach Micah Nori, who did the instructing, roaming and switching. Two-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic had 32 points, eight rebounds and nine assists for Denver.\n\nDavid Pastrnak scores in overtime to lift Bruins to Game 7 win over rival Maple Leafs\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- David Pastrnak scored on a feed from Hampus Lindholm 1:54 into overtime and the Boston Bruins beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 2-1 in Game 7 to clinch their first-round series and advance in the NHL playoffs. Jeremy Swayman finished with 30 saves and Lindholm had the tying goal in regulation to help the Bruins avoid losing their second straight first-round series after holding a 3-1 lead. They have now defeated the rival Maple Leafs in Game 7 of the first round of the playoffs three times in the last seven years. Boston will meet the Florida Panthers, who upset the Bruins in seven games in the first round last year.\n\nCanelo Alvarez retains undisputed championship with unanimous decision over Jaime Munguia\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) -- Canelo Alvarez held off a feisty challenger Saturday night, proving to be the stronger and more effective boxer to retain his undisputed super middleweight championship, winning by unanimous decision to hand Jaime Munguia his first loss. Tim Cheatham scored the fight 117-110, David Sutherland had it 116-111 and Steve Weisfeld scored the fight 115-112. Alvarez is 61-2-2. He closed as a minus-380 at BetMGM. Alvarez overcame a somewhat slow start to dominate the challenger. Munguia is 43-1.\n\nMessi has a record-setting game with a goal and 5 assists in Inter Miami's 6-2 win over Red Bulls\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Lionel Messi set three MLS records with a goal and five assists as Inter Miami trounced the New York Red Bulls 6-2. His six goal contributions, five assists and five assists in a half were all league records. Fresh after earning MLS Player of the Month Award for April, Messi has scored and assisted in six consecutive league matches. Luis Su\u00e1rez had three goals and Matias Rojas scored twice as Inter Miami scored six unanswered goals to come back from a 1-0 halftime deficit. Inter Miami remains atop the Eastern Conference with 24 points. Dante Vanzeir gave New York the first-half lead. The Red Bulls dropped to 4-2-5.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nTaylor Pendrith leads Byron Nelson as one of several seeking first PGA Tour victory\n\nMcKINNEY, Texas (AP) -- Taylor Pendrith has a one-shot lead going into the final round of the CJ Cup Byron Nelson. The Canadian is among several leaders seeking his first PGA Tour victory. Pendrith chipped in twice for consecutive eagles to kick-start his round of 8-under 63. It's the third time for back-to-back eagles on tour this season. Pendrith is at 19 under, one shot ahead of second-round leader Jake Knapp. First-round leader Matt Wallace is another shot back in a tie with Ben Kohles.\n\nYankees slugger Aaron Judge ejected for first time in his career\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge was ejected for the first time in his career when he argued a called third strike by plate umpire Ryan Blakney in the seventh inning of Saturday's game against the Detroit Tigers. With one out, Judge took a full count fastball from Tyler Holton that he thought was slightly outside. Blakney rang him up, Judge glanced back and was ejected. After starting to walk back to the dugout, Judge returned to argue the call and manager Aaron Boone continued the argument.\n\nKentucky Derby victory aboard Mystik Dan provides signature win for jockey Brian Hernandez Jr.\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. rode Mystik Dan to victory in the 150th Kentucky Derby to complete the most rewarding weekend of his career. The Eclipse Award winner and Breeders' Cup champion won the milestone derby a day after guiding filly Thorpedo Anna to a wire-to-wire victory by 4 3/4 lengths in the Kentucky Oaks. He became the first jockey to complete the Derby/Oaks double since Hall of Famer Calvin Borel in 2009, fitting considering Hernandez studied Borel's derby wins and spent time with him in his Kentucky racing career. And, he's no longer under the radar as a jockey.\n\nCavaliers and Magic to settle playoff series standoff with Game 7 -- the 'best two words in sports'\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cavs and Magic are going to the limit. Unable to find a way to win on the road, Cleveland and Orlando will settle their series on Sunday with a Game 7, a fitting conclusion between two teams that have put their strengths and weaknesses on public display for six games. Only one advances to face the Boston Celtics, who will be well-rested for whichever team escapes this stalemate. The Magic forced Game 7 with a 103-96 at home on Friday night by withstanding a 50-point performance from Cleveland guard Donovan Mitchell.\n\nHaaland scores 4 in another win for Man City. Arsenal isn't going away in the title race, though\n\nErling Haaland scored four goals in another win for Manchester City in its bid to capture an unprecedented fourth straight Premier League crown. Yet Arsenal isn't going away in this title race. Haaland has now at least a hat trick in six of his 63 matches in England's top flight after converting two penalties, powering in a header and curling home a sublime finish in City's 5-1 victory over Wolverhampton. It was a response to Arsenal's 3-0 win over Bournemouth a few hours earlier. Arsenal retained its one-point lead over City but the defending champions have three games left. That's one more than Arsenal. Burnley slipped closer to relegation with a 4-1 loss to Newcastle.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri":

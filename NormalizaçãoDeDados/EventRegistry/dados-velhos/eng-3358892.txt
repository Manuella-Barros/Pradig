How unheard of? Weekly. Weekly sales on beauty newness, along with free products and exclusive offers that'll make the collection of makeup in the bottom of your bag grow seriously out of hand.\n\nSephora calls it -- drumroll, please -- the Weekly Wow.

In an almost annoyingly canny move, the first week is palette-themed and everything is 50 percent off, so good luck resisting. Stila's Eyes Are the Window Shadow Palette is now $24.50; Anastasia Beverly Hills' Contour Cream Kit could be yours for a square $20 bill. Tarte's Rainforest of The Sea Skin Twinkle Lighting Palette, Volume II -- all for only $21. This is too much (greatness, not money).\n\nAccording to Sephora, you'll be able to cash in on the sale both in-store and online, which is great intel in case everything sells out online (for example, what's happening now). You could set an alarm, but Sephora's got our backs: the sales will be announced on social media, through the store's app, and via emails. Beauty Insiders will get a preview every Tuesday before the deal goes live, which is some major incentive.\n\nThe brand says that despite the palette-y start, each week won't have a set theme moving forward, so expect variety. And while it's aiming for 50 percent off on everything, that could change.

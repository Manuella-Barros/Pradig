But as well as a pair of diamond earrings, Phoebe was also spotted wearing a diamond ring on her engagement finger.\n\nAlthough the photo shared by Phoebe's mum Sally 24 hours later had no caption, both Phoebe and Cameron, who is also an actor and the son of Hollywood producer Brad Fuller, looked absolutely smitten with each other and Phoebe is seen jumping into his arms in delight. It looked like the pair could have been at a fancy country house hotel from the background, which also showed a rainbow. The Mirror has reached out to Sally and Phoebe's reps for further comment on this story.\n\nPhoebe is the daughter of Coronation Street legend Sally Dynevor Phoebe's mum Sally shared this photo of her and Cameron that could be a proposal shot\n\nIf they are engaged, it's certainly been a whirlwind romance for the young couple who first went public with their relationship at Wimbledon last July. Since then they have been packing on the PDA at various red carpet events, including the BAFTAs in February this year, where Phoebe was nominated for the EE Rising Star Award. Though Phoebe refrains from sharing her love life on social media since dating US comic Pete Davidson.\n\nIn perhaps her most high-profile relationship to date, Phoebe and Saturday Night Live star Pete dated for a few months back in 2021. At one point they appeared so smitten they wore matching necklaces with both their initials on and Pete reportedly told friends he was \"really serious\" about her.\n\nBut by August 2021, a month after appearing loved-up at Wimbledon, Phoebe and Pete went their separate ways, with a source blaming conflicting work schedules for the split. Since then, Phoebe has been linked to Spiderman star Andrew Garfield, 39, but it seems 28-year-old Cameron is the man who has won her heart.\n\nThough she hasn't publicly commented on her romance with Cameron, Phoebe told Elle US that she used to be \"naive\" about dating in the public eye until her romance with Pete, which is why she is careful these days about what she posts about her personal life on social media.\n\nReflecting on her career success and relationship with Pete that catapulted her to worldwide stardom, she shared: \"I was really naive. I don't think there was a period of my life as an actress when I thought about fame. My only goal was to work as an actress and not have to have any other jobs. And so I just didn't expect it [Bridgerton] to change my world in the way that it did.\"\n\nShe began dating Pete shortly afterwards, which brought with it another level of fame - and paparazzi. Phoebe continued: \"It just goes back to being naive - I didn't think anyone would care. I was just being a young woman and dating and somehow that provokes a conversation. There were lots of hard lessons I had to learn through basically having a personal life. You realise, 'Oh, I can't live my life in the way that I used to. I have to keep my cards slightly closer to my chest.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTubeand Threads\n\nDo you have a story to sell?

The 29 year old actress first sparked romance rumours with Cameron, 28 last year, with the couple famously keeping a low profile save for a handful of rare public outings, such as Wimbledon 2023.\n\nWith love blossoming between the pair, back in February 2024, Cameron, who is the son of A Quiet Place producer Brad Fuller appeared to be more comfortable with their relationship and accompanied Phoebe to the BAFTA film awards in central London. Yet now, it appears the couple are ready to take things even further, with Phoebe having confirmed her impending nuptials to E! on the red carpet.\n\nIn addition to the huge relationship milestone, Phoebe also made Met Gala history on Monday evening too, when she became the first person to wear Victoria Beckham 's line to the star-studded event of the year.\n\n\"It's her first custom look,\" Phoebe said on Live From E!, \"so I'm thrilled to be wearing it.\"\n\n\"We started with fabrics,\" the English actress explained, before noting how they had wanted to use something \"fragile\" to go along with the Costume Institute's theme, Sleeping Beauties Reawakening Fashion. She soon added: \"Something elegant and beautiful that fits in with this beautiful theme. So, I think we did well.\"\n\nPrimarily constructed from hand-crafted archival lace, the dreamy pink gown carried an ethereal charm befitting a fairytale and featured over 300 lace appliqu\u00e9 flowers stitched onto a tulle base.\n\nIn addition to the flawless gown, Phoebe also sported a charming makeup look courtesy of make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury, who was even on hand to accompany the actress as her date for the evening.\n\nTo build the perfect Met Gala look, Phoebe's skin was prepped with a combination of Charlotte's Magic Cream, \u00a352 and Magic Serum Crystal Elixir, \u00a365 before a light layer of Beautiful Skin Foundation, \u00a339 and Airbrush Flawless Finish Powder, \u00a338 completed the perfect base.\n\nIn order to recreate the actress' iconic flush, a light glaze of Pillow Talk Matte Beauty Blush Wand in Dream Pop, \u00a330 was brushed across Phoebe's cheeks, before a spotlight highlight was applied to her forehead and temples with the Multi-Glow in Romance Light, \u00a335.\n\nNo makeup look would be complete without a signature lip however, and Phoebe was no exception, with the regency rose opting for a soft blurred lip in Matte Revolution's Pizzazz shade, \u00a328.", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri": "phoebe_tonks@ok.co.uk", "name": "Phoebe Tonks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

It was amazing. He's half Thai.\n\n\"And we went to his family's village. His grandma, aunt, and uncle are still there, and it was a really incredible experience.\"\n\nIn 2017, Phoebe was linked to British actor Sean Teale, after she appeared on his Instagram. Phoebe also shared a few snaps of the then-couple to her page, however these have now all been removed.\n\nArguably her most famous relationship to date, Phoebe dated comedian Pete Davidson in 2021.\n\nRumours that the pair might be dating began emerging in the first half of the year, with several fan-sightings of the duo looking \"loved up\" reported by Instagram gossip page, Deux Moi.\n\nIn April, eager-eyed fans noticed the apparent couple were sporting the same necklace on different occasions. The silver chain in question featured the letters 'P D', which happen to be both of their initials. Pete wore the jewellery for an appearance on The Tonight Show, while Phoebe sported it in a YouTube interview.\n\nThat same month, People reported that they had made their romance official, saying the pair were \"really into each other,\" and that Pete was \"telling friends he's serious about her.\"\n\nThe pair went on hard-launched their romance in July of that year, with a PDA-filled visit to Wimbledon that quickly went viral.\n\nTheir relationship ended the following month, with a source citing their competing work schedules as to blame for the split.\n\nReflecting on the six-month romance to ELLE US, Phoebe admitted she was \"naive\" about dating in the public eye.\n\n\"It just goes back to being na\u00efve -- I didn't think anyone would care,\" she shared. \"I was just being a young woman and dating and somehow that provokes a conversation. There were lots of hard lessons I had to learn through basically just having a personal life. You realise, 'Oh, I can't live my life in the way that I used to. I have to keep my cards slightly closer to my chest.' There was a time, for example, when I'd post anything on my Instagram, and now I'm very, very careful about what I put out into the world.\"\n\nIn April 2023, Phoebe appeared to have a new man in her life, after she was spotted by People walking hand in hand with American actor and producer Cameron Fuller. And as of May, 2024, it looks like the couple have only grown stronger, with Phoebe debuting an engagement ring at the Met Gala!\n\nSo what do we know about the man who has stolen her heart?\n\nIn addition to his budding acting career, which has seen him land roles on shows like Insecure, Into the Dark, The Goldbergs, and The Last Ship, Cameron has a successful YouTube channel with Wizards Of Waverly Place actor Gregg Sulkin.\n\nHe is also a graduate of the University of Southern California (where he studied theatre), and the son of Hollywood producer Brad Fuller. According to his Instagram, Cameron now works as a producer at Platinum Dunes, the production company co-founded by his father.\n\nPerhaps in response to the attention her romance with Pete Davidson received, Phoebe has so far stayed tight-lipped on her relationship with Cameron.\n\nThe cute pair were last sighted together in July, when they were spotted in the crowd at Wimbledon.", "source":

I have to keep my cards slightly closer to my chest.'\n\n'Celebrity crush'\n\n\"There was a time, for example, when I'd post anything on my Instagram, and now I'm very, very careful about what I put out into the world.\"\n\nHaving been seen out and about together looking affectionate, Pete confirmed the news he and Phoebe were dating in March 2021 while \u00adparticipating in an online Q&A with students at a US university.\n\nWhen one of the students asked who his celebrity crush was, Pete cheekily replied: \"I'm with my celebrity crush.\"\n\nThe pair made their first public appearance at Wimbledon that July, but called it quits a month later, with Pete living in New York and Phoebe based in London.\n\nPete went on to have a whirlwind relationship with Kim Kardashian, while Phoebe briefly dated Spider-Man actor Andrew Garfield.\n\nA showbiz source said: \"With Pete being so high-profile, the attention she got with him was clearly too much for her.\n\n\"It seems choosing to date a lesser-known person than him was quite intentional.\n\n\"Let's hope Cameron is the down-to-earth man she needs in her life.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish

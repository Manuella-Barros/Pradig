The Celtics completed a gentleman's sweep of the Dallas Mavericks in the 2024 NBA Finals on Monday night to earn the franchise's NBA-best 18th title.\n\nNot only is the occasion momentous for Horford -- who entered the night with 185 playoff games without a championship, second-most in NBA history behind Karl Malone -- but it's also a huge moment for Horford's home country of the Dominican Republic. With the 2024 title in hand, Horford became the first Dominican in league history to win a title.\n\nHorford received a special standing ovation from the home fans at TD Garden following the Game 5 win, with the fans taking a moment to recognize the 38-year-old's sacrifice and contributions.\n\n\"It's been long,\" Horford said with the trophy in hand of how long it's been to get to this moment. \"But I am so proud to be a part of this team, and that it happened now -- Gloria a dios! (Glory to God!)\"\n\nThe 17-year veteran additionally thanked his teammates and family for helping him get to this picture-perfect moment -- something he couldn't have imagined ending in a better way.\n\n\"I can't believe it,\" Horford added with a smile. \"I still can't believe it. We did it, we're here, and I can't believe it. This is just how I pictured it, here at the Garden, with our fans, everybody together -- this is just how I saw it. Eight years ago -- this is how I saw it eight years ago -- [Celtics lead governor] Wyc [Grousbeck] knows about it, Wyc knows about the ring. Eight years ago!\"\n\nReferencing the first time he signed with the Celtics in 2016, Horford certainly went through a journey to get to this point. After three seasons in his first stint in Boston, Horford spent the 2019-20 season with the Philadelphia 76ers and the 2020-21 season with the Oklahoma City Thunder before returning back \"home\" in 2021 to finish the mission. After the 2022 Finals run that fell short to the Golden State Warriors, Horford is finally a champion.\n\nHorford stepped up in the Finals in a massive way for the Celtics. With Kristaps Porzingis sidelined with an ankle injury, Horford returned to the starting lineup for most of the Finals, averaging 7.0 points, 6.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, and 1.2 steals per game.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019\u201320_Oklahoma_City_Thunder_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2019\u201320 Oklahoma City Thunder season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.nbcsportsboston.com/2024/06/cropped-USATSI_23570565.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660502", "eventUri": "eng-9660502", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

The Celtics defeated the Dallas Mavericks in the 2024 NBA Finals on Monday night, securing their 18th title in team history, a new NBA record. For Horford, he was finally able to get over the hump and help lead his team to a championship in his second NBA Finals appearance. At 38 years old and nearing the end of the line in his career, there have been a lot of retirement rumors centered around Horford.\n\nHowever, it does not appear as if the Celtics' veteran is leaving.\n\nEntering the offseason, Horford still has one year left on his contract, and he will make $9.5 million during the 2024-25 season. Although Horford has not said anything about his future since hoisting the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy into the air, Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck made it clear on Tuesday that Boston's locker room leader isn't leaving.\n\n\"Al is coming back for next year. That's what I have been told,\" Grousbeck clearly outlined during a phone appearance on The Greg Hill Show. \"We've got some guys that are getting up there a little bit. Basically, we are a young team. Most of our players are 30 or younger. That is bad news for everyone else, hopefully.\"\n\nThe Celtics are still a fairly young team, as their only players over the age of 30 are Horford (38) and Jrue Holiday (33). Despite their older ages, both Horford and Holiday were instrumental to the success Boston found not just in the playoffs but during the entirety of the regular season.\n\nIf Grousbeck says Horford is coming back, then Celtics fans should expect to see their veteran leader back on the court for his 18th NBA season when the team receives their championship rings in October.\n\nAl Horford's impact on Celtics' championship run\n\nWithout Al Horford, the Celtics are not the dominant team they proved to be all season. He may not possess the All-Star-like talent he once had earlier in his career with the Atlanta Hawks, but Horford is still a very impactful player due to his defensive awareness. Horford also does a lot of the little things to help the Celtics win games, which is why he is still very much one of the best glue guys in the entire league.\n\nWhat makes Horford special, especially in Boston, is how he fits their style of play. Joe Mazzulla preached toughness all year, and he wanted guys next to Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown who were not afraid to fight for loose balls, 50-50 rebounds, and make the unselfish plays on offense.\n\nThis is exactly what Horford brings to the table.\n\nFrom his three-point shooting to his passing at the top of the arc to his toughness on the interior, Horford has rapidly become the heart and soul of this Celtics organization. In the NBA Finals, the veteran big man averaged 7.0 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game while shooting 52.0 percent from the floor and 47.1 percent from three-point range.\n\nIt seemed like every time the Celtics needed to see a jumper fall from the perimeter, Horford was the one that gave them a jolt of energy with a corner three. His natural defensive instincts also made life hard for the Mavericks' offense, as Dallas was never able to settle in the groove and get the ball moving on the interior with Horford constantly jumping around the low block.\n\nPerhaps the greatest achievement for Horford is that he has finally ended his NBA Finals drought. In addition to being the first NBA champion who is older than his head coach since 1969, Horford also ended his dreaded playoff games without a championship streak in his 186th career postseason game. James Harden (166) now holds the longest active streak of playoff games without a title.\n\nThis championship was career-defining for Horford. He was one of the best big men in the league during the 2010s era, and now he can finally call himself a champion.\n\nHowever, one championship may not be enough. Horford appears to be ready to run things back with the Celtics for at least one more year.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brett_siegel@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Brett Siegel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyc_Grousbeck", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wyc Grousbeck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien_Championship_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Al-Horford-retirement-rumors-swiftly-shut-down-by-Wyc-Grousbeck.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660502", "eventUri": "eng-9660502", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

He started all five games of the NBA Finals and averaged 7.0 points, 6.2 rebounds and 2.6 assists per game, including nine points and nine rebounds in Monday's clinching victory. Horford had lost his only other NBA Finals appearance, which came in with the Celtics vs. the Golden State Warriors with the Celtics two seasons ago.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Florida baseball vs Kentucky scouting report, prediction for College World Series game\n\n\"I'm so grateful. I know I've said it before, but it's glory to the Lord for putting me in this position. It's been a lot of years,\" Horford said after the game (via ASAP Sports). \"I don't think it's sunk in yet. I'm going through the emotions right now, but I don't feel like it's over. This is an unbelievable feeling. Yeah, the confetti, everything is going on, but it just hasn't hit me yet.\"\n\nHorford won his first NBA championship in his 186th career playoff game. Only former Utah Jazz great Karl Malone had played in more postseason games without a title (193). Horford was subbed out by coach Joe Mazzula with 2:02 remaining and received a loud ovation from the crowd at TD Garden.\n\n\"Man, nobody deserves it more. Hell of a career. So underrated career. Just does everything for us. Doesn't ask for anything,\" Celtic guard Derrick White said of Horford. \"I'm so happy for him, and I'm glad I could be a part of it. Just an amazing career, and this is just another chapter of it.\"\n\nAl Horford NBA career timeline\n\nHorford became the 10th Florida alum to win an NBA title as a player. He joined Corey Brewer and Marreese Speights as former Gators to win both an NCAA championship and an NBA championship. Brewer, Horford and Joakim Noah led the Gators to back-to-back national championships in 2006 and 2007.\n\nFollowing the 2007 championship run, the Atlanta Hawks selected Horford as the No. 3 overall pick in the 2007 NBA Draft. In that draft class, he currently ranks second behind only Kevin Durant with a win share total of 112.7. Horford signed with the Celtics in 2016 before signing with the Philadelphia 76ers in 2019. He was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2020 before being traded from the Thunder back to Boston in 2021.\n\nAl Horford stats\n\nFor his career, Horford has averaged 13.1 points, 8.0 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 1.2 blocks per game on 51.3% overall shooting and 37.9% from 3-point range. He made the All-Star team five times and the All-NBA, All-Rookie and All-Defensive NBA teams once each.\n\nHorford averaged 8.6 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game this year, his age-37 season. He averaged 7.0 points, 6.2 rebounds and 2.6 assists per game in the NBA Finals. Horford also had 20-point games in the second round and the Eastern Conference finals, proving he can still be a bucket when called upon.\n\n\"Yeah, nobody deserved it more than Al. He's been a great not just leader on the court but off the court as well. Just a mentor. Somebody I know I can talk to about life and is going to give me great advice about family, about finances, about just life, adversity, whatever the case is. Just Al has just been that guy for me and for us,\" Jaylen Brown said of Horford.\n\n\"Like just his performance all season long, like Al is 37, 38 years old, and we leaned on him so much. Probably too much for his age and where he's at. He just delivered. So consistent, so disciplined with his body. Never complains, you know what I mean. The only thing he does is add to winning. For him, great teammate. It's been an honor to be by his side. And Al Horford is a real-life legend and hero. It's been great to be his teammate.\"\n\nWill Al Horford retire?\n\nHorford turned 38 on June 3 and has played in the NBA for 17 seasons. He has one year remaining on his contract with the Celtics. But with a championship trophy in tow and declining numbers, will Horford decide to call it a career following the championship?\n\n\"For me, I never really put a timeframe on it,\" Horford told ESPN after practice on Sunday. \"I want to make sure that I feel healthy, that I'm enjoying what I'm doing and for me, thankfully, I have my wife's support and my family's. That's a big deal to me. ... I feel like I've been asked this for a few years now and I feel good, I want to keep playing. Why not keep going? I don't want to limit myself.\"", "source": {"uri": "eu.gainesville.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pensacola News Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gainesville_sun@eu.gainesville.com", "name":

The Celtics' big man is finally an NBA champion.\n\nHorford struggled to put his feelings into words in the aftermath of Boston's 106-88 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Monday night, which clinched the franchise's 18th NBA title.\n\n\"I don't think it's sunk in yet. I'm going through the emotions right now, but I don't feel like it's over,\" the 38-year-old Horford said at the podium. \"This is an unbelievable feeling. Yeah, the confetti, everything is going on, but it just hasn't hit me yet.\"\n\nHorford checked out of Monday night's victory with just over two minutes to go to a rousing ovation from Boston fans. He extended his arms to the crowd in jubilation, soaking in a moment he'll always cherish. Once the clock hit zero and Horford was officially an NBA champ, he was joined by his father, Tito, an ex-NBA player himself.\n\nIt was a special night for one of the most well-respected players in the NBA and a true leader in the Boston locker room. A starter throughout his career, Horford took a spot on the Boston bench this season after Brad Stevens acquired Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday. That move gave Boston one of the deepest rosters in the league, and helped preserve both Horford and Porzingis throughout the regular season.\n\nHorford was also ready to step up whenever Porzingis needed a night off or went down with an injury, as he did throughout the postseason. He started 15 of Boston's 19 playoff games, and capped off his postseason run with nine points, nine rebounds, and a pair of assists in Monday's clincher.\n\nHorford has spent six of his 17 NBA seasons with the Celtics, initially joining the team in the 2016 offseason in hopes of winning a title in Boston. On Monday night, he recalled meeting with Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck during the courting process, and both he and his agent left the meeting amazed at Grousbeck's 2008 championship ring.\n\n\"We just kept looking at this enormous ring in Wyc's hand. And after the meeting we were like, Did you notice that? That's the attention,\" recalled Horford. \"I never forget what Danny Ainge told me in that meeting. He said, 'You can win championships in many places, but there's nothing like winning in Boston. Nothing like winning as a Celtic.'\"\n\nHorford helped the Celtics to the Eastern Conference Finals in each of his first two seasons with the team, but then departed via free agency in 2019. He spent a season in Philadelphia (losing to the Celtics in the first round) and another in Oklahoma City before Stevens brought him back to Boston.\n\nThe Celtics came up short in the NBA Finals in 2022, but that made this year's title all the more special for everyone on the roster, especially Horford.\n\n\"The first thing you have to do when you come here is you have to embrace that pressure. And I was okay with being in that position. I was okay if we were getting criticized and we weren't getting it done because I understood what it means playing here,\" said Horford. \"Finally overcoming that and winning and putting ourselves with the greats, this is special.\"\n\n\"Nobody deserves it more,\" Derrick White said of Horford. \"Hell of a career. So underrated career. Just does everything for us. Doesn't ask for anything. I'm so happy for him, and I'm glad I could be a part of it. Just an amazing career, and this is just another chapter of it.\"\n\n\"Knowing the type of person that Al is, knowing the leader that he is, even off the court, the father that he is, just the all-around great person and great human, I'd run through a brick wall for him,\" said Jrue Holiday. \"I'm so happy that he got one.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Stevens", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Stevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyc_Grousbeck", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wyc Grousbeck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Ainge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Danny Ainge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/18/cedc1d4b-b62c-4ddc-b30f-92da5bd3052e/thumbnail/1200x630g2/0c7c9ad47e3c5eaf20b77c1cffa32c47/horford.jpg?v=5842509bb796a146f9b20d3e8b03dac6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660502", "eventUri": "eng-9660502", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

But the title was special to Horford for another reason, too.\n\nDrafted into the league back in 2007, Horford, 38, had played 17 NBA regular seasons and more playoff games in league history than any other player without winning a title before the TD Garden game clock struck zero on Monday night.\n\nIn other words, an NBA title was a long time coming for the University of Florida product, who shared a special moment with Celtics fans after he checked out of the game with 2:02 remaining in the fourth quarter, and an NBA Finals win imminent.\n\nAs Celtics public address announcer Eddie Palladino excitedly yelled Horford's name into the microphone, the veteran forward raised his arms in front of the TD Garden crowd, which rose to its feet and gave him a standing ovation.\n\nESPN's Mike Breen put a bow on the moment with a perfect call, saying that Horford has \"waited 17 years for his NBA championship.\"\n\nPerhaps no one summed it up better than Horford's teammate and NBA Finals MVP Jaylen Brown, though.\n\n\"Nobody deserved it more than Al,\" Brown said. \"He's been a great not just leader on the court but off the court as well. ...

With the 2024 title in hand, Horford became the first Dominican in league history to win a title.\n\nHorford received a special standing ovation from the home fans at TD Garden following the Game 5 win, with the fans taking a moment to recognize the 38-year-old's sacrifice and contributions.\n\n\"It's been long,\" Horford said with the trophy in hand of how long it's been to get to this moment. \"But I am so proud to be a part of this team, and that it happened now -- Gloria a dios! (Glory to God!)\"\n\nThe 17-year veteran additionally thanked his teammates and family for helping him get to this picture-perfect moment -- something he couldn't have imagined ending in a better way.\n\n\"I can't believe it,\" Horford added with a smile. \"I still can't believe it. We did it, we're here, and I can't believe it. This is just how I pictured it, here at the Garden, with our fans, everybody together -- this is just how I saw it. Eight years ago -- this is how I saw it eight years ago -- [Celtics lead governor] Wyc [Grousbeck] knows about it, Wyc knows about the ring. Eight years ago!\"\n\nReferencing the first time he signed with the Celtics in 2016, Horford certainly went through a journey to get to this point. After three seasons in his first stint in Boston, Horford spent the 2019-20 season with the Philadelphia 76ers and the 2020-21 season with the Oklahoma City Thunder before returning back \"home\" in 2021 to finish the mission. After the 2022 Finals run that fell short to the Golden State Warriors, Horford is finally a champion.\n\nHorford stepped up in the Finals in a massive way for the Celtics. With Kristaps Porzingis sidelined with an ankle injury, Horford returned to the starting lineup for most of the Finals, averaging 7.0 points, 6.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, and 1.2 steals per game.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019\u201320_Oklahoma_City_Thunder_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2019\u201320 Oklahoma City Thunder season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/56vZa03q6811h.IyIzVjEg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnne.com/d83a2cdc756e3743a28ee7017fec7a9b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660502", "eventUri": "eng-9660502", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

To date, Karl Malone remains the only player who has played the most career playoff games without winning a championship.\n\nPLAYERCAREER PLAYOFF GAMES\n\nKarl Malone\n\n193\n\nAl Horford\n\n186\n\nJohn Stockton\n\n182\n\nSam Perkins\n\n167\n\nJames Harden\n\n166\n\nChris Paul\n\n149\n\nKyle Korver\n\n145\n\nGeorge Hill\n\n144\n\nReggie Miller\n\n144\n\nCharles Oakley\n\n144\n\n\"Al Horford is a real life legend and hero. It's been great to be his teammate,\" Jaylen Brown told reporters after the game.\n\nHad the Celtics become the first team in history to blow a 3-0 series lead and failed to win the 2024 title, Horford would've had to move past Malone, which would've required another playoff run, to own the dubious mark.\n\nBut that's no longer a mark Horford needs to worry about as he became the 48th player in history to win an NCAA championship and NBA championship, and the first player since 1969 to win an NBA title with a head coach who is younger than him, and even that only happened when Bill Russell was a player-coach with the Celtics.\n\nHorford has been one of the league's steadiest winners over what has almost surely been a Hall-of-Fame career. He's only missed the playoffs twice in 17 seasons. If you ignore the 2013-14 playoffs, which he missed due to injury, Horford made the postseason in each of this nine years with the Hawks. Atlanta won six playoff series with Horford on board and have won just two since.\n\nOver two stints with the Celtics spanning six seasons, Horford has appeared in five Eastern Conference finals and two NBA Finals. The only actual team he's been on that didn't qualify for the playoffs was the 2020-21 Thunder. He has never averaged fewer than 30 minutes per game over any single playoff run. He is one of the most reliable players the game has ever seen.\n\nEven in the twilight of his career, Horford has remained a spectacular defender who stretches the floor as a consistent 3-point shooter. He led the 2024 playoffs with a 75% 2-point conversion rate. If there ever were a player who has paid his dues and deserves this championship, it's Horford. This is a great moment for a great player who is by all accounts an even better guy.\n\nAs for who's next? As you can see in the table above, the next active player on the list of playoff games without a title is James Harden, who would have to play in 28 more playoff games over the course of his career without securing a championship to pass Malone.\n\nIn all actuality, that might be within range. Harden is likely going to sign another multi-year contract this summer, and 28 playoff games can add rather up quickly with a couple deep runs, which the Clippers are surely capable of making, provided he re-signs with Los Angeles and that it has a healthy postseason stretch.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brad_botkin@cbssports.com", "name": "Brad Botkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stockton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Stockton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Perkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Perkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Oakley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Oakley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hill_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Hill (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Korver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Korver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/06/18/dbf4bcae-102f-41f6-9f0e-155b87d88c9a/thumbnail/1200x675/c36b7822c8acf7fafa5936a74c4e3f88/untitled-design-2024-06-17t210606-460.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660502", "eventUri": "eng-9660502", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Horford played the most playoff games in NBA history before winning a championship. Horford's significant contributions and leadership helped elevate the Celtics to victory in the postseason.\n\nAfter 17 seasons in the NBA, Al Horford can finally call himself an NBA champion. His Boston Celtics defeated the Dallas Mavericks 4-1 in the 2024 NBA Finals, taking home the franchise's 18th championship trophy. He became the first Dominican Republic player to win an NBA title.\n\nHorford also played in 186 postseason contests before hoisting the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy - the most by any player in league history.\n\nAl Horford- Career Playoff Stats\n\nPPG\n\n12.2\n\nRPG\n\n8.0\n\nFG%\n\n49.3\n\n3PT%\n\n39.1\n\nUSG%\n\n16.5\n\nMPG\n\n33.8\n\nHorford has been on winning teams throughout his career with the Atlanta Hawks, Philadelphia 76ers, and Celtics, but this year felt different. Boston was the clear-cut favorite entering the 2023-2024 campaign, and it reached the top under immense pressure and a giant target on its back.\n\nJrue Holiday told reporters how important Horford is as a teammate and contributor on the court after the Celtics' Game 5 victory.\n\n\"I'd run through a brick wall for him [Horford].\" - Jrue Holiday\n\nPresident of Basketball Operations Brad Stevens acquired Holiday before the campaign started. He has never played with Horford before now in his career. After just one season with the veteran center, Holiday appreciates Horford's drive, dedication, and passion for reaching the top of the sport.\n\nIronically, Holiday runs around \"brick walls,\" or screens, for Horford in games. Holiday's screen navigation is one of the best in the league, taking away the ballhandler's space and decreasing the pick's effectiveness. This allows Horford to stick to his man and cover alley-oops or pocket passes to the opposing center.\n\nHorford Steps Up Big at Age 38 The Celtics' center played a larger role than he or the team envisioned throughout the 2024 postseason\n\nHorford came off the bench behind Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is when Boston was healthy. however, when Porzi\u0146\u0123is injured his calf in Game 4 of the Celtics' opening-round series, Horford knew he was in for a bigger role. He started every game of the postseason following Porzi\u0146\u0123is' injury. Head Coach Joe Mazzulla opted to bring the star center off the bench for continuity and chemistry, as Boston comfortably won its first two series.\n\nThe Celtics do not need to change much offensively when switching between Porzi\u0146\u0123is and Horford, as they both can knock down shots from beyond the arc. The latter shot a playoff career-high five threes per game at a 36.8 percent clip this postseason. Boston's drive-and-kick heavy offense relies on spacing and multiple threats from deep at all times. All eight players in the Celtics' playoff rotation did damage from downtown.\n\nHorford was one of the main reasons Boston dominated both ends of the floor throughout this season. Now, he can enjoy the special moment he envisioned when he first signed with the Celtics in the summer of 2016.\n\nRelated Jaylen Brown Says NBA Finals MVP Is Shared 'With My Brothers and Partner in Crime'\n\nJaylen Brown notched his second straight series MVP award as the Boston Celtics won the 2024 NBA Finals.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien_Championship_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Stevens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Stevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mixcollage-18-jun-2024-12-34-pm-8973.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660502", "eventUri": "eng-9660502", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

But the title was special to Horford for another reason, too.\n\nDrafted into the league back in 2007, Horford, 38, had played 17 NBA regular seasons and more playoff games in league history than any other player without winning a title before the TD Garden game clock struck zero on Monday night.\n\nIn other words, an NBA title was a long time coming for the University of Florida product, who shared a special moment with Celtics fans after he checked out of the game with 2:02 remaining in the fourth quarter, and an NBA Finals win imminent.\n\nAs Celtics public address announcer Eddie Palladino excitedly yelled Horford's name into the microphone, the veteran forward raised his arms in front of the TD Garden crowd, which rose to its feet and gave him a standing ovation.\n\nESPN's Mike Breen put a bow on the moment with a perfect call, saying that Horford has \"waited 17 years for his NBA championship.\"\n\nPerhaps no one summed it up better than Horford's teammate and NBA Finals MVP Jaylen Brown, though.\n\n\"Nobody deserved it more than Al,\" Brown said. \"He's been a great not just leader on the court but off the court as well. ...

Nothing like winning as a Celtic.'\"\n\nWhen Celtics coach Joe Mazzula -- who is three years younger than the 17-year veteran -- subbed Horford out of Game 5 with 2:02 remaining in the fourth quarter and Boston well on its way to a 106-88 victory over the Dallas Mavericks, the crowd let the forward hear it with a booming ovation.\n\n\"Nobody deserved it more than Al,\" said Jaylen Brown, the Finals MVP. \"He's been a great not just leader on the court but off the court as well. ... It's been an honor to be by his side. And Al Horford is a real-life legend and hero. It's been great to be his teammate.\"\n\nIn his 186th career postseason game with three different teams in the Atlanta Hawks, Philadelphia 76ers and Boston, Horford posted 9 points, 9 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals -- one of which came by diving to the floor to corral the ball and pitch it ahead to Brown for an easy score to put the Celtics up 54-39 late in the second quarter.\n\nGary Payton previously held the mark, playing 152 postseason games before winning it all with the Miami Heat. Karl Malone holds the record for most postseason games without a title (193).\n\nHorford's decision to sign with Boston in 2016 coincided with the drafting of Brown and came just before the Celtics brought in Jayson Tatum in 2017, ushering a string of conference finals appearances and two Finals berths.\n\nWith Kristaps Porzingis sidelined with a calf injury for most of the postseason, Horford's impact was immense, scoring 22 points with 15 rebounds and 5 assists in a close-out win over the Cleveland Cavaliers in the second round and putting up 23 points, 5 rebounds and 3 blocks in a Game 3 win over the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals to put Boston in position to sweep.\n\n\"We leaned on him so much,\" Brown said. \"Probably too much for his age and where he's at. He just delivered. So consistent, so disciplined with his body. Never complains, you know what I mean. The only thing he does is add to winning.\"\n\nHorford, who was born in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, celebrated the aftermath of the title with his daughter in his arms as she held a Dominican flag. He is the first Dominican-born player to win an NBA championship.\n\n\"Hell of a career,\" Celtics forward Derrick White said. \"So underrated career. Just does everything for us. Doesn't ask for anything. I'm so happy for him, and I'm glad I could be a part of it. Just an amazing career, and this is just another chapter of it.\"\n\nHorford, who is under contract next season with Boston for $9.5 million, addressed how much longer he will consider playing after practice Sunday.\n\n\"For me, I never really put a timeframe on it,\" Horford told ESPN. \"I want to make sure that I feel healthy, that I'm enjoying what I'm doing and for me, thankfully, I have my wife's support and my family's. That's a big deal to me. ... I feel like I've been asked this for a few years now and I feel good, I want to keep playing. Why not keep going? I don't want to limit myself.\"\n\nFrom the sounds of it, Horford sticking around would sit just fine with the Celtics.\n\n\"Knowing the type of person that Al is, knowing the leader that he is, even off the court, the father that he is, just the all-around great person and great human,\" Celtics guard Jrue Holiday said, \"I'd run through a brick wall for him.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportal.co.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportal -

The veteran stopped by a Raising Cane's restaurant in Boston's Back Bay to talk to the media, sign some autographs, and even get behind the counter to help take customers' orders.\n\nFans showed up by the hundreds, braving a brutal heat wave for a chance to meet Horford. The former Florida Gator has been in the NBA for 17 seasons, including six with Boston. In that time, he's made a strong connection with the city thanks to his dedication and leadership. Earlier this week, he helped lead the Celtics to a coveted 18th banner and a first title since 2008. Horford, who turned 38 this June, was the backbone of the team's defense and a critical leader on and off the court. The fanfare on Thursday was a recognition of that milestone.\n\nIn winning a title, Horford became the first ever player from the Dominican Republic to win an NBA championship. He spoke about what that meant with reporters before the event began.\n\nIt fills me with a lot of pride,\" Horford said. \"And a lot of joy. My dad being the first Dominican player to ever play in the NBA, and for me to get to this point in this moment, you know?\"\n\n\"I understand that I represent more than myself and my family.\" Horford added.\n\nHorford's father Tito played three seasons in the NBA with the Milwaukee Bucks and the then-Washington Bullets (now, Wizards). He also played overseas for several years, and nowadays is a mainstay on the sideline at Celtics games.\n\nThe Dominican Republic has a rich and growing affinity for basketball. The country of 11 million also has very strong ties to the Boston area. Thousands of people of Dominican descent live in Boston proper, representing 6% of the city's entire population. Massachusetts has the fourth-largest Dominican population in the entire country.\n\nHorford spoke about why that dynamic makes playing for the Celtics so special, and why he's so proud to win a title in this city.\n\n\"There's not only the country over there,\" Horford said. \"But the community here. The community here is very strong in Boston and in Massachusetts, and I know people here are very happy.\"\n\nHorford explained that he hopes he can be a source of inspiration for young people like him. This is the first time anyone has seen a Dominican player win an NBA championship, after all.\n\n\"I'm happy to be able to bring the community that joy,\" Horford said. \"And hopefully be able to inspire younger kids to do different things in their lives. So for me that the biggest thing. That next generation to be able to see that and identify with me.\"\n\nHorford is proud to blaze a path for the Dominican Republic. Not because he wants the glory of being the first, but because he is happy to be a model for others.\n\n\"I know years ago when David Ortiz won.\" Horford beamed. \"When David, Manny Ramirez, Pedro Martinez won here, I feel like they inspired a bunch of us. Now I feel like hopefully I can do the same for other people.\"\n\nOrtiz has been a major influence on Horford since he first came to Boston. Horford told Celtics Wire he hasn't yet talked to Ortiz, but mostly because he hasn't had a chance to go through his phone yet. Instead, he's been celebrating with close friends and family at his home, and only now beginning to engage with the rest of the world.\n\nHorford didn't just win the title for his family or for the Dominican diaspora. He knows that the city of Boston is too dynamic to be any one thing, but that the city celebrates its winners.\n\n\"I feel like here in Boston,\" Horford said. \"There's like a real tight community. Like, that's a real thing.\"\n\n\"There is just a sense of community here and the togetherness that we have here in Boston, that's very special.\" Horford said.\n\nListen to the \"Celtics Lab\" podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3zBKQY6\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3GfUPFi\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3F9DvjQ\n\nRecapping the Boston Celtics winning the 2024 NBA Finals The Boston Celtics are NBA Champions - Live from the 2024 NBA Finals with Noa Dalzell The moment the Boston Celtics won Banner 18 The Boston Celtics finally won Banner 18; now what?

Horford, then a free agent, had been distracted by the massive 2008 Celtics championship ring team owner Wyc Grousbeck had on during the meeting.\n\nAside from the ring, Horford said that a line from Ainge had also stuck with him since then and had ultimately convinced him to sign with Boston.\n\n\"I'll never forget what Danny Ainge told me in that meeting,\" said Horford. \"He said, 'You can win championships in many places. But there's nothing like winning in Boston and nothing like winning as a Celtic.'

Horford is now tied as the fourth-oldest player to win an NBA championship, according to StatMuse. The Dominican Republic native contributed as a starter with 9 points, 9 rebounds, 2 steals and 2 assists in 31 minutes.\n\n\"It means everything. It's special,\" Horford told Andscape after the triumph. \"I can't believe that this has happened. It hasn't sunk in. But, man, I give God the glory. My journey has been tough. But this is special and I'm going to take this in.\n\n\"My age is the bigger testimony for me. To be able to compete and play at this high level, I just feel very blessed.\"\n\nHorford, who held his daughters as they waved Dominican Republic flags during the championship celebration, became the first Dominican to win an NBA title. It was his second Finals appearance after losing with the Celtics to the Golden State Warriors in 2022.\n\nHorford told Andscape before the game there were Finals watch parties in his honor in his hometown of Puerto Plata at the Parque Central Independencia. The well-known meeting point was constructed as a tribute to Gen. Gregorio Luperon, the 28th president of the Dominican Republic from 1879-80. But on this night, Parque Central Independencia was a meeting point to celebrate Horford. There were similar watch parties all over the Dominican Republic.\n\n\"I just hope this inspires a younger generation to dream and understand that if they set their mind to it, they can be in this position as well,\" Horford said. \"It wasn't a given for me to be in the NBA. I want to just give hope to the next generation.\"\n\nThe Dominican Republic is a proud and successful baseball country, and nothing will change that. But Horford's wife, Amelia Vega, a singer and former Miss Universe, told Andscape she expects countless Dominican children to be inspired to play basketball now due to this championship.\n\n\"I really haven't stopped a minute to think about everything I'm feeling,\" Vega said. \"I'm grateful with the Lord. [I'm] Proud, proud of my husband and the team for what they have accomplished ...\n\n\"It's amazing. Everyone is very proud of him in the Dominican Republic. Seeing the support, it's huge. And I know we're going to see a big generation of Dominican basketball players coming after this soon, hopefully.\"\n\nThere was a lot of support in Boston -- Vega believed they had about 30 family members at the game, besides their five children and Horford's parents, former NBA center Tito Horford and Arelis Reynoso. The kids went to the championship stage with their father. As Horford made the media rounds postgame, his son and eldest child, 9-year-old Ean, smiled and proudly followed his father around. Horford previously told Andscape that was excited that Ean was old enough to enjoy his basketball success.\n\n\"I'm so happy. I dreamed for this. I'm so proud. He worked very hard this year and I'm very happy for him,\" Ean told Andscape.\n\nHorford had several friends in attendance, including former MLB pitcher and childhood friend Julio Borb\u00f3n.\n\n\"I've known Al since he was 6 years old,\" Borb\u00f3n told Andscape. \"I get emotional just seeing where he is at this point in his career. He was finally able to get this championship.\n\n\"We are on a [text] thread from elementary to all the way up. Everybody is excited for him and happy. They have seen the 17 years he has put in. They can't wait to celebrate him and talk about how they feel about his journey so far.\"\n\nHorford played in his first career playoff game as a rookie with the Atlanta Hawks on April 20, 2008, against the 2008 NBA champion Celtics. The Hawks team pushed Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen and that Celtics squad to seven games in their first-round series. Allen, Leon Powe, Brian Scalabrine and Eddie House are members of the Celtics' 2008 title team who attended Game 5 on Monday.\n\nHorford entered Game 5 as second in NBA history in postseason games played without winning a title. The only NBA player who played in more postseason games without winning a title was two-time NBA MVP Karl Malone, who played in a record 193 playoff games without a championship.\n\nHorford strongly appreciates that his longevity has connected him to NBA legends.\n\n\"It's pretty special. Obviously, you want to win in these positions, but when you're being mentioned with guys like that, that have had a lot of success in the playoffs, that's kind of special,\" Horford said.\n\nThree days before the NBA Finals began, Horford celebrated his 38th birthday with friends and family in Boston.\n\nThe days of a big birthday party in a nightclub have been long over for the husband and father. Instead, the excitement came from watching kids running around and lots of dancing. On what Horford described as a \"cheat day,\" the menu included native food such as Dominican sausage, sweet plantains, moro rice and fried cheese and steak.\n\n\"We also had a little music, too. Some merengue,\" Horford said.\n\nHorford, Malone, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (four times), Tim Duncan and Mavericks coach Jason Kidd were the only players 38 or older to have started in the NBA Finals. Horford joined Kidd, who played for the 2011 NBA champion Mavericks, as the only two to win their first NBA titles at 38 years old. Horford is also three years older than Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla.\n\nWith or without a title, Horford was strongly respected by Mazzulla and his teammates.\n\n\"At 38 years old man, he's a fabric guy,\" Celtics forward Jaylen Brown, the NBA Finals MVP, told Andscape. \"[He] Keeps us together. I can't say enough about him. Great person off the court, a great leader, and just solid. You know you can rely on him.\"\n\nWhen asked what the key for Horford is playing at 38, Mazzulla said, \"Just his professionalism. He's just the best. I mean, the way he takes care of his body, his consistency, who he is as a person, as a great teammate. He's everything you want in an organization and a coach, and he's one of the cornerstones of what we do.\"\n\nBefore tipoff, Horford went to the rim and hung from the net, as usual. He also led to the first cheer from the Celtics fans by winning the tipoff. At the halftime buzzer, Celtics guard Payton Pritchard nailed his second half-court shot of the Finals -- after a rebound and pass from Horford -- to push Dallas' lead to 67-46. The Celtics were up by as many as 26 points and were never challenged by Dallas the rest of the way.\n\nWith 2:02 remaining and Boston up 106-88, Horford came out of the game for the last time. As he walked to the bench, he raised both hands into the air toward the Celtics fans as they cheered. Shortly afterward, Boston's 16-year championship drought was over, and a league-best championship banner No. 18 was claimed.\n\n\"It was a relief, man,\" Horford said. \"It's hard with the expectations of winning in Boston. But just the relief, I still can't believe it. I'm talking about this right now, but I still can't believe it.\"\n\nHorford's sisters believed in their brother.\n\n\"I knew he had it in him. Absolutely. Especially this season. This team was different. It wasn't just him. But that whole team,\" Horford's sister Maria Horford said.\n\n\"He was determined,\" Horford's sister Anna Horford said.\n\nSo, what is the key to Horford playing until he was nearly 40 years old? Horford credited his great body shape and diet, but he primarily credits his Christian faith for helping him to be mentally strong and confident on the NBA floor.\n\n\"I love playing. I enjoy being in a team setting and just being a part of an NBA team, an NBA locker room,\" Horford said. \"I really just find joy in this. Just the routine, the process of it. My body feels good. Obviously [there are] bumps and bruises throughout the season, but for me the biggest thing is just trying to stay in a good place physically so I can be able to play.\n\n\"What puts me over the top even more than the physical is my faith. The spiritual part and the mental part are carrying me. There is so much that comes with all this. And people can lift weights and eat right and do whatever. But for me, my Christian faith, that's the biggest distinction and difference for my longevity. God has spoken to my heart.\"\n\n\"He's a man of faith and he's a Christian. [God has] giving him everything he knows to unveil the secrets of how to stay young and prominent like he is,\" Vega said.\n\nAfter seeing Horford's work ethic for years, Borb\u00f3n said that he is not surprised that Horford is still playing at 38.\n\n\"I know what he is about,\" Borb\u00f3n said. \"Things that people don't get to see, I've been able to be a part of and see. It's pretty rewarding and inspiring even for me at this stage.\"\n\nIf you think Horford may retire from the NBA now that he has won a championship, think again.\n\nHorford has one year and $9.5 million remaining on his contract with the Celtics. The 6-foot-9, 240-pounder averaged 8.6 points and 6.4 rebounds while starting in 33 of 65 regular-season games this season. There don't appear to be any major signs of decline, and Horford told Andscape he would love to play into his 40s.\n\n\"My whole thing is like, I want to feel good,\" Horford said. \"I want to feel like I'm able to contribute. I can have an impact on the game and that I feel good and that I'm enjoying this and I'm enjoying it, man. So, I'm not really going to put an age limit on it type thing. It feels good right now.\n\n\"It would be special [playing into his 40s]. There's not a lot of guys that can say they can do that. LeBron [James] is almost there. But it'd be nice if I can do it and I can keep going.\"\n\nKeep going for himself, his family, his friends, the Celtics and the Dominican Republic.", "source": {"uri": "andscape.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Andscape"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marc_j_spears@andscape.com", "name": "Marc J.

After 17 NBA seasons - including six non-consecutive seasons with the Boston Celtics - Horford has finally reached basketball's biggest stage with the Celtics' Game 5 Finals-clinching win over the Dallas Mavericks on Monday night.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of his long-awaited championship, Horford went back to his early days with the Celtics - before he even officially signed in Boston. One of the top free agents available in the summer of 2016 after a successful nine years with the Atlanta Hawks, the Celtics were recruiting Horford to be the franchise's biggest free agent signing in decades. During one of Horford's first meetings with the Celtics, then-president of basketball operations Danny Ainge used a pitch that finally came to fruition on Monday night.\n\n\"It was crazy because during free agency meetings in 2016, my agent and I, Jason Glushon, were both sitting in the meeting and we just kept looking at this enormous ring on [Celtics governor] Wyc [Grousbeck]'s hand,\" Horford recalled. \"And after the meeting we were like, 'did you notice that?' That was the attention.\"\n\n\"Man, I never forget what Danny Ainge told me in that meeting. He said, 'you can win championships in many places, but there's nothing like winning in Boston. Nothing like winning as a Celtic.'\" Horford continued. \"And that stuck with me from that meeting. I was like, 'man, I'm trying to be great, and that's what I want.'\"\n\nNow, Ainge's vision and Horford's goal is complete as he becomes an NBA champion at 37 years old - even if he hasn't fully realized it yet.\n\n\"I don't think it's sunk in yet,\" Horford said in his postgame press conference. \"I'm going through the emotions right now, but I don't feel like it's over. This is an unbelievable feeling. Yeah, the confetti, everything is going on, but it just hasn't hit me yet.\"\n\nGiven his age and role as a leading veteran presence on the team though, he wasn't the only one who had his title status at the forefront.\n\n\"Nobody deserved it more than Al. He's been a great not just leader on the court but off the court as well,\" Finals MVP Jaylen Brown noted after the game. \"Great teammate. It's been an honor to be by his side. And Al Horford is a real-life legend and hero. It's been great to be his teammate.\"\n\nAsked about Horford, first-year Celtic Jrue Holiday said of winning a title for Horford, \"it was like one of the ultimate goals of this season.\"\n\n\"Knowing the type of person that Al is, knowing the leader that he is, even off the court, the father that he is, just the all-around great person and great human, I'd run through a brick wall for him,\" Holiday added. \"I'm so happy that he got one.\"\n\n\"Man, nobody deserves it more. Hell of a career. So underrated career. Just does everything for us. Doesn't ask for anything,\" Derrick White echoed. \"I'm so happy for him, and I'm glad I could be a part of it. Just an amazing career, and this is just another chapter of it.\n\nHorford's title adds to an already-extensive resume. He's a five-time All-Star and has been named to All-NBA, All-Defense, and All-Rookie teams in his career. At 37 there's a real chance Monday night was his final game, and if so it was a fitting cap on a career that - well, his teammates put it best.", "source": {"uri": "985thesportshub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "98.5 The Sports Hub - Boston's Home For Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Ainge", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Danny Ainge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Outplacement", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Outplacement", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://985thesportshub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/88/2024/06/USATSI_23570682-2_1718693086_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660502", "eventUri": "eng-9660502", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Soon, the trophy was in Jayson Tatum's hands.\n\nHowever, everyone on the stage wanted to make sure 17-year veteran Al Horford was next.\n\n\"Nobody deserved it more than Al,\" Jaylen Brown said. \"He's been a great not just leader on the court but off the court as well. Just a mentor. Somebody I know I can talk to about life and is going to give me great advice about family, about finances, about just life, adversity, whatever the case is. Just Al has just been that guy for me and for us.\"\n\n\"Knowing the type of person that Al is, knowing the leader that he is, even off the court, the father that he is, just the all-around great person and great human, I'd run through a brick wall for him,\" said Jrue Holiday, who admitted it was a little strange that just a year ago he was trying to prevent Horford from getting a ring. \"I'm so happy that he got one.\"\n\nHorford had tasted a championship before, he won two NCAA titles while at the University of Florida under now Bulls coach Billy Donovan, with teammates Joakim Noah and Corey Brewer.\n\nThe NBA mountain, however, can take much longer and be harder to climb. Horford was a five-time All-Star, an All-NBA and All-Defensive Team player, but he did not have a ring.\n\nHe saw Grousbeck's 2008 ring during his 2016 free agency meetings and that's part of what drew Horford to the Celtics eight years ago (he left the team in 2019 as a free agent and signed with Philadelphia, which traded him to Oklahoma City in 2020, then in 2021 the Thunder traded him back to the Celtics, where he re-signed and has been since).\n\n\"Man, I never forget what Danny Ainge told me in that meeting,\" Horford said. \"He said,' You can win championships in many places, but there's nothing like winning in Boston. Nothing like winning as a Celtic.' And that stuck with me from that meeting. I was like, man, I'm trying to be great, and that's what I want.\"\n\nHorford has been a great fit, a player the Celtics have repeatedly turned to when other things didn't go to plan -- like Kristaps Porzingis getting injured in the Finals.\n\nHorford embraced Boston and being a Celtic in a way not every player does -- and that has made him a fan favorite.\n\n\"The first thing you have to do when you come here is you have to embrace that pressure. And I was okay with being in that position,\" Horford said. \"I was okay if we were getting criticized and we weren't getting it done because I understood what it means playing here.

Nothing like winning as a Celtic.'\"\n\nWhen Celtics coach Joe Mazzula -- who is three years younger than the 17-year veteran -- subbed Horford out of Game 5 with 2:02 remaining in the fourth quarter and Boston well on its way to a 106-88 victory over the Dallas Mavericks, the crowd let the forward hear it with a delirious ovation.\n\n\"Nobody deserved it more than Al,\" said Jaylen Brown, the Finals MVP. \"He's been a great not just leader on the court but off the court as well. ... It's been an honor to be by his side. And Al Horford is a real-life legend and hero. It's been great to be his teammate.\"\n\nIn his 186th career postseason game with three different teams in the Atlanta Hawks, Philadelphia 76ers and Boston, Horford posted 9 points, 9 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals -- one of which came by diving to the floor to corral the ball and pitch it ahead to Brown for an easy score to put the Celtics up 54-39 late in the second quarter.\n\nGary Payton previously held the mark, playing 152 postseason games before winning it all with the Miami Heat. Karl Malone holds the record for most postseason games without a title (193).\n\nHorford's decision to sign with Boston in 2016 coincided with the drafting of Brown and came just before the Celtics brought in Jayson Tatum in 2017, ushering a string of conference finals appearances and two Finals berths in 2022 -- when Boston lost to the Golden State Warriors -- and the title over Dallas.\n\nWith Kristaps Porzingis sidelined with a calf injury for most of the postseason, Horford's impact was immense, scoring 22 points with 15 rebounds and 5 assists in a close-out win over the Cleveland Cavaliers in the second round and putting up 23 points, 5 rebounds and 3 blocks in a Game 3 win over the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals to put Boston in position to sweep.\n\n\"We leaned on him so much,\" Brown said. \"Probably too much for his age and where he's at. He just delivered. So consistent, so disciplined with his body. Never complains, you know what I mean. The only thing he does is add to winning.\"\n\nHorford, who was born in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, celebrated the aftermath of the title with his daughter in his arms as she held a Dominican flag. He is the first Dominican-born player to win an NBA championship.\n\n\"Hell of a career,\" Celtics forward Derrick White said. \"So underrated career. Just does everything for us. Doesn't ask for anything. I'm so happy for him, and I'm glad I could be a part of it. Just an amazing career, and this is just another chapter of it.\"\n\nHorford, who is under contract next season with Boston for $9.5 million, addressed how much longer he will consider playing after practice Sunday.\n\n\"For me, I never really put a timeframe on it,\" Horford told ESPN. \"I want to make sure that I feel healthy, that I'm enjoying what I'm doing and for me, thankfully, I have my wife's support and my family's. That's a big deal to me. ... I feel like I've been asked this for a few years now and I feel good, I want to keep playing. Why not keep going? I don't want to limit myself.\"\n\nFrom the sounds of it, Horford sticking around would sit just fine with the Celtics.\n\n\"Knowing the type of person that Al is, knowing the leader that he is, even off the court, the father that he is, just the all-around great person and great human,\" Celtics guard Jrue Holiday said, \"I'd run through a brick wall for him.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com",

But he wasn't much for the personal praise as the longtime veteran and \"OG\" of the Celtics locker room instead made it about the team.\n\nSure, he was in his 17th season in the league. Horford was also the active player with the most playoff games played without winning a championship. But he instead talked about how a title is bigger than him as an individual. Well, after the Celtics did finally get to the mountaintop by winning the NBA Finals, Horford's teammates were more than happy to heap praise on the 17-year veteran.\n\n\"Obviously once I became his teammate, it was like one of the ultimate goals of this season,\" Jrue Holiday said. \"Knowing the type of person that Al is, knowing the leader that he is, even off the court, the father that he is, just the all-around great person and great human, I'd run through a brick wall for him. I'm so happy that he got one.\"\n\nHorford and the C's can celebrate getting to that banner. Horford's experienced plenty of heartbreak throughout his playoff career. But now, he'll get sized for a ring just like the one he saw back on Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck's hand in 2016 during a free agency pitch.\n\n\"Nobody deserved it more than Al. He's been a great not just leader on the court but off the court as well,\" Jaylen Brown said. \"Just a mentor. Somebody I know I can talk to about life and is going to give me great advice about family, about finances, about just life, adversity, whatever the case is. Just Al has just been that guy for me and for us.\"\n\nHorford also shared an anecdote about former Boston president Danny Ainge. Ainge told Horford, \"You can win championships in many places, but there's nothing like winning in Boston. Nothing like winning as a Celtic.\"\n\nHorford said that spoke right to him as he chose the Celtics to be great.\n\n\"I'm so grateful,\" Horford said. \"I know I've said it before, but it's glory to the Lord for putting me in this position. It's been a lot of years. I don't think it's sunk in yet. I'm going through the emotions right now, but I don't feel like it's over. This is an unbelievable feeling.

To date, Karl Malone remains the only player who has played the most career playoff games without winning a championship.\n\nPLAYER\n\nCAREER PLAYOFF GAMES\n\nKarl Malone\n\n193\n\nAl Horford\n\n186\n\nJohn Stockton\n\n182\n\nSam Perkins\n\n167\n\nJames Harden\n\n166\n\nChris Paul\n\n149\n\nKyle Korver\n\n145\n\nGeorge Hill\n\n144\n\nReggie Miller\n\n144\n\nCharles Oakley\n\n144\n\nHad the Celtics become the first team in history to blow a 3-0 series lead and failed to win the 2024 title, Horford would've had to move past Malone, which would've required another playoff run, to own the dubious mark.\n\nBut that's no longer a mark Horford needs to worry about as he became the 48th player in history to win an NCAA championship and NBA championship, and the first player since 1969 to win an NBA title with a head coach who is younger than him, and even that only happened when Bill Russell was a player-coach with the Celtics.\n\nHorford has been one of the league's steadiest winners over what has almost surely been a Hall-of-Fame career. He's only missed the playoffs twice in 17 seasons. If you ignore the 2013-14 playoffs, which he missed due to injury, Horford made the postseason in each of this nine years with the Hawks. Atlanta won six playoff series with Horford on board and have won just two since.\n\nOver two stints with the Celtics spanning six seasons, Horford has appeared in five Eastern Conference finals and two NBA Finals. The only actual team he's been on that didn't qualify for the playoffs was the 2020-21 Thunder. He has never averaged fewer than 30 minutes per game over any single playoff run. He is one of the most reliable players the game has ever seen.\n\nEven in the twilight of his career, Horford has remained a spectacular defender who stretches the floor as a consistent 3-point shooter. He led the 2024 playoffs with a 75% 2-point conversion rate. If there ever were a player who has paid his dues and deserves this championship, it's Horford. This is a great moment for a great player who is by all accounts an even better guy.\n\nAs for who's next? As you can see in the table above, the next active player on the list of playoff games without a title is James Harden, who would have to play in 28 more playoff games over the course of his career without securing a championship to pass Malone.\n\nIn all actuality, that might be within range. Harden is likely going to sign another multi-year contract this summer, and 28 playoff games can add rather up quickly with a couple deep runs, which the Clippers are surely capable of making, provided he re-signs with Los Angeles and that it has a healthy postseason stretch.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brad_botkin@cbssports.com", "name": "Brad Botkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stockton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Stockton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Oakley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Oakley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hill_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Hill (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Perkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Perkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Korver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Korver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/06/18/dbf4bcae-102f-41f6-9f0e-155b87d88c9a/thumbnail/1200x675/c36b7822c8acf7fafa5936a74c4e3f88/untitled-design-2024-06-17t210606-460.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660502", "eventUri": "eng-9660502", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

It does not sound like that is the plan.\n\nIn an interview with \"The Greg Hill Show\" on WEEI Tuesday morning, Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck revealed that Horford is planning to return to the team next season.\n\n\"Al is coming back for next year,\" Grousbeck said. \"That's what I've been told. ... He loves it here. He and his family love it here. He couldn't be happier, and we are also happy to have him.\"\n\nGrousbeck also noted how the Celtics beat Horford's Atlanta Hawks in 2008 on the way to Boston's last NBA championship. That gives you some perspective into how long Horford has been chasing a title.\n\nGame 5 of the NBA Finals was the 186th postseason game of Horford's career. No player appeared in more postseason games before winning a championship than the former Florida star. Gary Payton held the previous mark at 152 career playoff games before he won it all with the Miami Heat. Karl Malone holds the record for most postseason games without winning a championship, which is 193.\n\nHorford is still under contract with the Celtics next season at a reasonable $9.5 million. He told ESPN's Dave McMenamin on Sunday that he feels good and wants to keep playing next year.\n\nHorford averaged 8.6 points and 6.4 rebounds per game during the regular season. He played 26.8 minutes per game in the regular season and saw his role expand to 30.3 minutes per game in the playoffs. In addition to being a leader, Horford averaged 9.2 points and 7.0 rebounds per game during Boston's championship run. There is no question the Celtics value him and are hoping to have him back.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_delvecchio@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Steve DelVecchio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Farm_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State Farm Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Payton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Payton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Al-Horford-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660502", "eventUri": "eng-9660502", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

And after finally feeling what it's like to win an NBA title, Horford is obviously looking to run it back in hopes the Celtics can stay on top.\n\nHorford spoke to Fox News Digital on his way into Boston's Raising Cane's location, where he will be surprising Celtics fans with a celebratory \"shift\" behind the counter. He said it's his first time leaving the house, as he's still in awe of what happened on Monday night after defeating the Dallas Mavericks in five games.\n\n\"You know, it's starting to slowly sink in,\" Horford explained. \"If I'm being completely honest with you, I still can't believe it.

And now -- finally, after nearly two decades in professional basketball -- an NBA champion.\n\nThe Celtics' 106-88 victory over Dallas at TD Garden on Monday night both ended their 16-year championship drought and gave Horford his first NBA title.\n\nHorford had helped the Gators win NCAA titles in the 2006 and 2007 seasons.\n\nEntering Monday, only Karl Malone had played more NBA playoff games without a title than Horford's 185, spread across stints with Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia and Oklahoma City.

But I'm so proud to be part of this team and that it happened now.\"\n\nHorford's unselfishness was a vital ingredient in Boston's run to Banner 18. A starter throughout his career -- including in his first five seasons as a Celtic -- he accepted a move to the bench following the offseason additions of Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis, giving the Celtics the deepest roster in basketball.\n\nWhen Porzingis went down with a calf injury four games into the playoffs, Horford stepped back into his familiar old role and delivered some of the most resonant performances of the postseason.\n\nHorford hit six 3-pointers as part of a 22-point, 15-rebound, four-block tour de force in the second-round closeout win over Cleveland, then sank seven 3-pointers to help the Celtics rally past Indiana in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nIn all 16 of its playoff victories, Boston scored more points than it allowed with Horford on the floor. He started the final 15 games, with a limited Porzingis coming off the bench three times in the Finals.\n\nHorford played 32 minutes in Monday's clincher, tallying nine points, nine rebounds, two assists and one steal.\n\n\"I can't believe it,\" he said. \"I still can't believe it. We did it, we're here, but I can't believe it. This is just how I pictured it, here at the Garden with our fans, everybody together.

Finally.", "body": "The championship that eluded the esteemed Horford is at last his, after 17 seasons and 186 playoff games.\n\nSometimes, when longstanding dreams become fulfilled and everything has proven possible, the right words to capture the spirit of the thing can be elusive.\n\nAnd sometimes, in the best of times, they're right there waiting.\n\nTell me, Celtics fans, how does this sound this morning?\n\nMaybe the words themselves aren't quite poetic. But what they stand for is the sweetest kind of poetic justice.\n\nThe championship that eluded the esteemed Horford is at last his, after 17 seasons and 186 playoff games. He's deserved it for a long time. It's no wonder that in the moments after it became a reality, Horford was still processing the experience.\n\n\"I don't think it's sunk in yet. I'm going through the emotions right now, but I don't feel like it's over,\" said Horford, goggles on his forehead and a grin on his face, after the Celtics clinched their 18th championship with a 106-88 victory over the Mavericks Monday night at TD Garden, wrapping up the NBA Finals in a tidy five games.\n\n\"I don't think it's sunk in yet. I'm going through the emotions right now, but I don't feel like it's over. The confetti [is falling], everything is going on, but it just hasn't hit me yet.\"\n\nWhen a team wins a championship -- especially one that has overcome so much, from unfulfilled previous quests (this was their sixth trip to the conference finals and second to the Finals in eight years) to amplified media narratives ringing in their players' ears -- it's human nature for each of the victors to be happiest for, well, themselves.\n\nBut Horford might be the runner-up on every last one of his teammates' ballots.\n\nJayson Tatum, who sits next to Horford on the team plane, has often called him the best teammate he's ever had. One got the sense after the Celtics' clinching victory it is not an outlier of an opinion.\n\n\"Knowing the type of person that Al is, knowing the leader that he is, even off the court, the father that he is, just the all-around great person and great human, I'd run through a brick wall for him,\" said Jrue Holiday. \"I'm so happy that he got one.\"\n\nSaid Derrick White: \"Man, nobody deserves it more. Hell of a career. So underrated. Just does everything for us. Doesn't ask for anything. I'm so happy for him, and I'm glad I could be a part of it.\"\n\nAnd one more testimonial: \"You know, everybody loves him,\" said Kristaps Porzingis. \"And he gave everything to this team. He deserves it more than anybody.\"\n\nThe championship is the Celtics' first since 2008. That journey included a seven-game victory over rookie Horford's Atlanta Hawks in the first round.\n\nIt would be understandable if, in his younger days, he thought championships would be easier to come by. He won back-to-back national titles in college at Florida.\n\nWhen he came to the Celtics in July 2016 as the first prime-of-his-career player to sign in Boston as a free agent, one of the deciding factors was the opportunity to win in a market where winning is not a quest, but a demand.\n\nHorford smiled Monday night recalling his meeting during free agency, and how Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck's 2008 championship ring caught his and agent Jason Glushon's attention.\n\n\"We were both sitting in the meeting,\" said Horford, \"and we just kept looking at this enormous ring in Wyc's hand. And after the meeting we were like, 'Did you notice that?'\n\n\"I'll never forget what Danny Ainge told me in that meeting. He said, 'You can win championships in many places, but there's nothing like winning in Boston. Nothing like winning as a Celtic.'\n\n\"And that stuck with me from that meeting. I was like, man, I'm trying to be great, and that's what I want.\"\n\nHorford's route to becoming a champion in Boston was not linear. After the bitter end to the 2019 season, when Kyrie Irving checked out on his teammates long before the season's final buzzer and the Celtics folded up in a conference semifinals loss to the Bucks, he signed as a free agent with the rival 76ers.\n\nAfter an ill-fitting season there and another in limbo with Oklahoma City, Brad Stevens brought Horford back to Boston in his first move as the Celtics' president of basketball operations.\n\nEven with the layovers elsewhere, Horford has been the quintessential Celtic, someone for Tatum and Jaylen Brown to lean on, a still-tough defender and steady 3-point shooter who plays a decade younger than his age.\n\nHis performance Monday night was a fitting sample. He scored 9 points in 32 minutes, and all of them were meaningful, from knocking down the Celtics' first 3-pointer in the first quarter to a sneaky important driving layup with just over 3 minutes left in the first half and the Mavericks attempting to rally, to another 3-pointer off a Jaylen Brown feed with just under 10 minutes left in the third quarter to build the lead to 75-50.\n\nHe also corralled nine rebounds and was a team-best plus-23 in the first half. Yet what will be remembered best is not anything he did on the court, but his departure from the game with 2 minutes and 2 seconds remaining, the confirmation that the party was about to begin.\n\nThere are conversations to be had, now and mostly later, about Horford's place in history. The championship feels like the missing piece on his Hall of Fame resume, which includes those two Gator titles, five NBA All-Star appearances, and All-Defense and All-NBA nods.\n\nThe metric win-shares says Horford's most similar statistical comps include Robert Parish, Bob Lanier, and Wes Unseld, all easy enshrinees in Springfield. (We will ignore Bill Laimbeer's place on this list, for reasons that require no further explanation. The Chief can take care of him.)\n\nI will also hear the argument, and nod in agreement, that Horford's No. 42 should someday dangle from the Garden rafters.\n\nHow can you not get caught up in the mood and magic of the moment? After enduring so many excellent seasons that fell achingly short of a dream fulfilled, the Celtics came through in exhilarating, validating fashion.\n\nOf course, it takes time for that to set in, for the wonderful reality to stop feeling surreal.\n\nAs he stepped off the podium following the game, Horford gripped his son Ean's hand and made his way out of the interview room.\n\nHe'll be hearing that beautiful string of words for the rest of his life.", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chad_finn@boston.com", "name": "Chad

While there was some speculation that the 38-year-old may retire this summer, Horford isn't ready to hang his kicks up just yet.\n\nAccording to Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck, Horford will be back with Boston for the 2024-25 NBA season.\n\n\"Al is coming back for next year,\" Grousbeck told WEEI's The Greg Hill Show on Tuesday morning. \"That's what I've been told.\"\n\nGrousbeck also confirmed Horford's return to WBZ-TV's Dan Roche later in the day Tuesday. Horford is signed through next season with a $9.5 million salary.\n\nHorford was instrumental to Boston's title run all season. He took a backseat to Kristaps Porzingis and came off the bench for the first time in his career during the regular season, though he still started 33 games as Porzingis nursed smaller injuries or got days off. Then in the playoffs when Porzingis went down with serious ailments, Horford was there to fill in somewhat seamlessly with some solid defense and a handful of big threes.\n\nHorford started 15 of Boston's 19 games in the playoffs, and averaged 9.2 points off 47.8 percent shooting and 7.0 rebounds per contest. He had a huge Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals, sinking seven three-pointers and scoring 23 points in a win over the Indiana Pacers. He also had a huge Game 5 of the East Semis against the Cleveland Cavaliers, scoring 22 points and pulling down 15 rebounds as Boston won the series to advance the Conference Finals.\n\nHis return for next season means the Celtics will have its core back next season. Jaylen Brown is set to begin his supermax extension, and Jayson Tatum will receive his own in the coming months. Porzingis and Jrue Holiday are both locked in, and Derrick White should be getting an extension from Boston this summer.\n\nHorford has some experience winning back-to-back titles too, as he did so in college with the Florida Gators. The Celtics are currently the betting favorites to repeat in 2025, and it would be a storybook ending for Horford to potentially end his NBA career the same way he ended his collegiate career.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyc_Grousbeck", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wyc Grousbeck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/18/af6dab0f-e5af-488d-95e2-55f57ef42f12/thumbnail/1200x630g2/72bf56da03b003906cb55375a942b5aa/al-horford.jpg?v=5842509bb796a146f9b20d3e8b03dac6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660502", "eventUri": "eng-9660502", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

This is an unbelievable feeling. Yeah, the confetti, everything is going on, but it just hasn't hit me yet.\"\n\nHorford's undergone two stints with the Celtics during his last eight seasons played, experiencing the heartbreak of losing in the Eastern Conference finals three times plus a Finals loss in 2022. He's been an All-Star, played with the Isaiah Thomas-led underdog Celtics and most recently stepped up in place of an injured Kristaps Porzingis this postseason, draining a career-high seven 3-pointers in a stellar 23-point performance in Game 3 against the Pacers in the conference finals, hungry and determined once again.\n\nTherefore, pulling for Horford, a five-time All-Star with now-186 games of playoff experience, was extremely easy for everyone in Boston's locker room.\n\n\"Nobody deserved it more than Al,\" Jaylen Brown claimed. \"He's been a great not just leader on the court but off the court as well. Just a mentor. Somebody I know I can talk to about life and is going to give me great advice about family, about finances, about just life, adversity, whatever the case is. Just Al has just been that guy for me and for us.\"\n\nHorford scored nine points on 3-of-6 shooting with nine rebounds, two assists, and two steals, which doesn't represent how active and engaged he was on both ends of the floor from the game's opening tip. Once it was time to trot across the finish line, Horford raised his arms in a Rocky Balboa triumph style, heading back to the bench with 2:02 left in the fourth quarter; left with nothing to do but wait for the final buzzer to sound.\n\nIt's a long-time moment several Celtics teammates had envisioned sharing with Horford for a while.\n\n\"Once I became his teammate, it was like one of the ultimate goals of this season,\" Jrue Holiday said. \"Knowing the type of person that Al is, knowing the leader that he is, even off the court, the father that he is, just the all-around great person and great human, I'd run through a brick wall for him. I'm so happy that he got one.\"\n\nTo not only win but do so in Boston was a full-circle moment for Horford. Back in 2008, the then-Hawks rookie center fresh out of Flordia, experienced a first-round postseason elimination at the hands of the then-Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, and Kevin Garnett-led Celtics before that trio raised Banner 17.\n\nHorford averaged 12.6 points, helping Atlanta take Boston to seven games, however, it wasn't enough, and would take over a decade until he'd return to the same building to finally experience that championship fulfillment.\n\n\"We've had a lot of hardships the last few years,\" Horford admitted. \"Last year, heartbreaker against Miami, Game 7. Year before, Golden State. It's been building up.

A five-time All-Star. A universally respected locker room leader. And now -- finally, after nearly two decades in professional basketball -- an NBA champion.\n\nThe Celtics' 106-88 victory over the Dallas Mavericks at TD Garden ended Boston's 16-year championship drought and gave Horford his first title.\n\nEntering Monday, only Karl Malone had played more NBA playoff games without a title than Horford's 185, spread across stints with Atlanta, Philadelphia and Boston. The 38-year-old now can remove himself from that ignominious list.\n\n\"It's been long,\" a beaming Horford said postgame. \"A lot of hard work. But I'm so proud to be part of this team and that it happened now.\"\n\nHorford's unselfishness was a vital ingredient in Boston's run to Banner 18. A starter throughout his career -- including in his first five seasons as a Celtic -- he accepted a move to the bench following the offseason additions of Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis, giving the Celtics the deepest roster in basketball.\n\nThen, when Porzingis went down with a calf injury four games into the playoffs, Horford stepped back into his familiar old role and delivered some of the most resonant performances of the postseason.\n\nHorford hit six 3-pointers as part of a 22-point, 15-rebound, four-block tour de force in the second-round closeout win over Cleveland, then sank seven threes to help the Celtics rally past Indiana in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nIn all 16 of its playoff victories, Boston scored more points than it allowed with Horford on the floor. He started the final 15 games, with a limited Porzingis coming off the bench three times in the Finals.\n\nHorford played 32 minutes in Monday's clincher, tallying nine points, nine rebounds, two assists and one steal.\n\n\"I can't believe it,\" he said. \"I still can't believe it. We did it, we're here, but I can't believe it. This is just how I pictured it, here at the Garden with our fans, everybody together. This is just how I saw it eight years ago.\"\n\nAs the on-court trophy ceremony wound down, Horford's father, Tito, himself an ex-NBA player, walked toward the Celtics' family area in the bowels of TD Garden, extended both arms above his head and bellowed: \"Yes!

Finally. - The Boston Globe", "body": "Maybe the words themselves aren't quite poetic. But what they stand for is the sweetest kind of poetic justice.\n\nThe championship that eluded the esteemed Horford is at last his, after 17 seasons and 186 playoff games. He's deserved it for a long time. It's no wonder that in the moments after it became a reality, Horford was still processing the experience.\n\n\"I don't think it's sunk in yet. I'm going through the emotions right now, but I don't feel like it's over,\" said Horford, goggles on his forehead and a grin on his face, after the Celtics clinched their 18th championship with a 106-88 victory over the Mavericks Monday night at TD Garden, wrapping up the NBA Finals in a tidy five games.\n\n\"I don't think it's sunk in yet. I'm going through the emotions right now, but I don't feel like it's over. The confetti [is falling], everything is going on, but it just hasn't hit me yet.\"\n\nWhen a team wins a championship -- especially one that has overcome so much, from unfulfilled previous quests (this was their sixth trip to the conference finals and second to the Finals in eight years) to amplified media narratives ringing in their players' ears -- it's human nature for each of the victors to be happiest for, well, themselves.\n\nBut Horford might be the runner-up on every last one of his teammates' ballots.\n\nJayson Tatum, who sits next to Horford on the team plane, has often called him the best teammate he's ever had. One got the sense after the Celtics' clinching victory it is not an outlier of an opinion.\n\n\"Knowing the type of person that Al is, knowing the leader that he is, even off the court, the father that he is, just the all-around great person and great human, I'd run through a brick wall for him,\" said Jrue Holiday. \"I'm so happy that he got one.\"\n\nSaid Derrick White: \"Man, nobody deserves it more. Hell of a career. So underrated. Just does everything for us. Doesn't ask for anything. I'm so happy for him, and I'm glad I could be a part of it.\"\n\nAnd one more testimonial: \"You know, everybody loves him,\" said Kristaps Porzingis. \"And he gave everything to this team. He deserves it more than anybody.\"\n\nThe championship is the Celtics' first since 2008. That journey included a seven-game victory over rookie Horford's Atlanta Hawks in the first round.\n\nIt would be understandable if, in his younger days, he thought championships would be easier to come by. He won back-to-back national titles in college at Florida.\n\nWhen he came to the Celtics in July 2016 as the first prime-of-his-career player to sign in Boston as a free agent, one of the deciding factors was the opportunity to win in a market where winning is not a quest, but a demand.\n\nHorford smiled Monday night recalling his meeting during free agency, and how Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck's 2008 championship ring caught his and agent Jason Glushon's attention.\n\n\"We were both sitting in the meeting,\" said Horford, \"and we just kept looking at this enormous ring in Wyc's hand. And after the meeting we were like, 'Did you notice that?'\n\n\"I'll never forget what Danny Ainge told me in that meeting. He said, 'You can win championships in many places, but there's nothing like winning in Boston. Nothing like winning as a Celtic.'\n\n\"And that stuck with me from that meeting. I was like, man, I'm trying to be great, and that's what I want.\"\n\nHorford's route to becoming a champion in Boston was not linear. After the bitter end to the 2019 season, when Kyrie Irving checked out on his teammates long before the season's final buzzer and the Celtics folded up in a conference semifinals loss to the Bucks, he signed as a free agent with the rival 76ers.\n\nAfter an ill-fitting season there and another in limbo with Oklahoma City, Brad Stevens brought Horford back to Boston in his first move as the Celtics' president of basketball operations.\n\nEven with the layovers elsewhere, Horford has been the quintessential Celtic, someone for Tatum and Jaylen Brown to lean on, a still-tough defender and steady 3-point shooter who plays a decade younger than his age.\n\nHis performance Monday night was a fitting sample. He scored 9 points in 32 minutes, and all of them were meaningful, from knocking down the Celtics' first 3-pointer in the first quarter to a sneaky important driving layup with just over 3 minutes left in the first half and the Mavericks attempting to rally, to another 3-pointer off a Jaylen Brown feed with just under 10 minutes left in the third quarter to build the lead to 75-50.\n\nHe also corralled nine rebounds and was a team-best plus-23 in the first half. Yet what will be remembered best is not anything he did on the court, but his departure from the game with 2 minutes and 2 seconds remaining, the confirmation that the party was about to begin.\n\nThere are conversations to be had, now and mostly later, about Horford's place in history. The championship feels like the missing piece on his Hall of Fame resume, which includes those two Gator titles, five NBA All-Star appearances, and All-Defense and All-NBA nods.\n\nThe metric win-shares says Horford's most similar statistical comps include Robert Parish, Bob Lanier, and Wes Unseld, all easy enshrinees in Springfield. (We will ignore Bill Laimbeer's place on this list, for reasons that require no further explanation. The Chief can take care of him.)\n\nI will also hear the argument, and nod in agreement, that Horford's No. 42 should someday dangle from the Garden rafters.\n\nHow can you not get caught up in the mood and magic of the moment? After enduring so many excellent seasons that fell achingly short of a dream fulfilled, the Celtics came through in exhilarating, validating fashion.\n\nOf course, it takes time for that to set in, for the wonderful reality to stop feeling surreal.\n\nAs he stepped off the podium following the game, Horford gripped his son Ean's hand and made his way out of the interview room.", "source":

Age 38, which is unbelievable.\n\n\"Ironically, we won in '08 over Al's team,\" Grousbeck continued. \"The [Atlanta] Hawks took us to seven in the first round. So, we were part of his drought, and now he came home to us. He loves it here. He and his family love it here. He couldn't be happier. We are also happy.\"\n\nThe 38-year-old Horford won his first ring in Game 5's 106-88 title-clinching victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Monday night, ending the league's longest active streak of career playoff games without a championship (186). James Harden is now the active record-holder with 166 games, while Karl Malone is the all-time record holder with 193 games.\n\nHorford, a five-time All-Star, is set to make $9.5 million next season, which will be his 18th in the league.\n\nHorford took a backseat to Celtics offseason acquisition Kristaps Porzingis during the 2023-24 regular season but stepped up in the playoffs, averaging 9.2 points, 7.0 rebounds and 2.1 assists this postseason. He started in 15-of-19 playoff games after Porzingis missed time due to various injuries.\n\nAs one of the Celtics' most reliable playoff veterans, Horford is also the all-time leader in Finals' three-point shooting percentage, per StatMuse.\n\n\"My whole thing has always been this: as long as I feel good physically,\" Horford said of his retirement plans in February. \"I don't want to feel limited. I don't want to be not myself out there. So, I don't want to put a limit on it. And that's the one thing that I saw from Tom [Brady], one of the things I took from him that I thought was great.

Jrue Holiday said \"one of the ultimate goals of this season\" was getting Horford his trophy.\n\n\"(He's) just the all-around great person and great human,\" Holiday said. \"I'd run through a brick wall for him. I'm so happy that he got one.\"\n\nJaylen Brown, the NBA Finals MVP, teared up when asked about Horford's impact. Both arrived in Boston in 2016, with Horford returning for a second stint in 2022 after two seasons with Philadelphia and Oklahoma City.\n\n\"Al is 37, 38 years old, and we leaned on him so much,\" Brown said. \"Probably too much for his age and where he's at. He just delivered. So consistent, so disciplined with his body. Never complains. The only thing he does is add to winning. Great teammate. It's been an honor to be by his side. Al Horford is a real-life legend and hero. It's been great to be his teammate.\"\n\nAs for Horford, he said the feeling of winning a championship, after 186 career playoff appearances, had yet to truly register. He recalled ogling Grousbeck's 2008 championship ring during his free agent meeting with the Celtics eight years ago, desperately wanting one of his own.\n\n\"Man, I never forget what Danny Ainge told me in that meeting,\" said a grinning Horford, who was a rookie on the Atlanta Hawks team Boston beat during the '08 title run. \"He said, 'You can win championships in many places, but there's nothing like winning in Boston. Nothing like winning as a Celtic.' And that stuck with me.\"\n\nHorford served as the Celtics' sixth man this season following the additions of Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis, but injuries to Porzingis thrust him back into the starting lineup for most of the playoffs. He started Boston's final 15 games, topped 20 points twice and notched nine points, nine rebounds, two assists and two steals in Monday's finale.\n\n\"Al is an unbelievable teammate, unbelievable person,\" Porzingis said. \"Everybody loves him. He's a great leader. Knowing how he has been chasing this for so long in his career and finally get it done, and playing at a high, high level at his age -- man, I don't even know words I could use to describe him. ... He gave everything to this team. He deserves it more than anybody.\"\n\nNews broke late Monday night that Porzingis, who played through pain to log 16 minutes in the Game 5 clincher, will need offseason surgery to repair his \"rare\" leg injury and will be sidelined for several months.\n\nHe's not the only one.\n\nDuring a postgame \"SportsCenter\" interview, head coach Joe Mazzulla revealed he'll also have to go under the knife now that Boston's season is over.\n\n\"Hey, guess what? I've got to have knee surgery,\" Mazzulla said when asked how he plans to celebrate the Celtics' championship. \"I tore my meniscus in March after we lost to Atlanta. ... I'm going to be out a little while. I've been working through it since March.\"\n\nMazzulla, who trains in mixed martial arts when he's not patrolling the Celtics' sideline, said he's aiming to \"get back on the mats hopefully in the next three to five months.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old is the youngest NBA head coach to win a championship since Bill Russell in 1969. He faced sharp criticism during and after his first season in charge -- which began with a last-second promotion to replace the suspended Ime Udoka and ended with an upset loss to eighth-seeded Miami in the Eastern Conference finals -- but validated the Celtics' trust by leading a dominant title-winner in Year 2.\n\n\"Praise and criticism are both just as dangerous if you don't handle them well,\" Mazzulla said in his postgame news conference. \"... And it's Boston. We wouldn't want it any other way. ...\n\n\"If someone tells you 'Good job',\" that's just as dangerous as someone telling you you suck. But you need both of them in order to get to where you want to get to, and there's no place else I'd rather be.\"\n\nCeltics senior consultant Jeff Van Gundy is off to Los Angeles to become the Clippers' lead assistant under Tyronn Lue, according to an ESPN report.\n\nA longtime NBA head coach and commentator, the 62-year-old Van Gundy joined Boston's front office last October after being laid off by ESPN.\n\nVan Gundy had been rumored as a candidate for a role on the Celtics coaching staff next season, as Boston will need to replace at least one of Mazzulla's lieutenants. Top assistant Charles Lee was hired as the Charlotte Hornets' next head coach last month but remained with Boston through the Finals.\n\nAll of the Celtics' regulars are under contract through at least one more season, and of them, only Horford and Holiday are older than 29. \"We've got some guys who are getting up there a little bit, (but) basically we're a young team,\" Grousbeck said on WEEI. \"Most of our players are 30 or younger, and that is bad news for everyone else, hopefully.\" ... The Celtics jetted off to Miami on Tuesday for some championship celebrations. Their duck boat parade through Boston is scheduled for Friday at 11 a.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

His raw talent and top-level basketball IQ, on both the offensive and defensive ends of the court, have made him a fixture in the TD Garden.\n\nHe has started, came off the bench, and been an All-Star. He has performed whatever was asked of him as long as he has worn No. 42 in green.\n\nNow, at long last, he is an NBA champion and should be the last to ever wear it.\n\nAs a Celtic, Horford has seen several iterations of this team and has been a foundational cornerstone of all of them. He was there for the Isaiah Thomas Eastern Conference Finals run, which was Jaylen Brown's rookie year. He was an All-Star in 2018 during Jayson Tatum's rookie year and another Eastern Conference run. He was perhaps the only guiding light during the 2019 Kyrie Irving year, which ended in the second round. He was there for the 2022 Finals run, last year's Conference Finals run.\n\nNow, at long last, he has gotten to the pinnacle as an NBA Champion.\n\nIt's been a long journey for Horford. He began his NBA career in Atlanta in 2007. In 2016, Horford chose to come to Boston. He was a big free-agency signing for Boston at the time. Looking back, a championship was always on his mind from his initial meeting with owner Wyc Grousbeck and then GM Danny Ainge.\n\n\"During free agency meetings in 2016, my agent and I, Jason Glushon, we were both sitting in the meeting and we just kept looking at this enormous ring in Wyc's hand,\" Horford said after the Game 5 Finals win. \"And we both after the meeting were like 'Did you notice that?'...I never forget what Danny Ainge told me in that meeting he said 'You can win championships in many places but there is nothing like winning in Boston, nothing like winning as a Celtic,' and that stuck with me from that meeting.\"\n\nIn 2019 when he left for other opportunities, many thought he was washed and his career would soon draw to a close. Celtics General Manager Brad Stevens thought differently, having coached Horford from 2016 to 2019, and traded for him in 2021. Allowing many fans to dust off their #42 jerseys and rejoice that Horford was back home. In retrospect, the trade was a steal for Boston.\n\n\"And the fact that [a Championship] has come, it has happened, [Tatum and Brown] stepping up in a big way leading us, it's special,\" Stevens said.\n\nHorfords remarkable odyssey as a basketball player includes many accolades. He won two NCAA championships at Florida and was a five-time NBA All-Star. He has one All-NBA Third Team appearance, one All-NBA Defensive Second Team appearance, and an NBA All-Rookie First Team appearance. And now he is the first Dominican NBA Champion.\n\nIt's difficult to say where the Celtics would be without Horford. His intangible leadership qualities have shown themselves within the organization and are also reflected back in every player he has impacted. The effect he will have left behind goes beyond any box score or resume. He is invaluable.\n\nHorfords career isn't completely over, but it is in its twilight. Now that he and the 2024 team can be recognized as the Banner 18 Celtics, he should also be coronated individually with No. 42 in the rafters.", "source": {"uri": "hardwoodhoudini.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hardwood Houdini"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Thomas_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Thomas (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Ainge", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Danny Ainge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyc_Grousbeck", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wyc Grousbeck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Stevens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Stevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Rookie_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Rookie Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4820,h_2711,x_0,y_107/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/18/01j0p3jqwyj28wz0yfdk.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660502", "eventUri": "eng-9660502", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Ironically, we won in [2008] over Al's team. The [Atlanta] Hawks took us to seven in the first round. So we were part of his drought, and now he came home to us. He loves it here -- he and his family love it here. He couldn't be happier, and we are also happy to have him.\"\n\nHorford, a five-time All-Star who last earned a selection during his first stint with the Celtics in 2017-18, has one year remaining on a two-year, $19.5 million deal.\n\nHorford was an invaluable member of Boston's rotation during the playoffs, particularly after an injury to Kristaps Porzingis sidelined the team's starting center from the middle of the first round until Game 1 of the Finals.\n\nHorford averaged 9.2 points, 7 rebounds and 2.1 assists across 19 postseason games, per StatMuse. He also connected on nearly 37% of his 3-point attempts, which allowed for the adequate floor spacing the Celtics need to take advantage of mismatches in their five-out scheme.\n\nDefenses don't have to respect Horford in the same way they must respect Porzingis as an explosive offensive threat. However, Horford was good enough in his stead.\n\nHorford, now 38 years old, also can't offer the Celtics the type of rim protection Porzingis does. However, he remains versatile enough on defense to switch regularly and keep quality offensive players in front of him, which he did effectively against the Dallas Mavericks in the Finals.\n\nTim Bontemps of ESPN has pointed out throughout the postseason that Horford is considerably more impactful overall when he plays between 25-30 minutes. However, even when he had to play into the mid-30s or up to 40 minutes (the latter of which he did twice during the Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers), Horford proved he had enough in the tank to carry the load from the center spot.\n\nWith Horford's return confirmed by Grousbeck, the Celtics appear all but certain to bring back the top six players in their rotation.\n\nFinals MVP Jaylen Brown signed a deal that keeps him on the team through 2028. Jrue Holiday has also signed an extension through 2027. And Jayson Tatum and Porzingis are each under contract through 2025.\n\nFurthermore, Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN reported Monday night on NBA Countdown that Boston will soon offer Tatum the largest deal in league history -- one that will keep him in a Celtics uniform through the end of the decade.\n\n\"Once these NBA Finals are over, the teams are now allowed to start negotiating contract extensions and negotiating with their own free agents, which means that the Celtics will soon present Jayson Tatum with the largest contract extension in NBA history -- a five-year, $315 million extension,\" Wojnarowski said.\n\nThat leaves only Derrick White to consider, though he remains under contract through next season on a four-year deal worth $70 million that pays him north of $20 million for the 2024-25 campaign.

Horford Finally Gets His NBA Championship", "body": "On Monday, Boston Celtics big man and former Florida Gators legend Al Horford became an NBA champion for the first time in his 17-year career in the league.\u00c2\n\nDuring the 2024 NBA Finals, the 38-year-old veteran averaged 7.0 points, 6.2 rebounds and 2.6 assists per game in five games against the Dallas Mavericks.\u00c2\n\nHe becomes just the third player in Gators history to have claimed an NBA title and NCAA championship, joining Marreese Speights and Corey Brewer.\u00c2\n\nBefore eventually moving on to the NBA, Horford helped guide the Gators to back-to-back NCAA Championships in 2006 and 2007.\n\nAdditionally, he is the 10th Gator to have won the illustrious NBA title as a player.\u00c2\n\nThroughout his 17-year journey in the NBA, he has been on the Atlanta Hawks, Boston Celtics, Philadelphia 76ers and the Oklahoma City Thunder.\u00c2\n\nOver this span, Horford struggled to find his way to the finals, having to almost always deal with LeBron James and the Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference in his path to the Finals.\u00c2\n\nThen, he finally made it to the NBA Finals back in 2022 with the Celtics but lost to the Golden State Warriors 4-2 in the series.\u00c2\n\nNow, one of the greatest athletes in Florida Gators history, Al Horford is an NBA champion after taking down the Mavericks in five games.\u00c2\n\nDuring his time in the NBA, Horford has scored his fair share of points, grabbed many rebounds, dished out some assists and played tremendous defense that resulted in him seeing his name voted onto some honorable lists.\u00c2\n\nThe five-time NBA All-Star has made appearances on the All-Defensive, All-NBA and All-Rookie teams throughout his years in the association.\u00c2\n\nFurthermore, Horford has amassed over 16,000 points, 4,000 assists, 10,000 rebounds and just shy of 1,500 blocks in his 1,264 games played in the regular season and playoffs.\u00c2\n\nIn the end, this win gives him what every player looks for upon entering the league and forever marks him in the history book as an NBA champion.\u00c2", "source": {"uri": "si.com",

A dream that he had seen in an unforgettable meeting with the franchise's former GM Danny Ainge.\n\nWhile talking to the reporters in the post-game press conference, Horford narrated the story of what the then-Celtics president Danny Ainge told him in the 2016 meeting during his free agency that convinced him to join the Cs.\n\nThe former Hawks center's mind was already diverted by Wyc Grousbeck's shiny 2008 championship ring, but the president's statement assured him of his move. \"He said, 'You can win championships in many places, but there's nothing like winning in Boston. Nothing like winning as a Celtic. And that stuck with me from that meeting,\" added Horford. The Dominican got on board with the Shamrocks comfortably for the next three seasons.\n\nHorford then moved to Philadelphia and Oklahoma City before returning to Boston and finally getting his dream ring, which made him feel the truth behind Ainge's words.\n\nAppearing for 19 games in the playoffs, he contributed 9.2 points, 7.0 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game while shooting at 47.8% from the floor. After his glorious win, even the often harsh social media fans couldn't hold back their appreciation.\n\nFollowing the championship win, the official NBA page on X (FKA Twitter) shared a heartwarming video of Al Horford finally winning the trophy after a long wait. The caption read, \"He's waited 17 years for his NBA championship.\" This made the NBA community emotional, who poured in their comments showing regard to the 38-year-old.\n\nProud of Big Al's contribution, a fan commented, \"Al Horford's veteran leadership and consistent play have been crucial. From enduring many seasons without a ring to finally being an NBA Champion, his journey is inspiring. Man, I love when patience is rewarded!\"\n\n\"What a season.

By the time he strode to the podium on Monday night at TD Garden, he had yet to even process Boston's 18th title and his role in helping this team finally accomplish its end goal.\n\n\"I don't think it's sunk in yet,\" Horford said. \"I'm going through the emotions right now, but I don't feel like it's over. This is an unbelievable feeling. Yeah, the confetti, everything is going on, but it just hasn't hit me yet.\"\n\nWhile Horford was a man of few words when it came to his own contributions to Boston's title run, his teammates were more than happy to pick up the slack when it came to heaping praise on the five-time All-Star.\n\n\"Nobody deserved it more than Al,\" Jaylen Brown said. \"He's been a great not just leader on the court but off the court as well. Just a mentor. Somebody I know I can talk to about life and is going to give me great advice about family, about finances, about just life, adversity, whatever the case is. Just Al has just been that guy for me and for us.\"\n\nHorford has seen his role shift throughout his two tenures with the Celtics. Signed as a marquee free agent in 2016, Horford maintained his status as an All-Star talent from 2016-19 -- serving as a key piece on the Isaiah Thomas-led 2016 squad and continuing to anchor the front court as younger stars like Brown and Tatum started to flourish.\n\nHis second stint after arriving back in Boston in 2021 has seen him shift into more of a reserve role. But Horford's defensive contributions, evolving 3-point shot, and veteran mettle has allowed to him to hold steady as a regular contributor in Boston's rotation, even at this stage of his career.\n\nWith Kristaps Porzingis sidelined throughout the postseason with both calf and ankle injuries, Horford averaged over 30 minutes per game in each of Boston's final three playoff series against the Cavaliers, Pacers, and Mavericks.\n\nIn Boston's Game 5 win over the Mavericks on Monday, Horford added nine points and nine rebounds in over 32 minutes of action.\n\n\"Once I became his teammate, it was like one of the ultimate goals of this season,\" Jrue Holiday said. \"Knowing the type of person that Al is, knowing the leader that he is, even off the court, the father that he is, just the all-around great person and great human, I'd run through a brick wall for him. I'm so happy that he got one.\"\n\nOn a Celtics team boasting multiple stars and players who have woven themselves into the fabric of this storied franchise, it was Horford whose individual triumph garnered the most praise.\n\n\"Al is an unbelievable teammate, unbelievable person,\" Kristaps Porzingis said. \"Everybody loves him. He's a great leader.

The 38-year-old big man will return to the Boston Celtics for his 18th NBA season in 2024-25, team owner Wyc Grousbeck said during an interview on WEEI's \"The Greg Hill Show\" on Tuesday.\n\n\"Al is coming back for next year,\" Grousbeck said. \"That's what I've been told.\"\n\nGrousbeck continued: \"Ironically, we won in '08 over Al's team. The Hawks took us to seven [games] in the first round, so we were part of his drought. And now he came home to us. He loves it here. He and his family love it here. He couldn't be happier. We are all so happy.\"\n\nHorford, a five-time All-Star, accepted his role as Boston's sixth man this season after starting every single game in which he appeared for the first 17 years of his career. After Kristaps Porzingis hurt his calf in the fourth game of the playoffs, though, Horford stepped back into the starting lineup. He averaged 9.2 points and 7.0 rebounds in 30.3 minutes per game in the postseason, with a 60.9% true shooting percentage, and Boston outscored its playoff opponents by 11.4 points per 100 possessions with him on the court.\n\nIncredibly, Horford remains one of the game's most versatile bigs. He's comfortable in multiple pick-and-roll coverages, and, while his usage rate has fallen to 11.9% for the last two seasons, he is effective on offense as a floor spacer (he made 42.9% of his catch-and-shoot 3s in 2023-24 and 44.8% in 2022-23), ball mover and handoff hub. In a pinch, Horford can still get a bucket in the post or off the dribble, too.\n\nHorford is owed $9.5 million next season.

But since this franchise continued to make one mistake after another following this failure, it's important to tell it again and again, until the local NBA team finally does something right \u00ad -- you know, like the Boston Celtics have done 18 times to build championship rosters.\n\nYou know, like the one that won 64 games this year and went 16-3 in the playoffs, including winning four out of five over the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA finals.\n\nHorford is 38 years old and was second on the list of those playing in postseason games without an NBA title, with 185, until he became a champion in Boston's clinching 106-88 victory Monday night.\n\n\"It's been long -- a lot of hard work, but I'm so proud to be a part of this team,\" Horford said after the game. \"I can't believe it. I still can't believe it. We did it. We're here. I still can't believe it.\n\nThis is just how I pictured it here at The Garden with our fans, everybody together, this is just how I saw it eight years ago.\n\n\"It's special when you're here at the Garden,\" he said. \"This is something I just don't take for granted. The energy of the fans. Our fans, they love the Celtics. They want us to play hard, they want us to play the right way. And I just felt very connected with them tonight, with the way that we were playing, that we got it going.\"\n\nIf that sounds familiar to you, it may be because this was one of the reasons that his father Tito gave when he chose Boston over Washington eight years ago as a sought-after free agent.\n\n\"There wasn't as much motivation for him when he (Al) saw all the empty seats when they (Washington) were winning,\" Tito said. \"He said to me, 'Dad, when we were playing Boston, they were down 15 points and they were cheering their team like they were winning the game. They're so into the game.' This is special for us, especially for him.\"\n\nIt was a double dose of failure for Washington -- Horford spurning the Wizards and then going to a division rival in a four-year, $113 million deal with the Celtics. It smacked them right in the face when the Wizards faced Horford in the Eastern Conference semifinals and lost in seven games. Horford averaged 17 points and 6.6 rebounds in seven games against the Wizards in that series. He spent four years with Boston, followed by stints with Philadelphia and Oklahoma City before returning to the Celtics in 2021.\n\nReminders of the ineptitude of the Wizards were hard to miss in this Celtics championship run -- in addition to Horford, who never wore a Washington jersey, there was Kristap Porzingis, who averaged 20 points a game for Boston, and, though, injured for much of the finals, set the tone for the Celtics in Game 1 with 20 points, six rebounds and three blocked shots.\n\nIt's hard to believe that Porzingis spent parts of two seasons in Washington, averaging 23 points a night \u00ad -- and yet they won only 35 games in each of those years.\n\nIt's almost like it never happened.\n\n\"Man, it feels great to be a champion,\" Porzingis told reporters after the game.\n\nThis is history. The Wizards have entered a new era, under the direction of new team president Michael Winger and general manager Will Dawkins, and hope to build a winner like the Celtics, though that's not exactly the blueprint. Boston drafted its two big stars, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, with the third picks in the 2016 and 2017 NBA drafts while still winning 53 and 55 games, thanks to trades for those picks by then-GM Danny Ainge.\n\nWashington won just 15 games this past season to get the second pick in the upcoming draft. It's going to be much more painful. Then again, watching Al Horford celebrating his NBA championship should have been painful. It's all been painful for a very long time.\n\nYou can hear Thom Loverro on The Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thom_loverro@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Thom Loverro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Wizards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Wizards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Ainge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Danny Ainge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Block (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/06/18/NBA_Finals_Basketball_47401_c0-212-5086-3177_s1770x1032.jpg?25597f67b17cc21661d88fc32d908a1810630047", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660502", "eventUri": "eng-9660502", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

But it wasn't until Monday, his 186th playoff game, that he won a championship.\n\n\"This is for my family, their support has always been with me,\" said Horford in Spanish in a postgame press conference. \"And for the Dominican people because I know that I have a lot of people there who love me, who follow me, who have always been with me, and I feel really proud to represent all Dominicans.\"\n\nHorford, 38, was born in Puerto Plata on the island's coast. He attended high school in Michigan and played college basketball for the University of Florida. His dad Tito Horford, a former NBA player, was the first Dominican-born player drafted in the league back in 1988.\n\nAl Horford played nine years for the Atlanta Hawks before joining the Celtics in 2016. After the 2019 season, he left to play for the Philadelphia 76ers and Oklahoma City Thunder, before returning to Boston in 2021.\n\nHe has always been a fan favorite in Boston, which is home to the second-largest Dominican population in Massachusetts, following Lawrence, The Boston Globe reported earlier this year. Collectively, Dominicans own more than 500 businesses and contribute around $202.2 million to the economy. With more than 175,000 Dominican residents in the state, Massachusetts has the fourth largest population in the country.\n\nHorford thanked every Dominican -- in the island and abroad -- who has cheered him on, but he gave special thanks to those in Boston. \"They have been very supportive. Lawrence, Jamaica Plain, Lynn -- se les quiere,\" he said. \"I give you my love.\"\n\nIn Jamaica Plain, salsa music blared in Fern\u00e1ndez Beauty and Barber Shop the day after the win. Photos of famous baseball players hung on the wall, but in their company was a shot of Horford reaching for the net -- ball in hand -- in a Celtics uniform.\n\nBut that photo isn't hung just because Juan Fern\u00e1ndez, owner of the shop, is a Celtics fan. For five years, he was the one to give Horford his cuts, he said. And the chair he sits clients on was a gift from the champion.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez, who immigrated from Dominican Republic in 1992, started his business in 1996. He said he met Horford through Dominican Red Sox super star David Ortiz.\n\n\"I knew we were going to win,\" said Fern\u00e1ndez, in Spanish, of the game. \"I feel really proud of him and for all Dominicans.\"\n\nJos\u00e9 Luis Sosa, a barber in Brighton, said that while he's a fan of the Sox and the Celtics, he roots more for the basketball team.\n\n\"I wanted the Celtics to win . . . because of Horford,\" Sosa said in Spanish. Plus, Sosa and Horford share the same hometown on the island.\n\nJulia Mejia was born in the Caribbean nation, and she is the first Dominican to sit on the Boston City Council.\n\n\"The energy around here, out in the streets -- we're all very, super proud of him,\" Mejia said. \"But also [proud about] what it means. He's putting Dominicans on the map. It's not just the fact that we won, but that there's a Dominican [who] won for the first time\" and is \"part of the story.\"\n\nMejia said Horford's win and embrace of Latino culture goes a long way for representation.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type":

The Boston Celtics -- who won the NBA championship on Monday night -- certainly saw their value.\n\nThe presence of both Horford and Tillman, in some ways, explains these Celtics -- deep, battle-tested, selfless, full of complementary players who understand their roles and players whose greatest strength is enhancing their team's chances of winning.\n\nThat's been Horford and Tillman forever.\n\nHorford, a son of Lansing and Grand Ledge High School, is still an effective player at age 38, starting most of these playoffs as center Kristaps Porzingis has dealt with lower leg injuries. Horford might not defend as he once did, but his acumen on both ends, ability to see the what's transpiring at a high level and stretch a defense with his shot, makes him a savvy and serviceable starter and ideal backup center for a team with title aspirations. He's played 30 minutes a night in these playoffs, averaging 9.2 points, 7.0 rebounds, 2.1 assists and hitting close to two 3-pointers per game in 19 games.\n\nTillman, an MSU legend and Grand Rapids native, has played in eight of the Celtics' 19 playoff games this season, three times reaching doubles figures in minutes and three times playing important minutes in close games -- none more prominent than Game 3 of the NBA Finals, when he memorably hit a corner 3-pointer (his only shot), hauled in four rebounds and blocked two shots in 11 minutes, while often defending Dallas star Luka Doncic on switches. That ability -- something we saw him master at MSU -- is why the Celtics went to Tillman in that game with Porzingis out. He's turned himself into a valuable insurance policy, which is why Boston traded for him in February.\n\nIronically, the player the Celtics sent to Memphis (along with two second-round picks) for Tillman, former Penn State star Lamar Stevens, was one of the four Big Ten stars Tillman proved his defensive versatility against during the notable final fews games of his MSU career.\n\nMORE: Couch: Where Xavier Tillman ranks among Michigan State's all-time greats\n\n\"We've always liked Xavier,\" Celtics president Brad Stevens told reporters at the time of the trade. \"He is, obviously, big and strong (and) moves his feet well laterally, so he's been able to guard a number of people at a number of different positions well. Above that, he plays the game for the right reasons. He competes, he passes, thinks the game well, all the stuff that we've been fortunate with the guys we have around our best players, that they've brought to the table; he knows how to play.\"\n\nNot so different than Horford in that sense.\n\nAmong the reasons the Celtics made a trade to reaquire Horford in 2021, Stevens said: \"(He) has a good feel for not only playing with our guys, but also has made them better. ... The ability to space, pass, play in different ways and play in different coverages at the other end.\"\n\nUntil Monday, an NBA title was about all that eluded Horford -- a 2004 Grand Ledge graduate who won two national championships at the University of Florida in his three years there. In league history, only Karl Malone had played in more NBA playoff games than Horford without winning it all.\n\n\"I don't think it's sunk in yet,\" Horford told the Boston Globe on Monday night. \"I'm going through the emotions right now, but I don't feel like it's over. The confetti [is falling], everything is going on, but it just hasn't hit me yet.\"\n\nRELATED: Al Horford is an NBA champion. Finally.\n\nA player as devoted to and as successful at winning as Horford deserves to taste an NBA championship. Only twice in a 17-year career with the Hawks, Celtics, Sixers and Oklahoma City has Horford's team failed to win more than half of its games -- his rookie season in Atlanta and his lone year with the Thunder, when he barely played. In 10 seasons, his teams have won more than 60% of their games, including this season in Boston, which went 64-18 in the regular season and then 16-3 in the playoffs.\n\nHe's a five-time all-star who, at his peak, twice averaged more than 17 points per game and, for six seasons, hovered around double-digit rebounds per night. As his rebounding numbers declined slightly later in his career, he four times averaged four assists per game or better. Once a borderline headliner, he's settled perfectly in the role of complementary player, ideal for a Celtics team with Jason Tatum and Jaylen Brown and other guards, wings and shooters who need him to be someone who helps glue it all together.\n\n\"He gave everything to this team,\" Porzingis said of Horford to the Globe. \"He deserves it more than anybody.\"\n\nHis career is far more accomplished than Tillman's. But their are similarities -- their on-court intelligence, ability to explain the game, the understanding and execution of their roles, the addition a 3-point shot after the beginning of their NBA careers. They are desired as teammates, which, for Tillman, along with his notable defensive abilities, will likely keep him on winning NBA rosters for a decade.\n\nJaylen Brown's interesting Lansing ties\n\nCeltics' wing and NBA Finals MVP Jaylen Brown, like Horford and Tillman, has some ties to both Lansing and MSU. Brown's father, Marselles, played basketball and boxed at Lansing Community College in the late 1980s and then fought out of Lansing for a while, with the title of the world's tallest heavyweight, at 6-foot-11 with an 86-inch reach. Marselles, who grew up in Ohio before coming to Lansing, fought four world champions, including Tommy Morrison (after a break to attend MSU), during a notable career, which early on included a number of fights at Lansing's Civic Center.", "source": {"uri": "freep.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Detroit Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

What a great pride for our country! Congratulations on your incredible achievement. #DominicanPride,\" wrote President Luis Abidnader in his post on Twitter/X.\n\nHorford, and the Celtics' glorious victory, had crowds cheering 1,600-miles away in the DR and also a short trip away from Boston in the city of Lawrence where a majority of residents of Dominican descent.\n\nState Rep. Francisco Paulino, who is Dominican, said seeing Horford win was a \"milestone that filled me with immense pride.\"\n\n\"Al's story is one of hard work, resilience and dedication - qualities that resonate deeply within our community,\" said Paulino.\n\n\"His success not only showcases his exceptional talent but also serves as a powerful reminder of what can be achieved through perseverance and commitment,\" Paulino continued.\n\nA father of five children, Horford, 38, was surrounded by his family on the parquet floor at TD Garden following the win. He held two of his daughters, both of whom waved Dominican flags. Horford plays power forward and center.\n\n\"Glory to the Lord. I can't believe it. It doesn't seem real to me,\" said Horford, in a postgame interview.\n\nHorford also said he felt proud \"to represent all the Dominicans, no just over there, but in the world because I know they're in different places in Europe and here in the United States,\" said Horford, who had a Dominican flag tucked in his waistband while posing for photos.\n\nHis father, Tito Horford, was the first Dominican to make the NBA in 1988 and played in 63 games total with the Bucks and Washington Bullets.\n\nIn 2003 at age 18, Al's future wife, Amelia Vega, became the first Dominican to win the Miss Universe pageant.\n\nReferred to as a \"Dominican icon,\" Horford is considered the greatest Dominican basketball player of all time.\n\n\"He is amazing and we are very proud of him,\" said Wendy Luzon, a Lawrence city councilor and business owner.\n\nHorford and his family are devout Christians who are committed to giving back, she said.\n\n\"He is a great human being besides being a great basketball player,\" said Luzon, who stressed what a positive role model Horford is for children.\n\nState Sen. Pavel Payano, D-Lawrence, also lauded the player's accomplishments.\n\nHorford \" embodies the dreams of not just of an athlete, but of everyone who has dared to reach for greatness. As the first Dominican elected to serve in the Massachusetts Senate, I see Al's triumph as a triumph of the Dominican American community.\"\n\n\"His victory resonates deeply in the heart of Lawrence, a city rich in culture and spirit. Al did not just lift a trophy, he lifted the aspirations of every child in our community. This is more than a game won, it's a barrier broken and a proud moment for the Dominican community,\" Payano said.\n\nHorford, along with teammate Jaylen Brown, visited a Lawrence middle school in 2017.\n\nAfter the visit, he said he was impressed with how engaged the students were and he encouraged them to be \"good people and role models in their communities.\"\n\n\"That's what it's all about, if we can have some sort of impact and just help the community be better, and just really give the kids confidence and encourage them to do the right thing,\" he said.\n\nPaulino said Horford stands \"as a prime example of what is possible, bringing immense pride to the Dominican Republic and inspiring us all.\"\n\nFollow staff reporter Jill Harmacinski on Twitter @EagleTribJill.",

The fact that it has come, it has happened -- JT, JB stepping up in a big way and leading us -- it's special.\"\n\nIt was Ainge who traded Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett, the final vestiges of Boston's last championship, for a cache of draft picks from the Brooklyn Nets in 2013. Two became Tatum and Brown. And it was Horford who served as their veteran, taking each to an Eastern Conference finals in their rookie seasons.\n\n\"Al Horford is a real-life legend and hero,\" said Brown. \"It's been great to be his teammate.\"\n\nThe three of them, more than anyone else on this roster, are Celtics. Not just in the sense that they have played in Boston. They have won here now. They are in the club. Their numbers will be retired in the rafters of TD Garden, alongside the championship banner. Alongside Russell and Cousy, Havlicek and Cowens, Bird and McHale, there will be Tatum and Brown. And make no mistake: There will be Horford, too. He is one of them now.\n\nAs the minutes passed on Boston's blowout, close-out victory, 2008 Celtics champion Eddie House turned to this reporter and said, \"Hey, Yahoo Sports, write this down: That is 18 of them now. You see him,\" he said, pointing to 1981 NBA Finals MVP Cedric Maxwell, \"and me,\" he added, \"and them,\" pointing to the parquet floor, where Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla was pulling his starters one by one from the game.\n\n\"We're all champions,\" said House.\n\nThis is what it means to be a member of the Celtics. All season long, Boston's rallying cry has been \"DIFFERENT HERE,\" and it is. There is a brotherhood that runs through the history of the league, lined with championship rings, and everyone on this year's roster -- from Jrue Holiday, Derrick White and Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is to Sam Hauser, Luke Kornet and Oshae Brissett -- has become a member for life.\n\nNone more so than Tatum and Brown, who are only scratching the surface of their legacies in Boston.\n\n\"We've been through a lot,\" said Brown, who captured Finals MVP over Tatum by a 7-4 vote. \"We've been playing together for seven years now. We've been through a lot, the losses, the expectations. The media have said all different types of things: 'We can't play together. We are never going to win.' We heard it all. But we just blocked it out, and we just kept going. I trusted him. He trusted me. And we did it together.\"\n\nAt 26 and 27 years old, respectively, Tatum and Brown spoke as if this was forever in the making, though they know it was longer for Horford. It only feels like forever because of how much adversity their Celtics have navigated -- six Eastern Conference finals in Brown's eight seasons, five losses, including last year's embarrassment against the Miami Heat, and a blown 2-1 Finals lead to the Golden State Warriors in 2022.\n\n\"But all of those experiences led to here,\" said Brown. \"All of the moments where we came up short, we felt like we let the city down, let ourselves down, is how we get to this moment. And it makes it feel even that much better that we had to go through all the journey, the heartbreak, the embarrassment, the loss, to get to the mountaintop. It's great. And shout out to all the supporters and the city of Boston.\"\n\nThose losses take on a different light now that they have won. Gone is the criticism. After all those blown opportunities, dwindling leads that left everyone wondering if they were built for this, if Tatum and Brown could coexist, nobody can take this title away. They were built for it. They are coexisting -- as champions.\n\nNow, we are left to wonder what's left that they can accomplish. Now, we look back on all of those playoff losses and see playoff scars, healed over. Now, we see all they have done -- 235 playoff games between them, more than most anyone ever their age -- and must acknowledge mounting Hall of Fame r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. Now, they are surpassing Celtics records held by legends, and you must accept they belong among them.\n\n\"They get scrutinized so much, and they get so much pressure put on them for not winning or making it to the Eastern Conference finals [six times in eight years], or even making it to the Finals and not getting over that hump,\" said Holiday. \"I feel like people finally see the relationship that they have. They see that from the beginning, they have always done it together. They have never compared against each other. They have always been joyful and happy for each other. ... Hopefully it's a burden off of their shoulders.\n\n\"But another burden is doing it again.\"\n\nThe only legacy discussion now is how much these Celtics can add to it. Their playoff rotation is signed through next season, and it will be hard for any of them to leave Boston now that they never have to buy another drink in the city again. The only question is whether they can add more banners to the rafters.\n\n\"It took being relentless,\" said Tatum. \"It took being on the other side of this and losing in the Finals and being at literally the lowest point in a basketball career that you could be, to next year, to the following year, thinking that was going to be the time, and coming up short again. People have said it before, but coming up short and having failures makes this moment that much better. Because you know what it feels like to lose. You know what it feels like to be on the other side of this and be in the locker room and hearing the other team celebrating, hearing them celebrate on your home floor. That was devastating.\n\n\"And now, to elevate yourself in a space that all your favorite players are in, everybody that they consider greats or legends have won a championship, and all of the guys I looked up to won a championship -- multiple championships. So now I can, like, walk in those rooms and be a part of that. It's a hell of a feeling. This is more,\" he said, pausing, \"I dreamed about what it would be like, but this is 10 times better.\"\n\nThis one is forever. The next one? This city expects it. That is just how it is here, and nobody understands that better than Horford and the two rising legends he mentored to this point. They are Bostonians now.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_rohrbach@aol.com", "name": "Ben Rohrbach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

The Celtics capturing the 2024 title took Horford off an ignominious list, as Boston coming up short this year would have almost certainly (eventually) vaulted him past Karl Malone (193) for most career playoff games without a championship.\n\nAfter the game, Horford was understandably excited to finally get his first ring, 17 years into his NBA career:\n\nBut with Horford winning a championship, James Harden ended up taking a crown no player wants: His 166 career playoff games without a ring is now not just fourth all-time in NBA history, but the most of any active NBA player.\n\nPer StatMuse, the next closest is... his former Rockets teammate Chris Paul, with 149.\n\nWith the NBA Finals over, Harden is now eligible -- under a new NBA rule going into place this year -- to begin talking with the Clippers about a new contract to keep him in Los Angeles in free agency. Given that franchise's historic playoff woes, it seems unlikely Harden will end his reign atop a leaderboard that no current NBA player wants to sit on, but there is a small silver lining: At least, at age 34, he's unlikely to go on enough long playoff runs in Los Angeles to pass Malone or John Stockton (182) for a top-two slot on the all-time ranking.\n\nThat's something, right?\n\nWhile maybe Harden can do some title chasing to end his career to put this record to bed, at least as of right now, the self-described \"winner\" appears poised to hang onto that bit of infamy for a while.\n\nBut hey, at least maybe he appears poised to get a different type of ring soon!", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harrison_faigen@sbnation.com", "name": "Harrison Faigen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stockton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Stockton"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UWO5xdA2UxfN2prBoEGWADXXfBw=/0x0:8460x4230/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25495819/2059715685.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660502", "eventUri": "eng-9660502", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The Boston Celtics veteran big man has been a staple of the Celtics' rotation during his two stints with the franchise. He has played the role of veteran leader and reliable on-court presence to perfection. Now, he will always be remembered as a core part of Boston's championship puzzle.\n\nHorford turned 38 on June 3. He will be 39 by the end of the 2024-25 season. However, Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck recently confirmed that the veteran will be returning to the Celtics for another season. Horford has one year remaining on his current contract. The chance to challenge for a repeat has likely been a factor in his decision-making.\n\n\"Al is coming back for next year. That's what I've been told.

Going professional made him have big stints with the Atlanta Hawks, Oklahoma City Thunder, and Philadelphia 76ers. But, it was the Boston Celtics that gave him shot to finally have a complete career by winning the NBA Finals. He might have departed from the Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum-led squad for quite some time but his return was crucial in helping Joe Mazzulla bring home the franchise's 18th banner.\n\nAl Horford just needed a Larry O'Brien trophy to round out a legendary career. With their 122 to 84 win against the Dallas Mavericks in Game 5 of the NBA Finals, he finally did it. The veteran is also not going home without breaking NBA Finals history.\n\nAl Horford is the first champion to be older than his head coach since 1969, per HoopsHype. He is 38 years old and Joe Mazzulla is three years younger than him. Poetically, the Celtics also had the last and only other pairing in NBA Finals history to have achieved this accolade. It was Bill Russell and Buddy Jeannette who notched it back in their 1969 title run.\n\nMoreover, Joe Mazzulla is also the second-youngest head coach to win the NBA Finals. The only other person who did it at a younger age? Well, it was also the late Bill Russell when he was 34 while Mazzulla reached basketball immortality a year older.\n\nAll of this makes for a weird stat in NBA Finals history. Typically, the coaches are older and former players in the league who develop young guys. But, Mazzulla is not one of these. He did not play in the league and the funny thing is he won against Jason Kidd, a prominent point guard who transitioned into coaching after his career.\n\nA hard road to an NBA Finals with the Celtics\n\nHorford's veteran leadership should also not be discounted. The Celtics big man has been with the team since the 2016 season. He is so good with the Celtics that other teams would not see his optimal production when they acquired him, just ask the Thunder and 76ers.\n\nHe already has his All-Star selections and even earned the first seed with the Hawks. It was this title with Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum that made his resume complete. To no one's surprise, he was ecstatic after holding the Larry O'Brien trophy for the first time in his career.\n\nI can't believe it. I still can't believe it. We did it, we're here, and I can't believe it. This is just how I pictured it, here at the Garden, with our fans, everybody together. This is just how I saw it. Eight years ago. This is how I saw it eight years ago. Wyc knows about it, Wyc knows about the ring. Eight years ago!\n\nThere are a lot of reasons for the Celtics to celebrate.

Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports / Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe 2023-2024 NBA season has officially concluded. On Monday night, the Philadelphia 76ers watched their rival team take on the trophy.\n\nWith another dominant win over the Dallas Mavericks, the Boston Celtics collected Game 5, making the 2024 NBA Finals a gentleman's sweep.\n\nAll year long the Celtics have dominated the NBA, especially the Eastern Conference. After finishing the regular season off with a 64-18 record, Boston was 14 games ahead of the second-place New York Knicks.\n\nIn the playoffs, the Celtics didn't run into many issues on their path to the NBA Finals. And once they got there, they didn't look back. For the first time since 2008, the Celtics wrap up their postseason crowned as the NBA Champions.\n\nOn Monday night, a handful of former Sixers won the title with Philly's rival.\n\nNot Holiday's first rodeo. Although Holiday's time with the Sixers didn't lead to a ton of winning, Philly's former 17th overall pick went from a bright spot on a bad team to becoming a key contributor to not one, but now two title-winning teams.\n\nAfter three seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks, Holiday was traded to the Celtics last summer. It turned out to be a key move that helped the Celtics get to the next level. During Boston's 19-game postseason run, Holiday averaged 13 points, six rebounds, and four assists while shooting 40 percent from beyond the arc. His defense remained an important factor for the run.\n\nWith his latest Finals win, the former Sixer is now a two-time champ.\n\nThe recent years have been Horford's second stint with the Celtics. After he spent a few seasons in Boston, Horford shocked the NBA when he joined the 76ers in 2019 with a near-max deal. To refer to Horford's time with the Sixers as infamous would be an understatement.\n\nIn his lone season with the Sixers, Horford averaged 12 points, seven rebounds, and four assists. In the playoffs, where Horford was expected to make a major impact, he averaged seven points and seven rebounds. The Sixers were swept by the Celtics that year.\n\nSince returning to Boston, Horford hasn't exactly flipped a switch and reverted back to his prime form, but he's been a major piece to Boston's success. This postseason, Horford produced nine points and seven rebounds per game while knocking down 37 percent of his threes. Being in the league since 2007, Horford finally has his first championship.\n\nThis year was Springer's first run with the Celtics, and it started halfway through the season. The Sixers made a handful of moves at the 2024 trade deadline, and one of them included packaging Springer to the Celtics for a second-round pick.\n\nAt the time, the move came as a shock considering Springer was just Daryl Morey's second first-round selection since he took over Philly's front office in 2020.

He has always been a widely respected player and has helped lead his teams to 15 playoff berths.\n\nHe also won two national titles during his college career with the Florida Gators, another feather in his cap.\n\nThe argument against him is that he's never truly been one of the elite players in the sport. His career averages of 13.1 points, eight rebounds and 1.2 blocks per game don't exactly leap off the page, and even in his prime years he never averaged more than 18.6 points per game and only tallied double-digit rebounds per game once, in the 2012-13 season.\n\nHorford's longevity and his contributions to teams that consistently find themselves in the playoffs will likely get him in.

Malone also reached the Finals in his last NBA season with the Los Angeles Lakers, but they were upended by the Detroit Pistons.\n\nIt comes as little surprise that Malone's longtime Jazz teammate, fellow Hall of Famer John Stockton, is now second on the list since the Jazz reached the playoffs every season of his 19-year career.\n\nGiven that Harden is 34 and still playing quality basketball, it is not outside the realm of possibility that he could surpass both Stockton and Malone on the all-time list of playoff games played without a championship.\n\nDuring his 15-year career with the Oklahoma City Thunder, Houston Rockets, Brooklyn Nets, Philadelphia 76ers and Clippers, Harden has reached the playoffs all 15 times, making it as far as the NBA Finals once.\n\nHarden is among the most accomplished offensive players of his era, having earned 10 All-Star selections, three scoring titles and an NBA MVP Award, but an NBA championship continues to elude him.\n\nSince Harden's career playoff numbers of 22.7 points, 6.4 assists and 5.5 rebounds per game, while shooting 42.5 percent from the field lag behind his career regular-season production, Harden has gained the reputation for not being a playoff performer.\n\nWinning one title can change the entire narrative, but if that doesn't happen, Harden may retire as the poster boy for playoff futility.", "source":

Mandatory Credit: Eric Hartline-USA TODAY Sports\n\nJames Harden can't be too pleased with the result of this year's NBA Finals.\n\nThe Boston Celtics officially won the NBA championship on Monday night, defeating the Dallas Mavericks in five games. One notable storyline was that 38-year-old Celtics big man Al Horford won his first career title. Horford had gone 17 seasons in the NBA and 186 total playoff games before finally securing his ring.\n\nThe five-time All-Star Horford had held the unpleasant honor of the most career playoff games by an active player without a championship. But now that he is officially out of that club, the shameful honor belongs to the LA Clippers guard Harden, who has played in 166 career playoff games and counting without a title.\n\nHarden, now 34, has come close several times. He made the NBA Finals with the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2012 and also later made conference finals appearances with the Houston Rockets in 2015 and 2018 ... but fell short every single time.\n\nOn the bright side for Harden, Karl Malone (193), John Stockton (181), and Sam Perkins (167) still have more all-time playoff games without a title. The former MVP Harden also has some time left as he is still playing at a high level with averages of 16.6 points and 8.5 assists per game this year for the Clippers. But Harden, who will be an unrestricted free agent this summer, has to decide if he will continue to pursue that elusive championship with the Clippers, who are in a very interesting situation right now.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darryn_albert@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Darryn Albert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Center_(Philadelphia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stockton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Stockton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Perkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Perkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/James-Harden-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660502", "eventUri": "eng-9660502", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-02-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

No other player in NBA history had logged more postseason games without winning a title than Horford, making the 38-year-old all more appreciative of the much-anticipated experience of being covered in confetti and champagne.\n\nHorford feels especially appreciative, however, for the Boston faithful.\n\n\"I just wanna tell them thank you, I just wanna tell them I appreciate them,\" Horford told reporters during a meet-and-greet in Boston's Raising Canes restaurant on Boylston Street on Wednesday, per CLNS Media. \"We play basketball for the Celtics, but we understand we represent much more; Boston, we represent the New England area and I'm just very proud to bring a championship to Boston. When I came here eight years ago, this was kind of what I envisioned and it's been hard, it's been a lot of hard work. A lot of tough losses over the years but just to get to this point, I'm very grateful.\"\n\nWhen teammate and starting center Kristaps Porzingis went down, suffering a calf injury in the first round against the Miami Heat, Horford, at now 38 years of age, answered the call. He notched a 22-point, 15-rebound double-double in Game 5 of the semifinal round to eliminate the Cleveland Cavaliers and drained a career-high seven 3-pointers in Game 3 of the conference finals -- scoring 25 points -- en route to eliminating the Indiana Pacers.\n\nHorford averaged 9.2 points with seven rebounds and 2.1 assists, shooting 47.8% from the field and 36.8% from three, splitting the successful postseason hunt by starting and playing off the bench as the team's sixth man.\n\nKnowing how much it would mean to get a title added to Horford's already-elite career resume, the team felt motivated. Horford's reaching the tail-end of his career -- currently under contract for $9.5 million next season -- therefore, the race against Father Time was closing in. Yet, pushing the five-time All-Star to more considerable Hall of Fame territory was just another perk for raising Banner 18 to Horford's Celtics teammates.\n\n\"Knowing the type of person that Al is, knowing the leader that he is, even off the court, the father that he is, just the all-around great person and great human, I'd run through a brick wall for him,\" Jrue Holiday said after Boston's series-clinching Game 5 win. \"I'm so happy that he got one.\"\n\nHorford, who skipped out on Boston's title-winning celebration trip to Miami, is soaking in the experience of being a champion. On Friday, Horford will rejoin Celtics teammates for a duck boat parade across Boston before the team transitions into the offseason and prepares to strive for another one.\n\n\"I feel like we're just really caught up in looking at the pictures, looking at videos, just trying to take it along with my family,\" Horford added, per CLNS Media. \"Just kind of sharing stories of the night and things like that. That's kind of what we've been doing.\"", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gio_rivera@nesn.com", "name": "Gio Rivera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_man", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sixth man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/06/Al-Horford-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660502", "eventUri": "eng-9660502", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 456620834, "relevance": 2}

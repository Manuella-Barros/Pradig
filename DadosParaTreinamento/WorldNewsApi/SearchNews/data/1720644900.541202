{"id": 231308664, "title": "Record-breaking Craig Gordon breaks silence on Scotland Euro 2024 snub and runs through his four goals", "text": "Craig Gordon has admitted that his record-breaking 75th Scotland appearance was \u201cextremely emotional\u201d after being informed that he would not be part of the nation\u2019s Euro 2024 squad just 24 hours. The 41-year-old Hearts goalkeeper surpassed David Weir as Scotland\u2019s oldest international after replacing Angus Gunn in the 70th minute of Friday\u2019s 2-2 draw against Finland for his first appearance for the national team since suffering a double leg fracture on Christmas Eve 2022. Gordon was visibly emotional as he came on to a standing ovation and the night did not go to plan as Scotland lost a 2-0 lead to draw with the Finns in their final warm-up game before the European Championship opener against Germany in Munich next Friday, with Gordon conceding a contentious penalty when he appeared to get the ball first in a collision. Writing on his Instagram account, Gordon was able to reflect on his journey over the past 18 months since breaking his leg at Tannadice against Dundee United. \u201cI set myself four goals,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe first was to be out of pain. The seriousness of the break made for complications and further procedures. I went through a lot of pain and wanted to be able to live life without it. I did that. The second thing I wanted to achieve was to be back on my feet and able to run around the garden and play football with my children. We\u2019ve done that. Many, many times and they won\u2019t let me stop now. \u201cThe third goal I had was to play for Hearts again. This meant a lot to me. I did that competitively in January, having played my first friendly in November, 10 months after I broke my leg. It was a long wait, but I was ready to play the rest of the season. The last thing I hoped to do was to make the Scotland squad again. And to put myself in a position to be at the Euros. Coming into the provisional squad I knew I hadn\u2019t got the games I needed so I trained harder, I trained well and felt, and still feel, very good. I am of course, so disappointed not to be there. \u201cPlaying again for Scotland last night meant I did what I set out to do. And while it wasn\u2019t in the way I wanted, I could never turn down the opportunity to play at Hampden again. Something I have had the honour of doing for over 20 years. The circumstances were tough, it was an extremely emotional night for my family and I. But I\u2019m grateful I got that opportunity. To become the oldest player to play for Scotland, it\u2019s a special record. \u201cGiven how long I\u2019ve been doing this, I\u2019ve experienced so much and I, probably more than others, know all too well, that things don\u2019t always go your way. Decisions go against you. Last night, of all nights, I wished they didn\u2019t but if a nervous 21-year-old could have seen that so many years on, through some big challenges, I\u2019d be there at 41 years old, I think I\u2019d be very happy with that. I should have been given a smaller shirt on my debut(!), but I knew that if I played for the badge on the front, people would remember the name on the back. \u201cI hope I\u2019ve done that, and will continue to do so for as long as I feel good enough. 75 caps. Thank you.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Goalkeeper is now the oldest man to play for this country</p>", "url": "https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/craig-gordon-breaks-4658432", "image": "https://www.scotsman.com/jpim-static/image/2024/06/08/15/04/21085249.jpg.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:03:23", "author": "Mark Atkinson", "authors": ["Mark Atkinson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.086}

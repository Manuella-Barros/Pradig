Germany, meanwhile, dominated Group B, posting a trio of double-digit victories over Japan, Brazil, and France.\n\nWhile Greece will have the best player on the floor in the form of Giannis Antetokounmpo, it's the considerably deeper Germans who are sizable favorites in Tuesday's Greece vs Germany odds.\n\nGermany is currently a 7.5-point favorite and -310 on the moneyline to win straight-up. Greece comes back a sa +250 underdog to advance to the semifinals.\n\nThe game total is sitting at 161.5. Germany's first three games averaged 163 PPG while Greece's averaged just 158.\n\nOdds as of Aug. 4. See the best available sportsbook promo codes to bet on the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nFor Germany, the round-robin was a Dennis Schroder showcase. The 30-year-old, who's already bounced around to seven different teams during his 11-season NBA tenure, has played arguably the best basketball of his life during the 2024 Olympics. Schroder is averaging 19.7 PPG on 54.8% shooting from the field (23 of 42) while also dishing out 9.0 assists per game.\n\nSchroder and Franz Wagner tied with a game-high 26 points apiece in Germany's 85-71 rout of host France in their final game of group play, which cemented their position as the top team in Group B and kept them on the opposite side of the bracket as Team USA (which enters the quarterfinals as a -600 favorite to win gold).\n\nAfter losing their first two games of group play to Canada (Greece gutted out a (86-79) and Spain (84-77), Greece gutted out a 77-71 victory over favored Australia to keep their Olympic dream alive.\n\nGiannis, as expected, has been the heart and soul of the team. He had 34 points in a losing effort against Canada and added another 27 in the loss to Spain before a solid 20-point, seven-round. six-assist performance in the low-scoring win over Australia.\n\nPlayer props from DraftKings on Aug 4. Lock in a DraftKings Sportsbook promo to bet on Greece vs Germany on Tuesday.\n\nTo no one's surprise, Giannis leads the player props at 28.5 points. Franz Wagner has the highest total among Germany players at 20.5 followed closely by Schroder at 18.5. Schroder is also tied for the highest assist total at 7.5 alongside Greek point guard Nick Calathes.\n\nThis line opened at 6.5 and has been steadily climbing. Germany has been undeniably impressive in this tournament so far, but Greece kept both of its losses within seven points. In a 40-minute game against Giannis, it's difficult to create too big of a gap.\n\nI don't expect Greece to pull off an upset here; the Germans are far too deep with NBA talent. But I will be very surprised if the feisty, slow-tempo Greeks let the score get out of hand.\n\nGreece vs Germany picks:", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sascha_paruk@sportsbettingdime.com", "name": "Sascha Paruk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Schr\u00f6der", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dennis Schr\u00f6der"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Round-robin tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Wagner_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franz Wagner (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Calathes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Calathes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.sportsbettingdime.com/app/uploads/media/4/USATSI_23895786.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792328", "eventUri": "eng-9792328", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 68, "textEnd": 76}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 1051, "textEnd": 1057, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

They were hardly challenged en route to the quarterfinals, winning by an average of 15.7 points. Their +47 point differential was second only to the Americans.\n\nThey've been paced by the backcourt play of Dennis Schroder and Franz Wagner. Schroder is averaging 19.7 points and nine dimes, while Wagner leads the team in scoring at 21.7 points while adding five rebounds, two assists, 1.7 steals, and one block.\n\nGermany is averaging 89.3 points per game, ranking third. They are hitting at a sharp 60.7% from 2-point range and a respectable 37.9% from distance, both of which rank Top 4 of the teams left standing.\n\nAnd yet, it wouldn't be a total shocker if Germany were to fall to Greece -- a team that had just one win in the group stage and needed to sneak in on point differential. That's how good Giannis Antetokounmpo can be on any given night.\n\nThe Greek Freak leads the Olympics in scoring at 27 points per game while ranking inside the Top 4 in minutes played. He's also Top 8 in rebounds (7.7).\n\nHis 15 shot attempts per game leads the tournament, and he's hitting at a ridiculous 68.9% clip. Nobody ranked ahead of him has attempted more than 16 field goals over three games.\n\nThat star power has been enough to keep the Greeks within striking distance all tournament. While they knocked off Australia 77-71, they also lost by just seven points to the Canadians and by six to the Spaniards.\n\nGermany has a frontline that can at least throw live bodies at him, including the likes of Mo Wagner, Isaac Bonga and Daniel Theiss, and that depth should be key in helping Germany advance. Still, Antetokounmpo's determination should help keep his team in range.\n\nAfter lighting Canada on fire in the opener with 34 points on 11-for-17 shooting from the field, Giannis has been great, but not totally all-world since. His point total prop is simply too high.\n\nHe tallied 27 points, 11 rebounds and three assists against Spain on 12-for-17 shooting, then closed the knockout stage with 20 points, seven boards and six assists against Australia.\n\nThose six dimes were a tourney-best for him, and Germany will likely lean into this formula, hoping the talent drop-off from Giannis shows itself in the quarterfinal.\n\nAfter Antetokounmpo, Vasilis Toliopoulos is the next-highest scorer for Greece, in 29th at 12 points per game. Thomas Walkup is the only other Greek player inside the Top 45 in scoring.\n\nGiannis should be seeing a ton of bodies Tuesday. He'll have no choice but to trust the right play leads to something good.\n\nGermany vs Greece same-game parlay (SGP)\n\nSchroder leads the tournament in assists and has helped the Germans tie the Americans for the best assist-to-turnover ratio at 1.9. After limiting the more iso-heavy attack of Canada to 18 assists in its opener, Greece has allowed 23.5 assists per game over the last two against Australia and Spain.\n\nSchroder's strength is probing the defense while attacking on the pick and roll and making the right play. Since opening with six assists in a blowout win over Japan, Schroder has topped this assist line with ease over the last two.\n\nLet's wrap this SGP with Antetokounmpo's rebounding line, set at 8.5.

Mandatory Credit: John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports / John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports\n\nGermany has answered the call after winning gold in the FIBA World Cup in 2023, blitzing the difficult Group B that included the highly touted France team, and into the knockout stage where the team will face Greece.\n\nLed by Giannis Antetokounmpo, Greece will try to stun the favored German team that looks like a serious contender to medal in the 2024 Olympic Games. Littered with NBA players like Franz and Mo Wagner as well as point guard Dennis Schroder, Germany will look to limit the former MVP's impact and cruise to the semifinals.\n\nHere's our full breakdown for the Greece vs. Germany knockout stage matchup.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo: Leading the Olympic Games in points per game with 27, Antetokounmpo has been a dominant force in Paris, adding nearly eight rebounds and four assists. Against a formidable front line, Anteotkounmpo will need to be at his best for Grece to advance.\n\nGermany\n\nFranz Wagner: Wagner has been impressive for the German squad, the Orlando Magic forward. He is averaging nearly 22 points as he showcased why he is a budding star in the NBA on the Olympic stage. Can he take advantage of a relatively shallow Greece squad? We saw Santi Aldama drop 19 points and grab 12 rebounds.\n\nGermany was the class of Group B in the group stages, winning by double digits in all three games and an average margin of 12.3 points.\n\nGreece surprised the Australian squad in the Group stage and was able to stay competitive with the Canadian and Spanish squad, losing by seven in each game.\n\nInstead of looking at the spread for this one, I'm going to eye the total, which seems to be underrating the German defense. The Germans haven't allowed more than 77 points this entire Olympic Games while Greece has been more of a defense-minded team as well, breaking 80 points just once.\n\nWith Antetokounmpo patrolling the rim, I'm most confident in the game being a cagey affair with defense leading the way.\n\nPICK: UNDER 162.5 (-144)\n\nGame odds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri":

Germany came back strong in the second period and closed the gap. The two teams finished in a tie 36-36 the first half.\n\nIn the second half, Germany dominated with the final score: 76-63\n\nThe German team includes NBA regulars like Daniel Theis, Dennis Schroder, and Orlando Magic brothers Moritz and Franz Wagner. It proved to be quite formidable against Greece, as it did during group play finishing 3-0 and +47 in point differential.\n\nThe world champions Germany have three top-eight showings - 1984, 1992 and 2021. Dennis Schroder and co. have come to France with the clear goal of getting past this game and get within one victory of a first-ever medal. Germany are sky-high on confidence right now, especially after blasting hosts France to finish the group stage undefeated.\n\nUntil today Greece held a 12-8 all-time advantage over Germany overall including an 87-64 win in the group stage at the 2008 Olympics.\n\nStarting with their victory over Germany in the Final of the FIBA EuroBasket 2005, Greece had won five straight games before Germany defeated the Greeks 107-96 in the Quarter-Finals of the FIBA EuroBasket 2022.\n\nGreece's road to the Olympics quarters\n\nGreece finished third in the group face. To progress to the next round they needed Serbia to beat South Sudan on Saturday. The Serbs did their job winning 96-85.\n\nGreece made the elimination round along with Germany, Serbia, Australia, France, Canada, Brazil and the United States.\n\nGreece made this a possibility by beating Australia 77-71 in their final group play game, bringing their differential to -8.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo led his country to the first and crucial win in the Paris 2024 Olympics. The Milwaukee Bucks star had 20 points, 7 rebounds, and 6 assists in almost 33 minutes on the court.\n\nBacked by Antetokounmpo, Greece made it to the Paris Games by winning a qualifying tournament earlier this month.\n\nIt put Greece back in the Olympic basketball tournament for the first time since it made the 12-team field in Beijing in 2008, and just the fifth time overall. Playing in the Olympics is one of the few things the two-time NBA MVP hadn't achieved.\n\nAfter the Australia clash Giannis Antetokounmpo said: \"We wanted to be on this stage for a long time, but we weren't fortunate enough. I'm trying to enjoy every single day, with my teammates. Like, I remember that game the first day, I texted my wife and I told her 'I cannot stop smiling.'

After winning all three group phase games and claiming the top spot in Group B, the reigning world champions are set to square off with Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo's Greece squad.\n\nThe game is the first of four Olympic quarterfinal contests on Tuesday. The game will tip off at 5:00 a.m. ET, or 11:00 a.m. local time, from Bercy Arena in Paris, France.\n\nThere is history at stake - the winner of Tuesday's clash will advance to their nation's first-ever semifinal round in an Olympic basketball tournament.\n\nThe Germans have never medaled in the Olympics, yet seem destined to change that this year. Greece has three fifth-place finishes in their last three appearances at the Games, and are participating in their first Olympics since 2008.\n\nTV: E!, also streaming live on Peacock (subscription required)\n\nRecent Results: Germany defeated Japan (97-77), Brazil (86-73) and France (85-71) throughout the group phase. Greece lost to Canada (86-79) and Spain (84-77), but defeated Australia (77-71) in the group phase. Advancement for Greece to the quarterfinal round came by way of tiebreaker.\n\nLast Meeting: Germany defeated Greece, 107-96, in the quarterfinals of the FIBA EuroBasket 2022. Overall, the Greeks have emerged victorious in 12 of the 20 total matchups between the two nations.\n\nFranz and Mo Wagner: Franz put the world on notice with a stellar showing in Germany's final group phase game, pouring in 26 points from a variety of spots on the floor as the Germans routed host nation France. Following the performance, Franz is scoring 21.7 points/game over the three contests thus far, and is alone in second for most points scored these Games with 65.\n\nMo is doing his part as well - adding 10.3 points and 4.0 rebounds a game in just 16.2 minutes a game, providing a pivotal role in rotation with Daniel Theis in the German frontcourt.\n\nDennis Schroder: Few longtime NBA players elevate their game on the international level better than Schroder, who's continuing the trend in 2024. His 19.7 points a game comes on 54.8% shooting from the field, and he's been the best facilitator in Paris thus far. Sporting a 2.7 assist-to-turnover ratio and 27 total dimes after the first three games, he's vital to generating open looks for himself and others - a big reason why the Germans are having so much success so far in these Olympics.\n\nGreece\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo: The so-called \"Greek Freak\" has yet to disappoint in captaining Greece on the hardwood during these Games. He's the Olympic basketball tournament's leading scorer by a wide margin, averaging 27.0 points on a whopping 68.9% shooting percentage from the field. A two-time NBA MVP and former NBA champion, he's now trying to lead his Greek team to a gold medal, which would perhaps be the greatest accomplishment of his career to date.\n\nAntetokounmpo is only joined by one other double-digit scorer, Vasilis Toliopolous (12.0 points/game), so it's fair to say a lot of the weight of Greece's success lies on the shoulders of Giannis.\n\nNick Calathes: The leading assister on the floor for Greece has been Calathes, whose 7.3 assists a game is tied with USA's LeBron James for second amongst athletes still competing in the tournament.\n\nAside from finding a way to limit Antetokounmpo, shutting off the ball movement from Greece could be among Germany's keys to a victory.\n\nRelated Stories on the Orlando Magic\n\nSummer of Franz continues: Draymond Green becomes the latest to join the Franz Wagner fan club, saying he's \"taken the next step\" as Germany threatens for Olympic gold.

Option A: Feed one of the best players in the world, even more so on a stage where fewer people can guard him, and let him dominate. Option B: Let Antetokounmpo act on that overwhelming attention, with the ball movement and shotmaking that's kept Greece competitive.\n\nBut Germany is deeper. And it has momentum, already soundly beaten a medal contender with a capable tandem in Wagner and Schroder. Wagner already proved that no inside presence elicits enough fear for him to shy from the rim.

minutes remaining in the first quarter.\n\nNick Calathes found Antetokounmpo for an alley-oop dunk less than a minute later, following up with a three-pointer that gave Greece a 12-point lead with less than a minute left in the first.\n\nBut Germany slowly turned the tide, Franz Wagner and Moritz Wagner scoring six first-half points apiece, and tied the scores up at half-time.\n\nDennis Schroder opened the third with a three-pointer that gave Germany their first lead of the game.\n\nAnd after a back-and-forth battle, Isaac Bonga's three-pointer at the buzzer to end the third sent the Germans into the final period with a 59-52 lead.\n\nJohannes Thiemann finished with 10 points, six rebounds and a steal and Schroder had 13 points and assists coming off the bench.\n\n\"We struggled with their physicality, but I thought our second group came in and did an outstanding job in that end of the first quarter and really kind of gave us the energy and physicality to get back in the

Gambling is not offered on this website in any form.\n\nGermany will battle Greence in the men's basketball quarterfinals. One country will stay, and one will go as we share our Olympics odds series and make a Germany-Greece prediction and pick.\n\nGermany dominated their group, going 3-0 to advance to the quarterfinals. First, they destroyed Japan 97-77. The Germans then routed Brazil 86-73 before overpowering France 85-71. Amazingly, they overcame Victor Wembanyama and the French squad in the final game thanks in part to Dennis Schroeder and Franz Wagner, who each had 26 points. Wagner enjoyed dunking all over the French and now will face off against a certain 'Greek Freak' who will surely be waiting for him.\n\nThe Germans have long had gold medal aspirations. While the United States lurks in the shadows, Germany still must overcome the knockout round and take out Greece first. If they get past the Greeks, they will face the winner of Canada and France.\n\nGreece struggled in the group stage, going 1-2. Initially, they lost 86-79 to Canada before losing 84-77 to Spain. But the Greeks managed to snag a win, overcoming Australia 77-71 in the finale to salvage a game. Not many people believe that Greece has a chance to go far in the knockout round. In fact, they come into this battle as 7.5-point underdogs.\n\nBut Giannis Antetokounmpo will power the Greeks through and give them the best chance to try and keep up with Germany. Furthermore, he will look to replicate what he did against Australia.\n\nGermany and Greece have faced off twice in Olympic history, with the Greeks winning both. First, the Greeks defeated Germany 73-60 in the 2004 Olympics before again routing them 87-64 in 2008.\n\nGermany has benefited from some solid scoring and rebounding. Ultimately, the NBA talents on this team have done a good job of carrying the Germans.\n\nWagner has been solid in the Olympics, averaging 21.7 points and five assists per game. Now, he looks to remain strong up front and continue converting his shooting chances. Schroeder is showing how good he can be both with his shot and his ability to distribute the basketball. So far, he is averaging 19.7 points and nine assists per game. Isaac Bonga has been a great third scorer, averaging 11 points per game.\n\nThe Germans are strong on the boards. Significantly, Daniel Theis is averaging seven rebounds per game, while Johannes Voightmann is averaging six boards.\n\nGermany will cover the spread if Wagner and Schroeder continue shooting the rock well and hitting their stride. Additionally, they need to prevent Antetokounmpo from dominating the boards.\n\nWhy Greece Will Cover the Spread/Win\n\nGreece will need to play at its absolute best if it hopes to overcome Germany. To do this, they need their best player to rock and for others to do their part.\n\nAntetokounmpo is one of the best players in the NBA and has also been one of the best in the Olympic games. He is averaging 27 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 3.7 assists per game. Antetokounmpo will be a force on the boards and will be the most dangerous player on the court. If he can get himself to another level, it may give the Germans some issues.\n\nVasilis Toliopoulos is the second option for the Greeks. So far, he is averaging 12 points per game and will be looked at to help the 'Greek Freak' out. Thomas Walkup is the next option, and he currently is averaging 9.3 points and 3.7 assists per game.\n\nBut the Greeks will only get past Germany if they can defend the rim efficiently. While Antetokounmpo is one of the best in the world, others need to step up. Plus, they should win the board battle and control the flow of the game.\n\nGreece will cover the spread if Antetokounmpo can have the game of his life and dominate the front of the rim while also getting his teammates involved. Then, they need to stop Schroeder and Wagner from hitting their shots.\n\nFinal Germany-Greece Prediction & Pick\n\nThings have been relatively easy for the Germans so far. However, they have not run into an interior prescience like Antetokounmpo. Because of that, it might be slightly more difficult for the Germans to dominate them. Greece has trouble with shooting the rock. However, their defense has been stellar for the most part. We expect this to go down to the wire. While Germany will likely win, we expect them to struggle and for Greece to cover the spread.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Gordon Herbert's team won 76-63, avoiding Greek revenge two years after EuroBasket 2022.\n\nFranz Wagner with 18 points was the top scorer of the winning side, while Dennis Schroder with 11 points, 8 assists, and just one turnover made things happen for the winners.\n\nIsaac Bonga was also huge on both ends of the floor for the German national team.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo with 22 points was the leading scorer of Greece once again, followed by Thomas Walkup with 12. Captain Kostas Papanikolaou had 10 points and 8 rebounds.\n\nA first-half defensive battle\n\nGreece started the game with a 10-2 run forcing Germany to take a time-out with less than four minutes played.\n\nWith the German offense out of synch, the lead jumped to 12 points (16-4) after a thunderous dunk by Giannis, and the first quarter ended with Greece up by 10 (21-11).\n\nGermany started the second quarter with a quick 5-0 spurt (21-16) and pushed to make it a one-point game (33-32) and tied it all at 36, which was the halftime time score.\n\nGermany getting things done\n\nDennis Schroder with a contested three gave Germany the lead (39-36) for the first time with the first basket of the second half. Still, Greece with two threes, by Walkup and Papanikolaou got the lead back (44-41).\n\nA big three by Franz Wagner put Germany up (50-47), only for Greece to reply with Giannis and tie the score at 50. However, at the end of the period, the score was 59-52 after a crucial buzzer-beating three by Bonga with Germany having their biggest lead of the game yet.\n\nThe run continued with Franz Wagner scoring for an 11-2 partial score (61-52) and Greece was on the ropes. To be exact with Giannis reacting, the lead was trimmed to give (61-56) but that was the best they could do until the end.\n\nFranz Wagner didn't stop and scored in traffic for the 10-point lead at 67-57, only to be followed by a huge three-pointer by Dennis Schroder. He called game by creating again the 15-point gap at 72-59.

Germany, meanwhile, rolled to 3-0 while walloping France and looking the part of gold-medal contenders.\n\nBut it was the underdogs who threw the first punch in Paris: Greece short-circuited the beautiful German machine by throwing multiple bodies at Schroder, and Giannis got cooking in transition on the other end, scoring 10 points over the game's first six minutes as his team jumped out to an 18-6 lead.\n\nSlowly but surely, however, Germany settled in, largely thanks to a game effort from its unheralded second unit. With so much attention on Schroder, head coach Gordon Herbert finally just took the ball out of his hands entirely, with guys like Mo Wagner and Nick Weiler-Babb catching a rhythm on offense and helping Germany climb back into the game. The lead was down to five early in the second quarter, and by the time the half ended, the Germans had knotted things up at 36.\n\nFrom there, it felt like just a matter of time before the dam broke. Giannis put up a typically Herculean effort, leading all scorers with 22 points on 9-of-14 shooting. He got some help from Thomas Walkup and Konstantinos Papanikoloau, who knocked down a combined 4-of-10 from three. In the end, though, Greece simply didn't have the horses around its MVP: Non-Giannis players shot just 5-of-15 in the second half, as Germany successfully walled off the paint and forced Greece to come up with another answer.\n\nThe Germans also finally got their stars cooking on the other end. Schroder and Wagner scored 20 of Germany's 40 points in the second half, pacing the team to a seven-point lead at the end of three quarters that more or less put the game to bed. Wagner lead Germany with 18 points on 8-of-17 shooting, and while it wasn't the vintage Schroder we saw in group play -- he shot just 5-of-12 for the game, incluidng 2-of-7 in the first half -- he did deliver the dagger with a logo 3 late in the fourth.\n\nIt wasn't the same sort of rollicking performance we saw from Germany in group play, but well, we're not in group play anymore. This is the knockout stage, and everything ratchets up; it was encouraging to watch Germany respond when its plan A wasn't working, and its two stars stayed cool and delivered when it mattered down the stretch. Now the competition will get even tougher, with a matchup against either France or Canada in the semifinal.", "source": {"uri": "nbcolympics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "nbcolympics.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Schr\u00f6der", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dennis Schr\u00f6der"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Wagner_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Franz Wagner (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Weiler-Babb", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Weiler-Babb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Walkup", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Walkup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Herbert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Herbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Wagner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritz_Wagner_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moritz Wagner (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://images.nbcolympics.com/sites/default/files/2023-03/ParisDefaultThumbnail.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792328", "eventUri": "eng-9792328", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Germany's previous best finish at the Olympics was seventh place in 1992.\n\nGermany is unbeaten at the Paris Games after going 3-0 in the group stage.\n\nWagner said he and his teammates haven't had to look too deep for extra motivation during their time in France.\n\n\"I think everybody on the team knows that we've got a special group, and I want to get the most out of this,\" Wagner said. \"Obviously, last year was special but we're trying to continue that and hopefully keep that momentum going forward.\"\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo had 22 points for Greece, which was denied its first semifinals berth in Antetokounmpo's first Olympics appearance.\n\nFollow | Paris 2024 Olympics Live Updates, Day 11\n\nGreece had 15 turnovers, leading to 20 points for Germany.\n\n\"There were a lot of details in this (game) they get you punished.

But Germany settled in and used a big third quarter to take a seven-point lead into the fourth. Germany started the final period on a 13-5 run to increase its lead to 72-57 with 1:50 remaining.\n\nGermany coach Gordon Hebert said going to a bigger lineup and switching more on defense was effective after halftime.\n\nWagner said carrying the same mentality throughout the tournament benefitted Germany after its initial slow start.\n\n\"I think it speaks to our maturity,\" Wagner said. \"We even talked about it at halftime -- not everything's going to go perfect all the time.

As a testament of how well Germany has been playing, they have made it to the quarterfinals to face a tough opponent.\n\nThe International Basketball Federation (FIBA) announced on Saturday that Germany will be facing Greece in the quarterfinals of the Olympics that starts on Tuesday. Germany is coming into Tuesday's matchup with a 3-0 record after beating Japan, Brazil, and France during the group stage to get to where they are now.\n\nSchroder has been doing his part for Germany as he is averaging 19.7 points, 3.0 rebounds, and 9.0 assists per game while shooting 54.8% from the field and 40.9% from three-point land. Schroder has also been getting some help as Orlando Magic forward Franz Wagner is averaging 21.7 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 2.0 assists per contest while shooting 51.1% from the floor and 21.2% from deep.\n\nGermany will be heading to the quarterfinals for the second consecutive year after making it to the 2023 FIBA World Cup last summer and winning the gold medal.

Mo turned in an impressive performance himself, scoring eight points, grabbing five rebounds and taking on the Giannis Antetokounmpo assignment defensively.\n\nFor a full box score of the game, click here.\n\nThe win nets history for the Germans. Winners of the 2023 FIBA World Cup, Germany advanced to the country's first-ever semifinal in men's Olympic basketball. They await the winner of Tuesday afternoon's France-Canada matchup, where a trip to the gold medal game will be on the line Thursday.\n\nAny medal earned by Germany would be the country's first in this event.\n\nHere's how it all happened in the opening quarterfinal contest from Bercy Arena in Paris:\n\nComing into Tuesday morning's affair, the Germans proudly boasted the Olympics' third-best scoring offense - scoring 89.3 points a game over the three group phase games that helped them qualify for the knockout round.\n\nA different story unfolded through the game's first ten minutes, however - a segment the Greeks dominated in all facets. Germany succumbed to Greece's intense defensive pressure, struggling with turnovers and overall offensive flow on that end of the floor.\n\nAveraging just 10 turnovers as a team per game heading into the contest on top of the already noted scoring prowess, Greece couldn't have dreamt up a better start than forcing the Germans into four turnovers and a 5-18 (1-8 from three) display of shooting from the field.\n\nPredictably, the Greece offense went largely as Giannis Antetokounmo went - scoring six early points at the rim and helping to make the right decision as the Greek engine with the ball in his hands.\n\nAs a result, Greece led after a quarter and had an upset on its mind - the scoreboard reading 21-11.\n\nThe single-elimination nature of the knockout round emphasized the need for a quick break out of its early slump, and that's what Germany found in the second quarter. The Germans were a perfect 8-8 from inside the paint and 11-15 overall from the field in the second 10 minutes, scoring 26 points to bring the score to a deadlock at the halftime break.\n\nAlthough Germany still periodically struggled with turnovers, more possessions ended with a make than a miss. The German scoring contingent was spread evenly, with the Wagner brothers' six points apiece leading the way for the reigning World Cup champions. The difference, though, came in the efficiency department.\n\nOn the heels of his best game in the Olympic tournament last time out, Franz struggled in the first half of the follow-up act - shooting 3-8 from the field and 0-2 from three. That follows the trend of Franz's only true struggle throughout these Games to this point, coming into the quarterfinal clash at just 21% from three throughout the tournament.\n\nHis brother and teammate Mo, however, shot 3-3 from the field, owning six of the 18 bench points for Germany.\n\nAs a whole, Germany's presence on the offensive glass kept them in the game, countering the success the Greeks had with turning their opposition over.\n\nStill, after trailing for just 4:28 through the first three games of the Olympics, the Germans never led and essentially trailed the entire first half of the win-or-go-home game and offered the Greeks the mindset that victory was a plausible outcome.\n\nAlthough Germany didn't wait long after the prolonged break to capture its first lead of the contest, it still didn't deter Greece in its efforts to pull the shocker of the Olympic tournament. The pace of the game slowed, and baskets had the heightened feel that they had to be earned.\n\nThus, when Franz eventually drilled his first and only make from three in the contest (six attempts) - a stepback three a few feet behind the line with a hand in his face - a big show of emotion came with it. The bucket capped an 8-0 run to put Germany back on top midway through the third quarter, 50-47., and was indicative of a game that looked to have finally turned in their favor.\n\nDefensively, Germany essentially threw everything it had at Antetokounmpo, hoping to make anyone else beat them. As more white jerseys flooded toward No. 34 when the Greeks had the ball, Greece struggled to find contributions elsewhere offensively despite Germany's hesitancy to fully close out the contest.\n\nThe ratcheted-up defensive pressure from Germany forced 11 turnovers in the second half alone, and all Greek players besides Antetokounmpo shot a combined 5-15 from the field. Greece scored just 27 points in the game's second half, unable to overcome a floundering half-court offense that didn't have the longevity to hang with Germany's shotmaking.\n\nShaking off the poor start percentage-wise, Franz was the catalyst of the German's advancement through to the semifinals of the Olympics - the first time in the country's history at the Games.\n\nFranz beats France: Magic duo, led by Franz Wagner's 26 points, help propel Germany past France and into knockout round with Group B's top spot.

They ate into Greece's lead, outscoring them 25-15 in the second quarter and managing to tie the score 36-36 at halftime. From there, Germany was able to steadily build a lead that rivaled the one Greece had on them early in the game while Greece struggled to get the ball through the basket.\n\nThe standout stars for Germany were Franz Wagner (18 points, three rebounds, two assists) and Dennis Schroder (13 points, eight rebounds).

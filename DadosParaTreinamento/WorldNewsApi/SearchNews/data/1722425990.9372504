'But I was starving and was about to cook something to eat. She came back 10 minutes later and said I could stay, but that I'd be in danger. 'I'm not scared. I'm in my own home. I'm sick and I'm not allowed to go out anyway, my tablets are at home.' Abigail Cronin, 21, a student at Nottingham University who lives on Rolleston Drive said her 'car and all her stuff was stuck inside the cordon'. She added that there was a lot of 'mixed information' that was 'frustrating'.

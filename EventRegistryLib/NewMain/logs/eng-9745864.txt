Weinstein has a pretrial status hearing in Manhattan criminal court, Friday, July 19, 2024. (Curtis Means /Pool Photo via AP, File)NEW YORK (AP) - Harvey Weinstein is scheduled to appear in a New York court Friday ahead of a planned retrial on rape and sexual assault charges. The former Hollywood movie mogul's pretrial hearing in Manhattan criminal court will address issues related to evidence in the case, including text messages. At a hearing last week, prosecutors said they anticipate a November retrial. They told Judge Curtis Farber they are still actively pursuing new claims against Weinstein, though the prosecutors conceded they hadn't yet brought any findings to a grand jury. Weinstein's lawyer, Arthur Aidala, argued the investigation was simply a delay tactic. New York's highest court threw out Weinstein's 2020 conviction earlier this year, ruling that the original trial judge unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations that weren't part of the case. The conviction had been considered a landmark in the #MeToo movement, an era that began in 2017 amid numerous allegations of sexual misconduct against the once powerful studio boss behind \"Pulp Fiction\"\u009d and \"Shakespeare in Love.\" Weinstein had been convicted of rape in the third degree for an attack on an aspiring actress and of forcing himself on a TV and film production assistant in 2006. He has denied any wrongdoing. Prosecutors have said one of the accusers in that case, Jessica Mann, is prepared to testify against Weinstein again. Gloria Allred, a lawyer for the second accuser, Mimi Haley, said last week that her client hadn't yet decided whether to participate in the retrial. The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann did. Weinstein, 72, is jailed on Rikers Island. Aidala has said he suffers from diabetes, macular degeneration and fluid in his lungs and heart and has complained that Weinstein isn't receiving adequate medical care in jail.

Weinstein has a pretrial status hearing in Manhattan criminal court, Friday, July 19, 2024. (Curtis Means /Pool Photo via AP, File)NEW YORK (AP) - A judge on Friday tentatively scheduled Harvey Weinstein's planned retrial on rape and sexual assault charges to begin on Nov. 12. Weinstein wore an American flag pin on his jacket during a brief appearance at a courthouse in Manhattan, which was delayed by about a half hour. The former Hollywood movie mogul's pretrial hearing in Manhattan criminal court was scheduled to address issues related to evidence in the case, including text messages. At a hearing last week, prosecutors said they anticipated a November retrial. They told Judge Curtis Farber that they were still actively pursuing new claims against Weinstein, though they conceded that they hadn't yet brought any findings to a grand jury. Weinstein denies sexually assaulting anyone. New York's highest court threw out Weinstein's 2020 conviction earlier this year, ruling that the original trial judge unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations that weren't part of the case. The conviction had been considered a landmark in the #MeToo movement, an era that began in 2017 amid numerous allegations of sexual misconduct against the once powerful studio boss behind \"Pulp Fiction\"\u009d and \"Shakespeare in Love.\" Weinstein had been convicted of rape in the third degree for an attack on an aspiring actress and of forcing himself on a TV and film production assistant in 2006. He has denied any wrongdoing. Prosecutors have said one of the accusers in that case, Jessica Mann, is prepared to testify against Weinstein again. Gloria Allred, a lawyer for the second accuser, Mimi Haley, said last week that her client hadn't yet decided whether to participate in the retrial. The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann did. Weinstein, 72, is jailed on Rikers Island. His attorney, Arthur Aidala, has complained that Weinstein hasn't been getting proper care in jail for diabetes, macular degeneration and fluid in his lungs and heart. Weinstein also was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape and is still sentenced to 16 years in prison in California. In an appeal filed there last month, his lawyers argued he didn't get a fair trial in that case.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"},

They told Farber that they were still actively pursuing new claims against Weinstein, though they conceded that they hadn't yet brought any findings to a grand jury.\n\nWeinstein denies that he sexually assaulted anyone.\n\nHis lawyers told Farber that they'd prefer an earlier trial date.\n\n\"He is anxious to go to trial and prove his innocence,\" one of Weinstein's attorneys, Diana Fabi Samson, said outside the courthouse.\n\nWeinstein, 72, is jailed on Rikers Island. One of his attorneys, Arthur Aidala, has complained that Weinstein hasn't been getting proper care in jail for diabetes, macular degeneration and fluid in his lungs and heart.\n\nAidala was not in court on Friday, but another Weinstein attorney, John Esposito, told reporters that during a sidebar conversation with the judge, the defense again brought up Weinstein's medical issues. Farber said he would assist to the extent that he could to ensure that Weinstein is properly cared for, Esposito said.\n\nEsposito said the preference would be for Weinstein to be moved back to Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital, where he could receive proper medical attention so he's in a good physical and mental state of mind for trial.\n\nHe was treated at Bellevue for several days after he was brought to New York City hours after the state's highest court threw out his 2020 conviction earlier this year. The appeals court wrote that the original trial judge unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations that weren't part of the case.\n\nHe remains jailed in part because he was sentenced to 16 years in prison in California after he was convicted in a rape case in Los Angeles in 2022. In an appeal filed there last month, his lawyers argued he didn't get a fair trial. Esposito said Friday that he doesn't expect the appeal in the California case to be decided for at least another year.\n\nWeinstein's New York conviction had been considered a landmark in the #MeToo movement, an era that began in 2017 amid numerous allegations of sexual misconduct against the once powerful studio boss behind \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Shakespeare in Love.\"\n\nIn New York, Weinstein had been convicted of rape in the third degree for an attack on an aspiring actress and of forcing himself on a TV and film production assistant in 2006. He has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nProsecutors have said one of the accusers in that case, Jessica Mann, is prepared to testify against Weinstein again. Gloria Allred, a lawyer for the second accuser, Mimi Haley, said last week that her client hadn't yet decided whether to participate in the retrial.\n\nThe Associated Press does not generally identify

They told Farber that they were still actively pursuing new claims against Weinstein, though they conceded that they hadn't yet brought any findings to a grand jury.\n\nWeinstein denies that he sexually assaulted anyone.\n\nHis lawyers told Farber that they'd prefer an earlier trial date.\n\n\"He is anxious to go to trial and prove his innocence,\" one of Weinstein's attorneys, Diana Fabi Samson, said outside the courthouse.\n\nWeinstein, 72, is jailed on Rikers Island. One of his attorneys, Arthur Aidala, has complained that Weinstein hasn't been getting proper care in jail for diabetes, macular degeneration and fluid in his lungs and heart.\n\nAidala was not in court on Friday, but another Weinstein attorney, John Esposito, told reporters that during a sidebar conversation with the judge, the defense again brought up Weinstein's medical issues. Farber said he would assist to the extent that he could to ensure that Weinstein is properly cared for, Esposito said.\n\nEsposito said the preference would be for Weinstein to be moved back to Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital, where he could receive proper medical attention so he's in a good physical and mental state of mind for trial.\n\nHe was treated at Bellevue for several days after he was brought to New York City hours after the state's highest court threw out his 2020 conviction earlier this year. The appeals court wrote that the original trial judge unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations that weren't part of the case.\n\nHe remains jailed in part because he was sentenced to 16 years in prison in California after he was convicted in a rape case in Los Angeles in 2022. In an appeal filed there last month, his lawyers argued he didn't get a fair trial. Esposito said Friday that he doesn't expect the appeal in the California case to be decided for at least another year.\n\nWeinstein's New York conviction had been considered a landmark in the #MeToo movement, an era that began in 2017 amid numerous allegations of sexual misconduct against the once powerful studio boss behind \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Shakespeare in Love.\"\n\nIn New York, Weinstein had been convicted of rape in the third degree for an attack on an aspiring actress and of forcing himself on a TV and film production assistant in 2006. He has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nProsecutors have said one of the accusers in that case, Jessica Mann, is prepared to testify against Weinstein again. Gloria Allred, a lawyer for the second accuser, Mimi Haley, said last week that her client hadn't yet decided whether to participate in the retrial.\n\nThe Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann did.\n\nMore from this section\n\nModern Foot & Ankle Expands Reconstructive Surgery Services in Celebration, Winter

That conviction was not affected by the New York court's decision, and he has not begun serving the California sentence.\n\nMiramax's hit movies included \"Shakespeare in Love\" and \"Pulp Fiction.\" Weinstein's film studio filed for bankruptcy in March 2018.\n\n(Reporting by Jack Queen; Editing by Noeleen Walder and Nick Zieminski)", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_queen@aol.com", "name": "Jack Queen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Weinstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miramax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeToo_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MeToo movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_a_fair_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right to a fair trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hearing (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_misconduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual misconduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_magazine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pulp magazine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Shakespeare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rikers_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rikers Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rikers Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Rape", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Rape", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_reuters_29/0f60d9d577697bbaf65021bb64adcad9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745864", "eventUri": "eng-9745864", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-07-", "textStart": 84, "textEnd": 91}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-02-", "textStart": 1086, "textEnd": 1099}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-03-", "textStart": 2893, "textEnd": 2903}], "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

They told Farber that they were still actively pursuing new claims against Weinstein, though they conceded that they hadn't yet brought any findings to a grand jury.\n\nWeinstein denies that he sexually assaulted anyone.\n\nHis lawyers told Farber that they'd prefer an earlier trial date.\n\n\"He is anxious to go to trial and prove his innocence,\" one of Weinstein's attorneys, Diana Fabi Samson, said outside the courthouse.\n\nWeinstein, 72, is jailed on Rikers Island. One of his attorneys, Arthur Aidala, has complained that Weinstein hasn't been getting proper care in jail for diabetes, macular degeneration and fluid in his lungs and heart.\n\nAidala was not in court on Friday, but another Weinstein attorney, John Esposito, told reporters that during a sidebar conversation with the judge, the defense again brought up Weinstein's medical issues. Farber said he would assist to the extent that he could to ensure that Weinstein is properly cared for, Esposito said.\n\nEsposito said the preference would be for Weinstein to be moved back to Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital, where he could receive proper medical attention so he's in a good physical and mental state of mind for trial.\n\nHe was treated at Bellevue for several days after he was brought to New York City hours after the state's highest court threw out his 2020 conviction earlier this year. The appeals court wrote that the original trial judge unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations that weren't part of the case.\n\nHe remains jailed in part because he was sentenced to 16 years in prison in California after he was convicted in a rape case in Los Angeles in 2022. In an appeal filed there last month, his lawyers argued he didn't get a fair trial. Esposito said Friday that he doesn't expect the appeal in the California case to be decided for at least another year.\n\nWeinstein's New York conviction had been considered a landmark in the #MeToo movement, an era that began in 2017 amid numerous allegations of sexual misconduct against the once powerful studio boss behind \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Shakespeare in Love.\"\n\nIn New York, Weinstein had been convicted of rape in the third degree for an attack on an aspiring actress and of forcing himself on a TV and film production assistant in 2006. He has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nProsecutors have said one of the accusers in that case, Jessica Mann, is prepared to testify against Weinstein again. Gloria Allred, a lawyer for the second accuser, Mimi Haley, said last week that her client hadn't yet decided whether to participate in the retrial.\n\nThe Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann did.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The Manhattan criminal court hearing will address evidence issues, including crucial text messages.\n\nWeinstein's 2020 conviction was overturned by New York's highest court earlier this year, which ruled that the trial judge allowed unfair testimony unrelated to the charges. This conviction had been a significant moment in the #MeToo movement, which emerged in 2017 with multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against Weinstein.\n\nProsecutors expect the retrial to commence in November. They are actively investigating new claims, though they have not yet presented these to a grand jury. Weinstein's lawyer, Arthur Aidala, claims this is a delay tactic. Jessica Mann, one of the original accusers, is prepared to testify again, while Mimi Haley, another accuser, has not yet decided.\n\nWeinstein, 72, currently incarcerated on Rikers Island, faces significant health issues including diabetes, macular degeneration, and heart and lung conditions. Aidala has raised concerns about the adequacy of Weinstein's medical care in jail. Additionally, Weinstein is serving a 16-year sentence in California for another rape conviction in 2022, which his lawyers are appealing.\n\nThe retrial is set against the backdrop of the broader #MeToo movement, reflecting ongoing societal and legal battles against sexual misconduct. As the retrial approaches, the legal and public scrutiny on Weinstein's case continues to highlight issues of justice and accountability within the entertainment industry and beyond.\n\nFor more updates and in-depth coverage, stay tuned to Newsd.in.", "source": {"uri": "newsd.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsd.in"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Weinstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preliminary_hearing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Preliminary hearing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeToo_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MeToo movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_misconduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual misconduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macular degeneration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rikers_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rikers Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rikers Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://newsd.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/harvey_weinstein-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745864", "eventUri": "eng-9745864", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

November date for Weinstein retrial", "body": "A judge has set a tentative date of November 12, 2024 for a retrial of former movie producer Harvey Weinstein on sexual assault charges\n\nA New York judge on Friday set a tentative November date for the retrial of disgraced movie producer Harvey Weinstein on sexual assault charges.\n\nWeinstein, 72, was convicted in New York in 2020 of the rape and sexual assault of actress Jessica Mann and of forcibly performing oral sex on a production assistant.\n\nA New York appeals court overturned his conviction in April in a shock reversal in one of the defining cases of the #MeToo movement.\n\nThe court ruled that the trial judge had erred by allowing testimony from accusers who Weinstein was not formally charged with assaulting.\n\nJudge Curtis Farber, at a brief hearing in a Manhattan courtroom on Friday, set a tentative start date of November 12 for Weinstein's retrial.\n\nThe judge said more details for the trial would be discussed at a hearing on September 12.\n\nWeinstein, who has health problems, appeared in court in a dark blue suit with a sort of disinterested look on his face.\n\nProsecutors have said Mann is prepared to testify against Weinstein again and they may bring additional sexual assault charges against the once-powerful film producer.\n\nAlthough Weinstein's New York conviction was overturned, he has remained behind bars because of a conviction for rape in California for which he received a sentence of 16 years.\n\nHis lawyers filed an appeal last month, arguing for a retrial in that case as well.\n\nBombshell allegations broke against the Oscar-winning Weinstein in 2017, launching the #MeToo movement, a watershed moment for women fighting sexual misconduct.\n\nWeinstein and his brother Bob co-founded Miramax Films.\n\nTheir hits included 1998's \"Shakespeare in Love,\" for which Weinstein shared a best picture Oscar.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Physically, he is not well, and that has affected his mental state.\"\n\nDuring a July 9 hearing, prosecutors told the judge an investigation into Weinstein is still ongoing after multiple accusers came forward following the overturned rape conviction. Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg explained that while they were conducting an investigation, a grand jury had not been convened. Weinstein's team claimed the new investigation was just a delay tactic used by the prosecution.\n\nHowever, the Manhattan District Attorneys Office denied the accusation, saying, \"There's certainly no delay tactics on our part. We're proceeding in the most expeditious manner.\"\n\nA New York appeals court overturned Weinstein's 2020 rape conviction on April 25, ordering a new trial in a stunning reversal of a landmark #MeToo case.\n\nIn a 4-3 decision, the court found that Weinstein's trial judge had allowed prosecutors to call as witnesses women who had said that Weinstein had assaulted them, even though their accusations did not specifically relate to the entertainment mogul's charges.\n\nWeinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison after being convicted in February 2020 of forcing oral sex on TV and film production assistant Mimi Haley in 2006 and third-degree rape of hairstylist Jessica Mann in 2013.\n\nHe was acquitted of first-degree rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault from actress Annabella Sciorra's allegations of rape in the 1990s. Weinstein has denied ever engaging in non-consensual sex.\n\nUltimately, the appeals court found that the trial judge should have only allowed witnesses to testify about the sexual assault encounters that Weinstein's charges stemmed from. During his trial, multiple women testified about sexual assaults allegedly performed by Weinstein, even though it wasn't what he faced charges for.\n\nAfter Weinstein's sentencing in New York in 2020, he was extradited to California in July 2021 to face sexual assault allegations made by four women in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills between 2004 and 2013.\n\nDue to the overturned conviction, California has requested Weinstein be extradited to begin serving out his 16-year sentence. Weinstein's team fought the extradition during a May 9 hearing.\n\n\"Our main concern in all of this is that Mr. Weinstein is here in New York, so we can prepare for trial and that he get the medical care he needs,\" Samson told reporters during a post-hearing press conference. \"And just concerned that travel ... would impact his health issues.\"\n\nShe later emphasized: \"He has very serious health issues. And I think it's also worth noting that since the day he was incarcerated, he has been in a hospital setting.\"\n\nSamson also noted that California is \"not in a position to extradite Mr. Weinstein because they have not done what they need to do.\"\n\nWeinstein's next hearing regarding the matter is August 7.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com",

sexual assault charges.\n\nWeinstein, 72, was convicted in New York in 2020 of the rape and sexual assault of actress Jessica Mann and of forcibly performing oral sex on a production assistant.\n\nA New York appeals court overturned his conviction in April in a shock reversal in one of the defining cases of the #MeToo movement.\n\nThe court ruled that the trial judge had erred by allowing testimony from accusers who Weinstein was not formally charged with assaulting.\n\nJudge Curtis Farber, at a brief hearing in a Manhattan courtroom on Friday, set a tentative start date of November 12 for Weinstein's retrial.\n\nThe judge said more details for the trial would be discussed at a hearing on September 12.\n\nWeinstein, who has health problems, appeared in court in a dark blue suit with

This follows his 2020 rape and sexual assault convictions being overturned by the Court of Appeals in New York in April.\n\nAs well as setting the retrial date, the hearing addressed issues concerning the evidence in the case against Weinstein, and concentrated on information from phones that will be reviewed by an ex-judge to decide whether materials are relevant to the ongoing case and should be passed over to the defence.\n\nAt the hearing last week, which announced that Weinstein is being investigated for \"additional violent sexual assaults\" separate from the previous investigation, prosecutors revealed they were anticipating a November retrial. They also informed Farber that they are actively pursuing new allegations against the former Miramax head but haven't yet brought findings before a grand jury. Weinstein denies that he's sexually assaulted anyone.\n\nWeinstein is presently jailed on Rikers Island, but one of his attorneys, Arthur Aidala, has complained that he hasn't been getting sufficient care there for diabetes, macular degeneration and fluid in his lungs and heart. One of his other attorneys, Diana Fabi Samson, told People outside the courthouse: \"He is anxious to go to trial and prove his innocence. Physically, he is not well, and that has affected his mental state\".\n\nThe defence says they prefer Weinstein to be moved to Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital, where he was treated after his 2020 rape conviction was dismissed in April.\n\nIn 2017, Weinstein was first formally accused of rape, sexual assault and abuse, with allegations dating back 30 years and materialising from over 80 different women in the movie industry. He was found guilty of the charges in 2020 and sentenced to 23 years in prison before it was overturned due to procedural errors.\n\nThe court reached the majority decision in April due to the judge allowing women to testify against Weinstein despite their allegations not relating to the case. A 4-3 verdict, the Court of Appeals elected to overturn the 2020 ruling, meaning it would go to a new trial.\n\nAlthough the case was overturned, Weinstein has remained incarcerated as a result of the separate trial in Los Angeles, in which he was found guilty of rape and sexual assault, and sentenced to 16 years behind bars in 2023. The further charges he faces in New York could lead to further imprisonment.\n\nThis is a developing story.", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arun_starkey@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Arun Starkey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Weinstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_offender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sex offender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miramax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Macular degeneration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rikers_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rikers Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rikers Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue_Hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bellevue Hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_law", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Procedural law"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/static/uploads/1/2023/07/Harvey-Weinstein-Producer-Far-Out-Magazine.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745864", "eventUri": "eng-9745864", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-12", "textStart": 127, "textEnd": 140, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 178, "textEnd": 187}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Prosecutors plan to charge him with additional violent sexual assaults as more women testify against him. Weinstein, who denies all non-consensual encounters, was sentenced to 23 years but saw his conviction overturned due to trial errors.\n\nHarvey Weinstein is due in Manhattan court on Friday as prosecutors prepare to retry the former movie mogul following the reversal of his 2020 rape conviction. Prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office revealed in court last week that they intend to charge Weinstein for \"additional violent sexual assaults\" after more women agreed to testify against the Miramax studio co-founder.\n\nThe new accusers have not been publicly identified, and prosecutors are seeking to shield certain evidence from public view while they prepare to seek a new grand jury indictment. Judge Curtis Farber is set to update the parties on Friday about his efforts to find a court-appointed hearing officer to referee disputes over what evidence Weinstein's legal team is entitled to see.\n\nWeinstein, 72, has denied wrongdoing and has denied having any non-consensual sexual encounters with anyone. Jurors in Manhattan found him guilty on rape charges in February 2020, but the New York Court of Appeals threw out the conviction in April, finding Weinstein did not get a fair trial because a judge improperly allowed testimony by accusers he was not formally charged with assaulting. Weinstein's conviction was a milestone for the #MeToo movement, in which women accused hundreds of men in entertainment, media, politics and other fields of sexual misconduct.\n\nA jury found the 72-year-old Miramax film studio co-founder sexually assaulted former production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006 and raped aspiring actress Jessica Mann in 2013. They are among more than 80 women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. Weinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison, but the New York Court of Appeals in April found the conviction could not stand because the judge overseeing the trial made a critical mistake by allowing three women to testify about alleged sexual assaults by Weinstein that were not part of the criminal charges against him.\n\nProsecutors have said that they will be ready to retry Weinstein by the fall, but no date has been set. If they obtain a new indictment, they could seek to combine it with the original case or try both of them separately.

Weinstein's lawyers said they wanted the trial to begin in September.\n\n\"I want both sides to start planning ahead,\" Farber said, adding he wanted no interruptions.\n\nWearing thick-framed black glasses, a navy suit, and an American flag pin, Weinstein, 72, was expressionless at the brief hearing scheduled to address a sealed motion regarding evidence, which was delayed due to worldwide tech outages, according to Farber. The jailed moviemaker high-fived his PR man Juda Engelmayer when he was brought into the courtroom in a wheelchair carrying a brown folder.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office in May said it would retry Weinstein after the Court of Appeals overturned the fallen movie mogul's 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction in April. The stunning opinion found the trial court judge erred in allowing testimony by three women at the landmark trial about uncharged allegations of sexual violence.\n\nFollowing his New York trial, at which a jury found him guilty of forcibly performing oral sex on Miriam Haley, a former production assistant, in 2006 and raping Jessica Mann, an aspiring actress, in 2013, he was sentenced to 23 years in prison. Weinstein was then tried in Los Angeles on separate charges, leading to his second conviction in December 2022 for rape and sexual assault and an additional 16-year sentence.\n\nHis successful appeal in New York had no bearing on his California conviction, which he is also appealing.\n\nAt a hearing last week, the DA's office said they may bring a superseding indictment, including new charges relating to victims unprepared to go through the legal process the last time. However, they have not yet presented evidence to a grand jury.\n\nMann is expected to take the stand at the retrial, according to prosecutors; Haley's lawyer, Gloria Allred, has said she has not yet made up her mind. Weinstein denies all allegations.\n\nThe once prolific movie producer's attorneys want him to wait for his retrial at Bellevue Hospital instead of Rikers Island, where he was initially transferred after the high court ruling overturning his first conviction. His lawyers say he is suffering from serious medical issues that are affecting his ability to participate in preparing his defense and that he requires a higher level of care than is available at the troubled jail complex.\n\nOutside the courthouse, Weinstein's lawyer, Diana Fabi Samson, said the \"Pulp Fiction\" producer is ready to go before a jury now.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we don't have the power to make that happen. The DA's office has made clear they are not ready to go to trial, they will not be ready in September,\" Samson said.\n\n\"(Weinstein) is anxious to go to trial and prove his innocence. ...

CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nHe was acquitted of first-degree rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault from actress Annabella Sciorra's allegations of rape in the 1990s. Weinstein has denied ever engaging in non-consensual sex.\n\nUltimately, the appeals court found that the trial judge should have only allowed witnesses to testify about the sexual assault encounters that Weinstein's charges stemmed from. During his trial, multiple women testified about sexual assaults allegedly performed by Weinstein, even though it wasn't what he faced charges for.\n\nAfter Weinstein's sentencing in New York in 2020, he was extradited to California in July 2021 to face sexual assault allegations made by four women in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills between 2004 and 2013.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nDue to the overturned conviction, California has requested Weinstein be extradited to begin serving out his 16-year sentence. Weinstein's team fought the extradition during a May 9 hearing.\n\n\"Our main concern in all of this is that Mr. Weinstein is here in New York, so we can prepare for trial and that he get the medical care he needs,\" Samson told reporters during a post-hearing press conference. \"And just concerned that travel ... would impact his health issues.\"\n\nShe later emphasized: \"He has very serious health issues. And I think it's also worth noting that since the day he was incarcerated, he has been in a hospital setting.\"\n\nSamson also noted that California is \"not in a position to extradite Mr. Weinstein because they have not done what they need to do.\"\n\nWeinstein's next hearing regarding the matter is August 7.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType":

after the New York Court of Appeals overturned his 2020 convictions for first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape in late April.\n\nAllegations initially surfaced against him in 2017 following a bombshell expos\u00e9 by the New York Times and The New Yorker, sparking the #MeToo movement, encouraging survivors of sexual assault -- especially by high-profile men in both Hollywood and the overall media industry -- to come forward.\n\nMore than 80 women have come forward with allegations of sexual abuse against Weinstein, who abused the women by wielding the power of his status in the industry.\n\nWeinstein currently remains incarcerated following his 2022 conviction of rape in Los Angeles, where he was sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2023.\n\nIf you or someone you know

He has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nProsecutors have said one of the accusers in that case, Jessica Mann, is prepared to testify against Weinstein again. Gloria Allred, a lawyer for the second accuser, Mimi Haley, said last week that her client hadn't yet decided whether to participate in the retrial.\n\nThe Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann did.\n\nWeinstein, 72, is jailed on Rikers Island. His attorney, Arthur Aidala, has complained that Weinstein hasn't been getting proper care in jail for diabetes, macular degeneration and fluid in his lungs and heart.\n\nWeinstein also was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape and is still sentenced to 16 years in prison in California. In an appeal filed there last month, his lawyers argued he didn't get a fair trial in that case.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The development comes three months after the disgraced Hollywood producer's initial New York 2020 convictions were overturned in April.\n\nOn Friday, Weinstein appeared briefly in a Manhattan courtroom and was seen using a wheelchair, wearing a suit and sporting black framed glasses and an American flag pin. Judge Curtis Farber also slotted jury selection for the retrial to start in November, with the discovery stage set for September.\n\nFollowing his courtroom visit, during which involved parties discussed evidence in the case, Weinstein's team spoke to reporters outside.\n\nOn behalf of his client, Weinstein's attorney Diana Fabi Samson said Weinstein is \"anxious to go to trial and prove his innocence.

Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, has affirmed that he plans to retry the case against Mr. Weinstein, who was sentenced to 16 years in prison in a separate sex-crimes case in Los Angeles and is currently being held at the Rikers Island jail complex.\n\nJustice Curtis Farber of State Supreme Court, who is presiding over the case, said at a hearing on Friday that he intended to keep the case moving, and wanted the schedule firmed up.\n\n\"As we progress toward the fall, I will start requesting commitments for trial dates,\" he said at the hearing.\n\nManhattan prosecutors said this month that they had identified allegations of rape and sexual assault against Mr. Weinstein that they planned to present to a grand jury. The accusations, some of which prosecutors were aware of at the time of the first trial, are based on events that occurred within the statute of limitations to bring charges, the prosecutors said.\n\nNicole Blumberg, an assistant district attorney, told the court last week that the women had previously not been ready to go forward, but that some were now ready. On Friday, Ms. Blumberg did not mention a new indictment or provide additional information about the allegations in question.\n\nMr. Weinstein, 72, was helped into court in a wheelchair on Friday. He was wearing a dark suit, a blue tie and dark rimmed glasses and was holding a brown folder.\n\nJustice Farber told the lawyers on both sides they would return to court in September after a hearing officer had helped him review evidence, and he set the tentative November trial date. John S. Esposito, one of Mr. Weinstein's lawyers, said the defense did not want to delay the trial and would be \"immediately ready\" in September.\n\nIn the past, Mr. Weinstein's lawyers have accused prosecutors of using delaying tactics to stall a new trial while their client's health deteriorates in jail.\n\nAt the height of Mr. Weinstein's power, he was viewed as a producer who could make careers. According to his accusers, he also wielded that power to harass and sexually assault women, many of whom were young and trying to establish themselves in the film industry.\n\nHe was indicted in Manhattan in 2018 on charges of rape and criminal sexual act. As that case was going to trial, prosecutors in Los Angeles charged him with raping one woman and groping and masturbating in front of a second in 2013.\n\nProsecutors said during the earlier Manhattan trial that Mr. Weinstein's history of assaults against women spanned decades. The judge allowed prosecutors to call witnesses who said Mr. Weinstein had assaulted them but whose accusations were not the basis for the charges against him.\n\nHe was convicted of raping one woman and committing a criminal sex act against another.

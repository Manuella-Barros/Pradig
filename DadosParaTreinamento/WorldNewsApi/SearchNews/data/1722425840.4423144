Vitale coached the Detroit Titans for four seasons before becoming the coach of the Detroit Pistons for the 1978-79 season, then was fired 12 games into the following season. He pivoted to broadcasting in time to announce the first-ever college basketball game shown on ESPN in 1979. He is a member of both the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and the College Basketball Hall of Fame. He has played versions of himself and other fictional sportscasters in movies like The Naked Gun, He Got Game, and Love & Basketball. Vitale frequently posts uplifting messages and videos to his followers on social media. On Friday, the same day that he announced his diagnosis, he said, \u201cFind something you have a passion about, that you have great love for. If you have love for something and a passion, your work ethic goes off the charts, and I know that you\u2019ll be a success. The key to life: find something you love, and do it to the best of your ability.\u201d \u201cKeep that head up high,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna drop it, it means that you didn\u2019t do a good job during that day. But if you did everything in your power to be a success, look at that mirror simply every day and say, \u2018I was better today than I was yesterday.\u2019 And when you do that on a regular basis, that will lead to big time, big time success.\u201d", "summary": "The sportscaster said he&#39;ll undergo a procedure to remove a lymph node in his neck next week.", "url": "https://ew.com/espn-broadcaster-dick-vitale-announces-he-has-cancer-8671572", "image": "https://ew.com/thmb/4NbCKhHODLnrMLk43fv3YX0l9xY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Dick-Vitale39-11152022-8787412c1caa44e5972fde998148e4d1.jpg", "video": "https://content.jwplatform.com/videos/xMuD6nMb-GQ0UtFMY.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:32:24", "author": "Wesley Stenzel", "authors": ["Wesley Stenzel"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.442}

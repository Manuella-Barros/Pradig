Ensure timely repayment of loan EMIs\n\nPaying your loan EMIs on time is crucial for maintaining a good credit score. Missing or delaying payments not only incurs penalties but also negatively impacts your credit score. Consider setting reminders or using Standing Instructions (SI) to automate your EMI payments and avoid any delays.\n\n2. Clear credit card dues promptly\n\nPlan strategically to settle your credit card balances by the due date to avoid negative impacts on your CIBIL score. Non-payment or regular defaults can significantly lower your score. If unable to clear the full amount, at least pay the minimum due to prevent adverse reporting on your credit report.\n\nAlso Check | Income Tax Slabs FY 2024-25 Explained: New Tax Regime Vs Old Tax Regime - What are the tax rates, slabs & surcharge rates?

Errors such as incorrect personal information, account details, or overdue amounts can be disputed and corrected online through the CIBIL grievance redressal process, potentially boosting your credit score.\n\n4. Limit multiple credit applications\n\nAvoid making several credit applications within a short period, as each application triggers a hard enquiry on your credit report. Multiple enquiries can signal financial distress to lenders and lower your credit score. Research and apply to only one provider after careful consideration.\n\n5. Consider a secured credit card\n\nIf your credit history is impacted by past defaults, consider applying for a secured credit card backed by a fixed deposit. Secured cards can be easier to obtain and using them responsibly by making timely payments can help rebuild your credit score over time.\n\nAlso Check | Post Office Savings Schemes Calculator: SSY, KVP, NSC, MIS, PPF, SCSS - How Much Will You Earn?

Monitor co-signed or joint loan accounts\n\nIf you've co-signed or guaranteed a loan, monitor its repayment status regularly.

But, while this factor might get most of the attention, there's an almost equally important one that can have a major impact: the credit utilization ratio.\n\nThe credit utilization ratio indicates the percentage of your revolving credit -- that is, credit cards and lines of credit -- you're currently using. And managing it wisely can be one of the quickest and most efficient ways to boost your score.\n\nAs we said above, your credit utilization ratio reflects how much of your revolving credit you're using at a given point in time -- that is, how much debt you owe versus how much credit you still have available.\n\nHere's what you need to know to manage it well.\n\nThis ratio is calculated by dividing your revolving credit debt by your total credit limit.\n\nFor example, if you have three credit cards and a line of credit, you should add up their respective credit limits and then how much you owe on them. Let's say their total credit limit is $20,000 and your outstanding balances add up to $10,000 -- if so, your credit utilization rate would be 50%. ($10,000 / $20,000 = 0.5)\n\nIt's often said that both lenders and credit bureaus prefer a credit utilization ratio below 30%. However, the truth is that much lower is better. In fact, according to data collected by credit bureau Experian in 2022, consumers with 'very good' (740-799) or 'exceptional' (800-850) FICO scores have 14.7% and 6.5% utilization rates, respectively.\n\nNote, however, that these top scorers don't have a 0% utilization rate. Many experts say that it's good to use some of your credit so that you can show a pattern of responsible usage.\n\nOne of the best -- and fastest -- ways to improve your credit score is by reducing your credit utilization ratio. Here are some ways you can do so:\n\nIf you have multiple credit cards and/or lines of credit, then you'll need to track how much you spend -- and how much credit you still have available. A good way to do this is by setting up balance alerts with your card issuer, which will notify you when you've passed a certain spending threshold.\n\nAvoid maxing out any of your cards, which will have a significantly negative impact on your score. And, if you find your utilization rate is too high -- that is, 30% or higher -- then it's time to pay down that balance as much as you can. Make sure to read our guide to How to pay off credit card debt for tips on how to do just that.\n\nIf you have a history of on-time payments and your income has risen substantially from when you first got the credit card, you have a good chance of negotiating a higher credit limit with your card issuer.\n\nMany banks allow cardholders to request a higher credit limit online by logging into their account. However, you can also call and talk to a customer service representative. This could be a better choice as it allows you to discuss your financial information thoroughly and, hopefully, persuasively. You should be prepared to provide income and work history information, along with other personal information.\n\nOnce you have a higher credit limit, you should monitor your spending and make sure you keep credit utilization low -- in the single digits if possible.\n\nLastly, paying your card early could help reduce your credit utilization rate and improve your score.\n\nCredit cards have a statement closing date, which marks the end of your billing cycle. This is the day when lenders send your monthly bill. It's also usually around the same time they report your account details to the credit bureaus.\n\nIf you pay down your balance before your closing date, you could reduce the credit usage reported to the bureaus and potentially boost your score.\n\nYou can typically find your card's closing date on your monthly statement or through your online banking account. You could also call the customer service number on the back of your credit card and ask.", "source": {"uri": "money.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Money"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Line of credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Revolving credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_limit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit limit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Credit score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_bureau", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit bureau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experian", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Experian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit score in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_banking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online banking"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://img.money.com/2024/07/Explainer-Credit-Utilization.jpg?quality=85", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720733", "eventUri": "eng-9720733", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6235294117647059, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

It remains on your credit report for up to seven years, impacting your ability to secure favorable financing terms in the future.\n\nA vehicle is one of the most important assets you can have, especially if you live in a city without a robust public transportation system. Unfortunately, vehicle prices have risen steadily, leaving consumers paying an average of $738 per month for their new cars.\n\nWith prices so high, it's easy to get behind on your monthly payments, putting yourself at risk of a repossession. Read on to learn how much a car repossession will hurt your credit.\n\nWhat Is a Repossession?\n\nAn auto loan is a type of secured debt, which means it's backed by collateral. In financial lingo, collateral is a valuable asset used to secure a loan. If you don't pay the loan as agreed, the lender has the right to take back -- repossess -- the asset, sell it, and use the proceeds to cover your debt.\n\nA lender usually has the right to repossess your vehicle after a single missed payment, but it may give you up to 90 days to catch up. If your lender gives you extra time, do whatever you can to avoid the repo. Work more hours, pick up a second job, or borrow money from a family member.\n\nIf you don't submit the full amount due by the cutoff, your lender may have a repo company pick up the vehicle. Repo agents, also known as recovery agents, use a variety of tactics to repossess vehicles. For example, a repo company may send a tow truck to your house and have the vehicle towed away when you least expect it.\n\nHow Much Will a Car Repossession Hurt My Credit Score?\n\nA car repossession itself doesn't hurt your credit, but the late payments and collection account that presumably led to the repossession will. The exact impact on your score will depend on several factors, such as how high your score is, what your payment history looks like, and the number of credit accounts you have. If you want to know where your credit stands, check your FICO\u00ae credit scores or your VantageScore.\n\nIt's also a good idea to check your reports from the three major credit reporting agencies. Checking your reports makes it easier to spot fraud and keep track of the negative items on your record.\n\nHow Long Does a Repo Stay on Your Credit?\n\nGenerally, your late payments and collection accounts can stay on your credit report for up to seven years. The good news is that you don't have to wait that long to start fixing your credit.\n\nHow to Fix Credit After a Car Repossession\n\nFollow these tips to build a stronger credit profile while you wait for negative items to fall off your credit reports.\n\n1. Make On-Time Payments\n\nPayment history is by far the most important factor used to calculate your credit scores. A car repo indicates you have a history of missing payments, but it's possible to turn things around by changing your behavior. The first step is to figure out why you missed those payments.\n\nIf you missed several car payments due to a lack of income, now's the time to look for a higher-paying job or think about starting a side hustle. The more income you have coming in, the less likely you are to miss payments in the future.\n\nSome people miss payments because they're less organized and have a hard time remembering their due dates. Fortunately, hundreds of tools are available to help you gain control of your finances. Consider setting up automatic payments or using a mobile budgeting app to avoid late payments after a repo.\n\n2. Avoid Taking on Too Much Debt\n\nThe more debt you have, the more difficult it is to manage your finances. After all, when you use a credit card or take out a loan, you have to pay back what you borrowed. If you avoid taking on too much debt, you're less likely to have trouble meeting your financial obligations.\n\nAvoiding excess debt is also a great way to keep your credit utilization ratio in check. This ratio compares how much revolving credit you're using to your available credit limit. For example, if you have $5,000 of total available credit and you're carrying a balance of $1,000, you have a credit utilization ratio of 20%. Try to aim for a utilization ratio below 30% to show lenders you use your credit wisely.\n\n3. Apply for Credit Sparingly\n\nAnother way to improve your credit score is to apply for credit only when you need it. For example, if you're planning on traveling a lot, you may want to apply for a travel credit card to earn frequent-flier miles or get cash back on your travel expenses.\n\nIf you don't absolutely need credit, don't apply for it. Every time you fill out an application, the lender does a credit check, which causes a hard inquiry to appear on at least one of your reports. Too many hard inquiries in a short amount of time is a red flag, as lenders may think you're in a financial bind and need a bunch of credit to bail yourself out.\n\n4. Apply for a Credit-Building Product\n\nThe negative items that lead to a car repossession, such as late payments and collection accounts, can have a major impact on your credit, so you may not qualify for standard credit cards or loans for a while. Fortunately, many companies offer credit-building products designed to help consumers recover from financial setbacks.\n\nFor example, some banks offer secured credit cards, which are a bit different from traditional credit cards. With a secured card, you establish a credit limit by making a cash deposit. For example, if you deposit $500, the issuer will give you a spending limit of $500. If you use your secured card responsibly, the bank may convert it to an unsecured card after several months.\n\nIt's also possible to take out a credit-builder loan, which is like a traditional loan in reverse. Normally, you borrow a lump sum of money and pay it back over time. With a credit-builder loan, you make payments first. Once you've made your payments as agreed, the lender gives you the money.\n\nYour credit won't recover overnight, but it can improve over time if you develop good habits and manage your finances wisely.

When used responsibly, credit cards can provide numerous benefits that can make your life easier and more convenient. In this blog, we'll explore some significant benefits of using credit cards.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of credit cards is their financial flexibility and convenience. With a credit card, you don't need to carry cash everywhere you go. You can use your card to pay for purchases big and small, online and in stores.\n\nThis saves you the hassle of having to withdraw cash before every expense. You also don't need to worry if you are short on money at any given moment - you can use your credit card.\n\nUsing a credit card responsibly can help build your credit score over time. Your credit score is important because lenders use it to evaluate your creditworthiness. The higher your score, the better interest rates and loan terms you can qualify for.\n\nMaking on-time payments every month demonstrates that you are a reliable borrower and contributes to an improved credit history. In contrast, missing payments can drastically lower your credit score and make borrowing more expensive.\n\nMany credit cards offer attractive rewards programs and cashback on purchases. Rewards can include points, miles, cashback, and more on every dollar you spend. These rewards can then be redeemed for statement credits, merchandise, gift cards, airline tickets, hotel stays, and much more.\n\nThe right travel rewards credit card allows you to take free vacations with your family, using points earned through your normal spending. Cashback credit cards put money directly into your wallet on everything you buy.\n\nCredit cards provide various purchase protections and extended warranty coverage for items you buy with your card. For example, purchases are often covered if the item is damaged or stolen within a specific time frame after purchase. You may also get extended warranty protection beyond the manufacturer's warranty. This can protect you from costly repairs or replacing items that break or fail sooner than expected. Credit card purchase protection can save you money and give you extra peace of mind.\n\nOne of the useful benefits of credit cards is the ability to set up standing instructions for automatic payments towards recurring expenses. Once you set up standing instructions, the credit card provider will automatically pay the bills from your credit card as and when they come due every month. This saves you the hassle of manually making payments each month.\n\nIf you travel frequently, many credit cards offer valuable benefits and perks that can improve your travel experience. These can include free checked baggage on flights, airline priority boarding, discounts or upgrades at hotels, rental car insurance, airport lounge access, and more.\n\nTravel points earned through credit card rewards programs can be used to book free flights and hotel rooms. For frequent travellers, these benefits can add up substantially over time to reduce the cost of travel.\n\nMost credit cards offer interest-free credit on purchases. You pay no interest charges as long as your outstanding balance is paid in full each month by the due date. This grace period allows responsible credit card users to access short-term financing for free.\n\nOver time, a history of on-time credit card bill payments demonstrates good financial habits and allows you to qualify for better credit cards with higher limits and attractive rewards programs.\n\nHaving access to credit cards can also help you deal with unexpected emergencies. Most households need meaningful emergency savings. A large unexpected home repair, medical bill, or major car repair can be financially devastating without a credit card. Credit cards give users access to revolving lines of credit that can be used for emergency financing. While credit card debt is expensive in the long term, having it as a backup emergency funding option helps many households avoid even worse situations when disaster strikes.\n\nJust be sure to have a plan to pay off any balances incurred over time. The goal with credit card emergencies should be to bridge the gap until you can free up cash through other means.\n\nMany credit cards offer additional perks and benefits, such as concierge services for booking travel, discounts on everyday purchases, free access to airport lounges, special financing offers, and more. These extra perks and deals can add up depending on your spending habits and lifestyle.\n\nBe sure to take advantage of all the benefits that may be available with your credit cards to maximise their overall value in your financial life.\n\nCredit cards can provide many valuable financial benefits when used wisely in a responsible financial plan. Convenience, flexibility, emergency backup, free travel, cashback rewards, purchase protections, and fraud security are just a few reasons credit cards have become so ubiquitous today. Maximising these advantages while avoiding interest charges and overspending is critical to harnessing the full benefits of credit cards in both the short and long run.\n\nVisit AU Small Finance Bank website today to know more about credit cards!", "source": {"uri": "chiangraitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTN News l Chiang Rai Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warranty", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warranty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debtor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Debtor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loyalty program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_lounge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport lounge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_rental", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Car rental"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_ticket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airline ticket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_period", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grace period"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Line of credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Phone_Cards_-_Phone_Service_Reps", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Phone Cards - Phone Service Reps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Trading Cards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.chiangraitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/The-Benefits-of-Using-Credit-Cards.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720733", "eventUri": "eng-9720733", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Nearly half of adults (46%) are even unaware of their current financial rating.\n\nGood credit-worthiness can open doors to numerous benefits, including access to better borrowing terms, lower interest rates, and increased chances of successful loan applications. Latest statistics reveal that approximately one-in-five Brits have a poor credit rating.\n\nHowever, there's a silver lining as there are several methods to enhance your score, including opting for car finance. Jonathan Such, head of sales at vehicle finance company First Response Finance, has now revealed how it can bolster your credit score, establish credit history, create a positive payment footprint and more, reports the Daily Record.\n\nIt's crucial to understand that while this is a high-value purchase on credit, there are other ways to improve your credit score such as registering on the electoral roll.\n\nEstablishing credit history\n\nOne of the key advantages of opting for car finance is that it can help establish a longer credit history. This is particularly true for motorists who are new to credit or have a limited credit history.\n\nJonathan Such stated: \"Buying a car is often one of the first significant investments you make, particularly if you've passed your test at a young age and are looking to hit the road as soon as you get hold of your driving licence.\"\n\n\"There's a chance that, at this stage of your life, you may have limited credit history - or no history at all. In this scenario, a car loan can kickstart your credit profile, making it easier for you in the future to obtain other forms of credit.\"\n\n\"In fact, length of credit history is an important factor in the eyes of a lender, and it can actually makeup 15% to 20% of your credit score.\"\n\nBuild a positive payment history\n\nAs well as helping (younger) drivers get on the credit ladder, taking out car finance allows you to build a positive payment history.\n\nSticking to your monthly instalments and making on-time payments will work wonders on your credit rating, as it shows you have the ability to manage and keep up with your bills. This is something that future lenders will consider carefully when deciding whether to give you a loan or not.\n\nUltimately, finance providers are more likely to lend you money if they can see that you've been able to keep up with regular payments in the past.\n\nShow financial responsibility\n\nIn line with the above, making your monthly payments on time and building a positive payment history through car finance can demonstrate financial responsibility and creditworthiness.\n\nJonathan stated: \"Successfully managing a car loan will show that you're a reliable borrower. It indicates that you're able to meet deadlines and respect agreement terms, meaning you aren't a risk to credit lenders.\"\n\nHe added: \"Reliability and responsibility are things that finance providers take into serious consideration when evaluating an application. A good track record of timely payments can make the difference between a successful and rejected loan request.\"\n\n\"Demonstrating trustworthiness by fulfilling your car finance payments can be extremely beneficial if you plan to apply for other types of credit, such as personal loans or mortgages.\"\n\nShow a diverse credit mix\n\nA 'credit mix' refers to different types of loans you've taken out.\n\nSimply put, there are two forms of credit - instalment and revolving. The former consists of loans that have fixed monthly repayments and a set end date, such as car finance.\n\nThe latter, on the other hand, is a type of loan that has a minimum monthly repayment figure but no specific end date or balance (i. e.\n\n, credit cards).\n\nCredit scoring models tend to favour borrowers with a diverse credit mix, as it proves that they're able to manage different types of loans and credits.\n\nSecuring car finance and incorporating instalment credit into your file can enhance your credit rating, thereby improving your 'reputation' amongst potential lenders.", "source": {"uri": "bristolpost.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bristol Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "linda_howard@bristolpost.co.uk", "name": "Linda Howard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "kieran_isgin@bristolpost.co.uk", "name": "Kieran Isgin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Car finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsecured_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unsecured debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debtor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Debtor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Insurance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article9401155.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_HiJOBS-report.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720733", "eventUri": "eng-9720733", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

More than half of them now monitor their credit reports and scores doing it to improve their credit scores.\n\nIn addition to 51% monitoring their credit to improve their credit scores, 29% monitor their credit report with the goal of paying down debt and preventing fraud activities, while 20% do so in anticipation of opening new credit accounts. This is according to a new TransUnion global study to better understand the distinct profiles, motivations and outcomes of credit monitoring consumers.\n\nThe global research study examined the credit behaviour of millions of consumers in developed and developing markets in South Africa, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Hong Kong, India, the Philippines, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nTo further identify how these benefits advance credit education and enable financial inclusion, the study used depersonalised credit data to analyse these outcomes for key consumer credit segments: New-to-Credit, underserved and credit-served consumers.\n\n\"Consumer credit monitoring expanded considerably in awareness and usage over the past decade. This expansion was fuelled by the impact of the pandemic on consumer finances, the current high-interest rate, high inflation environment and consumers' heightened awareness of taking steps to avoid becoming victims of credit fraud,\" says Nidhi Verma, co-author of the study and head of international research and consulting at TransUnion.\n\nALSO READ: Times have never been tougher for consumers, which is why they do not save\n\n\"Our study measures the importance of credit education and quantifies the benefits that credit monitoring consumers experience. These benefits are shown to lead to better credit profiles, greater access to credit, or an improved ability to pay down debt, depending on the intent of consumers who monitor credit.\"\n\nIn South Africa, 85% of surveyed consumers stated that it is at least moderately important to monitor their credit, with more than a third (36%) saying it's extremely important. This finding demonstrated that consumer awareness of credit monitoring is high and is a likely driver behind the surge in monitoring activity in recent years.\n\nTransUnion surveyed consumers to understand their initial intent to sign up for credit monitoring services and the actual benefits they experienced. The most common reasons South African consumers initially signed up for credit monitoring services were that they were trying to improve their credit score (47%), to learn about credit offers they may qualify for (33%) and to monitor their report for accuracy (31%).\n\nAdditionally, after using monitoring services for some time, consumers reported realising added benefits. These include that credit monitoring has allowed them to learn how to monitor and manage their credit score (55%), make regular payments (42%), and pay down debt (34%).\n\nALSO READ: More SA consumers battling to pay their home loans and credit cards - report\n\nThe study further identified three distinct segments of credit-monitoring consumers based on their primary motivation for monitoring their credit. These include Credit Improvers, Credit Seekers and Credit Managers.\n\nCredit Improvers, who make up 51% of the South African credit monitoring population, are defined as consumers with subprime (poor) credit scores who likely use credit monitoring to understand their current credit situations and take steps to improve their credit scores. The study found that Credit Improvers in South Africa generally experienced larger credit score improvements one year after they started monitoring their credit than consumers who have no history of credit monitoring.\n\nIn addition to improving scores, credit monitoring subprime consumers are looking to improve their delinquencies, by better understanding their obligations and how their payments impact their credit scores.\n\nWith that in mind, TransUnion found that those who monitor credit cured their delinquent credit card accounts - meaning they improved their account status from past due to current - at a three percentage points higher rate than those who do not monitor credit.\n\nALSO READ: The link between your money mindset and your credit score\n\nThis improvement in cure rates was observed amongst consumers who were delinquent before signing up for self-credit monitoring and subsequently became current on their overdue payments within the first three, six, or 12 months of monitoring credit.\n\n\"The volume of South African consumers enrolled in credit monitoring tools for the first time with TransUnion has been growing steadily for years. Credit Improvers are the largest segment of credit monitoring consumers in South Africa and tend to see some of the most impactful benefits in terms of credit profile improvement,\" Lee Naik, CEO of TransUnion Africa, says.\n\n\"It is a clear indication that consumers who are actively looking to improve their credit standing may achieve better results if they monitor their credit and are able to plan their financial obligations and track their progress.\"", "source": {"uri": "citizen.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Citizen"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ina_opperman@citizen.co.za", "name": "Ina Opperman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_report_monitoring", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit report monitoring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransUnion", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TransUnion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guatemala"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Guatemala"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_lending", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subprime lending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Education and Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://media.citizen.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/credit-report.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720733", "eventUri": "eng-9720733", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Credit cards are convenient, more secure in some ways than cash or debit, and may even earn you rewards. But they can also be extremely expensive.\n\nFor You: Barbara Corcoran's 5 Best Passive Income Ideas\n\nFind Out: 7 Reasons You Should Consider a Financial Advisor -- Even If You're Not Wealthy\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) found that the average annual percentage rate (APR) on a credit card was 22.8% last year -- nearly twice what it was a decade prior. Credit card companies earn billions of dollars a year on interest charges alone, not to mention other fees.\n\nIf you're thinking about buying groceries with your credit card, do so with a plan in mind. That way, you can get the most benefits with the least amount of hassle or fees.\n\nGOBankingRates spoke with two financial planners -- Josh Richner, founder and senior debt advisor at FaithWorks Financial, and Taylor Kovar, CFP and CEO at 11 Financial -- about the top things to consider when using your credit card to buy groceries. Here's what they said.\n\nWealthy people know the best money secrets. Learn how to copy them.\n\nIf you're using your credit card because you want to get those rewards and you know you can pay off your monthly balance, then by all means. But if you use it because you're struggling financially, that could be a sign of a bigger problem.\n\n\"If you find yourself regularly using a credit card to buy groceries out of necessity, it's a sign that you may be overextended financially,\" said Richner. \"This situation demands a closer look at your overall financial health to identify and address underlying issues.\"\n\nReview your monthly bank statements, credit card statements, loan payments, and any other regular expenses you have. Then, make a budget -- either manually or via a free budgeting app -- based on your income and expenses. If you're having trouble financially, look for any areas where you can cut costs and put that money toward your groceries (or credit card bill) instead.\n\nTrending Now: 6 Clothing Items Frugal People Keep for Many Years\n\nRight up there with considering your financial health is making sure you can handle your credit card payments. This means more than just paying the minimums -- it means paying off your balance in full each month.\n\n\"Paying off the full balance avoids incurring interest from month to month,\" said Kovar. \"Be cautious of carrying a balance that can lead to interest charges [and] outweigh the potential benefits.\"\n\n\"Groceries are a recurring expense, and if you are not able to pay off your credit card balance in full each month, the interest and fees can quickly add up,\" Richner added. \"This makes your groceries significantly more expensive over time.\"\n\nCheck your card's interest rate and any other fees. While you're at it, find out when your card actually accrues interest. This doesn't always happen on the payment due date, so you could end up paying interest even if you do make the full payment.\n\nHaving a convenient payment method can be a double-edged sword when it comes to food quality, too. If you're running your card at places like convenience stores or buying unhealthy snacks just because you can, you could be hurting your overall health. This can also happen if you're purchasing these foods because they're the only thing you can afford.\n\n\"When debt and debt repayment cause us to sacrifice the quantity or quality of our food choices, it is directly impeding our physical health,\" said Richner. \"Ensuring you have access to nutritious food is crucial for maintaining overall well-being.\"\n\nTake a good look at the foods you're actually purchasing and make sure they work with whatever personal health and wellness -- and financial -- goals you have. Regardless of how you pay for them, it might be time for a change if they don't.\n\n\"People should also consider the rewards and benefits accompanied by grocery purchases that their cards may offer,\" said Kovar. \"Some credit cards offer benefits such as rewards or possible cash back with grocery purchases that can add up to savings.\"\n\nMany major credit cards also come with perks ranging from fraud protection, which can keep your money and identity safe, to travel points. Having these perks can be great, but you'll still want to consider the benefits alongside the potential risks or costs.\n\nIn particular, Kovar advised against carrying a balance since the interest charges can eat into any possible savings or cashback rewards you might get.\n\nYour credit score has a big impact on your credit card limit and interest rate, as well as the types of cards -- like rewards cards -- you qualify for. But your credit card usage also affects your credit score.\n\nYour FICO credit score consists of five main categories -- amounts owed, new credit, payment history, length of credit history, and credit mix. From this, 35% of your score is based on your payment history.

Credit cards are convenient, more secure in some ways than cash or debit, and may even earn you rewards. But they can also be extremely expensive.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) found that the average annual percentage rate (APR) on a credit card was 22.8% last year -- nearly twice what it was a decade prior. Credit card companies earn billions of dollars a year on interest charges alone, not to mention other fees.\n\nIf you're thinking about buying groceries with your credit card, do so with a plan in mind. That way, you can get the most benefits with the least amount of hassle or fees.\n\nGOBankingRates spoke with two financial planners -- Josh Richner, founder and senior debt advisor at FaithWorks Financial, and Taylor Kovar, CFP and CEO at 11 Financial -- about the top things to consider when using your credit card to buy groceries. Here's what they said.\n\nIf you're using your credit card because you want to get those rewards and you know you can pay off your monthly balance, then by all means. But if you use it because you're struggling financially, that could be a sign of a bigger problem.\n\n\"If you find yourself regularly using a credit card to buy groceries out of necessity, it's a sign that you may be overextended financially,\" said Richner. \"This situation demands a closer look at your overall financial health to identify and address underlying issues.\"\n\nReview your monthly bank statements, credit card statements, loan payments, and any other regular expenses you have. Then, make a budget -- either manually or via a free budgeting app -- based on your income and expenses. If you're having trouble financially, look for any areas where you can cut costs and put that money toward your groceries (or credit card bill) instead.\n\nRight up there with considering your financial health is making sure you can handle your credit card payments. This means more than just paying the minimums -- it means paying off your balance in full each month.\n\n\"Paying off the full balance avoids incurring interest from month to month,\" said Kovar. \"Be cautious of carrying a balance that can lead to interest charges [and] outweigh the potential benefits.\"\n\n\"Groceries are a recurring expense, and if you are not able to pay off your credit card balance in full each month, the interest and fees can quickly add up,\" Richner added. \"This makes your groceries significantly more expensive over time.\"\n\nCheck your card's interest rate and any other fees. While you're at it, find out when your card actually accrues interest. This doesn't always happen on the payment due date, so you could end up paying interest even if you do make the full payment.\n\nHaving a convenient payment method can be a double-edged sword when it comes to food quality, too. If you're running your card at places like convenience stores or buying unhealthy snacks just because you can, you could be hurting your overall health. This can also happen if you're purchasing these foods because they're the only thing you can afford.\n\n\"When debt and debt repayment cause us to sacrifice the quantity or quality of our food choices, it is directly impeding our physical health,\" said Richner. \"Ensuring you have access to nutritious food is crucial for maintaining overall well-being.\"\n\nTake a good look at the foods you're actually purchasing and make sure they work with whatever personal health and wellness -- and financial -- goals you have. Regardless of how you pay for them, it might be time for a change if they don't.\n\n\"People should also consider the rewards and benefits accompanied by grocery purchases that their cards may offer,\" said Kovar. \"Some credit cards offer benefits such as rewards or possible cash back with grocery purchases that can add up to savings.\"\n\nMany major credit cards also come with perks ranging from fraud protection, which can keep your money and identity safe, to travel points. Having these perks can be great, but you'll still want to consider the benefits alongside the potential risks or costs.\n\nIn particular, Kovar advised against carrying a balance since the interest charges can eat into any possible savings or cashback rewards you might get.\n\nYour credit score has a big impact on your credit card limit and interest rate, as well as the types of cards -- like rewards cards -- you qualify for. But your credit card usage also affects your credit score.\n\nYour FICO credit score consists of five main categories -- amounts owed, new credit, payment history, length of credit history, and credit mix. From this, 35% of your score is based on your payment history. This means you could build credit if you can reliably make those on-time payments.\n\nAnother 30% of your score is based on your credit utilization (amounts owed). If you consistently carry a high balance on your card, you could be hurting your score rather than building it up.\n\n\"Using credit cards responsibly with any expenses can help maintain a healthy credit score, and avoid unnecessary interest charges,\" said Kovar.\n\nThis applies not only to your grocery purchases, but to any other expense you charge to your card.", "source": {"uri": "gobankingrates.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GOBankingRates"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_percentage_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Annual percentage rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_planner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial planner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Financial_Protection_Bureau", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer Financial Protection Bureau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senior debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Debit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Budget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FICO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FICO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/woman-using-her-rewards-card-in-grocery-store-iStock-610661340.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720733", "eventUri": "eng-9720733", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

A high credit score facilitates easier access to credit cards and loans, often at lower interest rates and with additional benefits. Conversely, a low CIBIL score poses significant challenges for individuals seeking urgent credit. Lenders typically reject applications from those with a poor credit score (600 or below), or approve them with higher interest rates.Improving your CIBIL score requires diligent adherence to specific strategies to enhance creditworthiness.\n\nImproving your credit score takes time and consistent effort. By following these, you can gradually enhance your CIBIL score and improve your chances of accessing credit facilities in the future.\n\nStrategies to boost your CIBIL score\n\n1. Ensure timely repayment of loan EMIs\n\nPaying your loan EMIs on time is crucial for maintaining a good credit score. Missing or delaying payments not only incurs penalties but also negatively impacts your credit score. Consider setting reminders or using Standing Instructions (SI) to automate your EMI payments and avoid any delays.\n\n2. Clear credit card dues promptly\n\nPlan strategically to settle your credit card balances by the due date to avoid negative impacts on your CIBIL score. Non-payment or regular defaults can significantly lower your score. If unable to clear the full amount, at least pay the minimum due to prevent adverse reporting on your credit report.\n\nAlso Check | Income Tax Slabs FY 2024-25 Explained: New Tax Regime Vs Old Tax Regime - What are the tax rates, slabs & surcharge rates? Find out\n\n3. Review and correct errors in your CIBIL report\n\nRegularly check your CIBIL report for any inaccuracies that could be affecting your credit score. Errors such as incorrect personal information, account details, or overdue amounts can be disputed and corrected online through the CIBIL grievance redressal process, potentially boosting your credit score.\n\n4. Limit multiple credit applications\n\nAvoid making several credit applications within a short period, as each application triggers a hard enquiry on your credit report. Multiple enquiries can signal financial distress to lenders and lower your credit score. Research and apply to only one provider after careful consideration.\n\n5. Consider a secured credit card\n\nIf your credit history is impacted by past defaults, consider applying for a secured credit card backed by a fixed deposit. Secured cards can be easier to obtain and using them responsibly by making timely payments can help rebuild your credit score over time.\n\nAlso Check | Post Office Savings Schemes Calculator: SSY, KVP, NSC, MIS, PPF, SCSS - How Much Will You Earn?

Longer credit histories and consistent repayment records can positively influence your creditworthiness and support future credit applications.\n\n7. Monitor co-signed or joint loan accounts\n\nIf you've co-signed or guaranteed a loan, monitor its repayment status regularly. Any defaults or delays in payments can affect both the borrower's and co-signer's credit scores. Communicate with the borrower to ensure timely repayments.\n\nThe TOI Business Desk is a vigilant and dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant business news from around the world to readers of The Times of India.

However, its impact on your credit score lessens over time as you rebuild your credit with responsible financial behavior.\n\nWhile bankruptcy may be a last resort, there are times where filing bankruptcy might make sense. Before you make this decision, it's important to understand the impact a bankruptcy can have on your credit and how long it remains on your credit report. You'll also want to know when and how to remove bankruptcies from credit reports.\n\nThis guide provides more information about bankruptcies and the impact a bankruptcy could have on your financial future.\n\nThere are two primary types of consumer bankruptcies: Chapter 7 and Chapter 13.\n\nA Chapter 7 bankruptcy is a full liquidation of your assets. All eligible debts are settled and no repayment plan is put in place. Depending on your specific situation, you could walk away from a Chapter 7 bankruptcy without any remaining debt.\n\nHowever, 7 bankruptcies can remain on your credit report and affect your credit for up to 10 years from the date of filing.\n\nWhile some of your debt will be resolved with a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you'll still have to repay a portion of your overdue balances. This type of bankruptcy restructures your debt and can force your creditors to settle for a reduced amount. The court sets up a repayment plan that typically stretches over three to five years.\n\nChapter 13 bankruptcies can remain on your credit report for up to seven years from the date of filing. At this point, the bankruptcy should be removed from your credit report.\n\nOnce your bankruptcy is officially filed through the courts, it typically cannot be removed from your credit reports earlier than the seven- or 10-year time frame unless it contains errors or was reported incorrectly.\n\nBe sure to review the details of your bankruptcy on your credit reports. Make sure all the information is correct, such as your name, Social Security number, personal information, and filing date. If you note any mistakes about your bankruptcy on any of your credit reports, you can file a dispute with the relevant credit bureaus.\n\nOnce you file a dispute, the credit bureaus have 30 to 45 days to verify and validate the information. If they fail to do so, they should remove the bankruptcy from your credit reports.\n\nWhile your bankruptcy will remain on your credit report for seven or 10 years, this doesn't mean you have to wait that long to get credit again. In fact, some creditors may be willing to work with you just a few years after a bankruptcy. For example, you may qualify for a secured credit card in just a few short years. However, you may face higher-than-average interest rates.\n\nThe important thing is to refrain from falling back into the habits that may have led to your bankruptcy. This means setting and following firm budget constraints. Next, you'll want to start rebuilding your credit as soon as possible.\n\nWhile you don't want to file for bankruptcy unless you absolutely must, it does provide a chance to start over. There's a good likelihood that you also have missed payments and account defaults on your credit report, which are what led you to file for bankruptcy in the first place. These negative items could also remain on your credit report for up to seven years.\n\nFortunately, during this time, you can work to rebuild your credit. Here are some tips to help you get started.\n\nThe first step to rebuilding your credit is assessing your current financial state. Use Credit.com's free credit report card to get an overview of your situation. Then, check the report for accuracy, and challenge any errors you may find.\n\nIf any unresolved issues on your credit score aren't covered under your bankruptcy, create a plan to pay this debt off as quickly as possible or contact the creditor to negotiate a payment deal. Be sure to check your credit reports frequently so you can immediately address any issues that arise.\n\nOne of the best ways to get control of your finances and prevent overspending is to set a firm budget. First, determine your monthly net income. Next, calculate your expenses. Do your best to set a budget that utilizes no more than 80% of your net income.\n\nThis practice allows you to put up to 20% of your income into an emergency savings fund. This safety net can prevent missed payments in the future.\n\nYour payment history accounts for up to 35% of your overall FICO\u00ae credit score. If you want to start rebuilding your credit, it's crucial you make your payments on time, every time. Creating a budget and making a commitment to stick to this budget can help.\n\nUnfortunately, some of your most common monthly payments, such as your rent and utilities, aren't always reported to the credit reporting agencies. This means you're not getting credit for making these payments. Credit.com's ExtraCredit\u00ae Build It program can help you make the most of every payment. Sign up today to start getting credit for things like rental payments and utility bills.\n\nAfter some time has passed and you've taken steps to rebuild your credit, you may qualify for a new credit card. Start your search with a secured credit card. This step can help improve your credit by diversifying your credit mix and helping you add to your positive payment history.\n\nWhile filing for bankruptcy can have significant consequences, it won't impact your credit forever.

The average household credit card balance was $10,479 at the end of the first quarter of 2024.\n\n\"U.S. consumers do want to pay off their credit card debt. They just can't seem to get any momentum,\" WalletHub editor John Kiernan said in an email statement. \"Nearly 1 in 4 people claim to be 'very stressed' about what they owe. Yet around one-third of people expect to have more credit card debt by year's end. At some point, something has to give. Let's just hope it doesn't topple the economy when it happens.\"\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve data reported on Monday that outstanding debt rose 5 percent during the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. This shows that U.S. consumers are responding to inflation in part by increasing their debt.\n\nWhile inflation has cooled to much lower levels than were seen in the past few years, consumers are still feeling the pinch of higher prices, which have increased an average of nearly 20 percent since 2021.\n\nIf May 2024's total credit card debt numbers had not been adjusted for inflation, they would have gone up 7 percent over last May rather than 4 percent, representing a new record.\n\nWalletHub suggested some steps to take for those who find themselves deeper in debt than they were last year. Making a budget can help consumers rein in unnecessary expenses and follow through on paying off credit cards instead of using them more. Building an emergency fund helps people use cash to pay for unexpected expenses rather than take on additional debt, which often means using credit cards.\n\nOther steps consumers can take are to pay off debts with higher interest rates first, look for a higher-paying job, or get a side hustle to pay off debt faster.\n\nWhile a high debt-to-income ratio can lower a person's credit score, it's important to check credit reports periodically for inaccurate data that can result in higher interest rates for new and existing debt.\n\nWalletHub reported that complaints about credit cards to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were up more than 43 percent over 2023. The CFPB also had a 280 percent increase in complaints about credit reporting.\n\nThe latest inflation numbers suggest that prices may be stabilizing, which is one signal that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates in the near future.

The average household credit card balance was $10,479 at the end of the first quarter of 2024.\n\n\"U.S. consumers do want to pay off their credit card debt. They just can't seem to get any momentum,\" WalletHub editor John Kiernan said in an email statement. \"Nearly 1 in 4 people claim to be 'very stressed' about what they owe. Yet around one-third of people expect to have more credit card debt by year's end. At some point, something has to give. Let's just hope it doesn't topple the economy when it happens.\"\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve data reported on Monday that outstanding debt rose 5 percent during the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. This shows that U.S. consumers are responding to inflation in part by increasing their debt.\n\nWhile inflation has cooled to much lower levels than were seen in the past few years, consumers are still feeling the pinch of higher prices, which have increased an average of nearly 20 percent since 2021.\n\nIf May 2024's total credit card debt numbers had not been adjusted for inflation, they would have gone up 7 percent over last May rather than 4 percent, representing a new record.\n\nWalletHub suggested some steps to take for those who find themselves deeper in debt than they were last year. Making a budget can help consumers rein in unnecessary expenses and follow through on paying off credit cards instead of using them more. Building an emergency fund helps people use cash to pay for unexpected expenses rather than take on additional debt, which often means using credit cards.\n\nOther steps consumers can take are to pay off debts with higher interest rates first, look for a higher-paying job, or get a side hustle to pay off debt faster.\n\nWhile a high debt-to-income ratio can lower a person's credit score, it's important to check credit reports periodically for inaccurate data that can result in higher interest rates for new and existing debt.\n\nWalletHub reported that complaints about credit cards to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were up more than 43 percent over 2023. The CFPB also had a 280 percent increase in complaints about credit reporting.\n\nThe latest inflation numbers suggest that prices may be stabilizing, which is one signal that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates in the near future. Morgan Stanley has predicted a rate cut in September, which could bring credit card interest rates back down at least a bit.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankrate", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bankrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WalletHub", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WalletHub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-income_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Debt-to-income ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Financial_Protection_Bureau", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer Financial Protection Bureau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Stanley"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Phone_Cards_-_Phone_Service_Reps", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Phone Cards - Phone Service Reps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Trading Cards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.ntd.com/assets/uploads/2023/11/id951830-GettyImages-87874564.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720733", "eventUri": "eng-9720733", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2009-05-20", "textStart": 109, "textEnd": 121}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

ASK rediffGURUS!\n\nHigh-cost borrowing\n\nCredit card borrowings come at a high cost.\n\n\"Always spend the money you have. If you don't pay back your card dues on time, you could be charged an interest rate that could go up to 40 per cent or above on your due amount,\" says Sumanta Mandal, TechnoFino founder.\n\n\"Credit cards carry the highest rate among all credit products. Always use your credit card as you would a debit card,\" Mandal adds.\n\nSpend wisely\n\nControl your spending to avoid falling into a debt spiral.\n\n\"Lack of self-control over spending leads to a credit card debt trap. People think they have money and spend using a credit card, but when it's time to pay, they realise they don't have the money,\" says Mandal.\n\nTo escape a debt trap, do not increase your existing debt.\n\n\"Don't make new purchases using your card until you have paid off your outstanding debt. If you have multiple credit cards, prioritise your debts and pay off the ones attracting the highest interest,\" says Shetty.\n\nAvoid paying minimum dues\n\nIf you tend to make minimum due payments, curb this habit. The interest will continue to accrue on the outstanding balance, adding to your debt.\n\n\"Settling the minimum payment each month might feel good, but it could be a costly mistake,\" says Satish Mehta, founder of Athena CredXpert.\n\n\"Most of your payment will probably be used to cover interest charges, and the principal amount will only be partially reduced. You will end up accruing higher interest overall,\" explains Mehta.\n\nIf crisis looms\n\nIf you are already facing a payment crisis, stop using your credit cards.\n\n\"Stop taking any new debt. The aim is to get out of the debt trap, so accumulating more debt can be highly counterproductive,\" says Mehta.\n\nWhile personal loans are also costly, they are significantly cheaper (10.5 to 20.6 per cent) than credit card dues.\n\n\"Take a personal loan to clear your card dues. Also, consider borrowing from family and paying dues,\" says Mandal.\n\nConsider juggling your dues between cards.\n\n\"If you are using a high-interest credit card, explore balance transfer options to transfer your dues to a lower-interest card.\n\n\"You may also convert your existing outstanding credit card balance into affordable monthly EMIs (equated monthly instalments). However, a processing fee may apply. Alternatively, you can negotiate with your issuer to reduce the fees,\" says Shetty.\n\nIf your card dues are high, take a loan against gold or fixed deposits (which are cheaper than personal loans) to pay off this loan.\n\nBeware of consequences\n\nFailing to pay on time hurts your credit score.\n\n\"A default will result in a low credit score,\" says Mehta.\n\n\"You will face difficulties in availing a new loan because the lender will consider you a risky customer.\"\n\nQUESTIONS ABOUT MONEY?

{"uri": "8219007066", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-07-10", "time": "15:46:42", "dateTime": "2024-07-10T15:46:42Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-07-10T15:46:26Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "url": "https://rollingout.com/2024/07/10/5-financial-consequences-of-card-debt/", "title": "5 negative financial consequences of carrying credit card debt", "body": "Credit card debt can be a burden and impact your prospects for prosperity\n\nCarrying credit card debt can significantly impact your financial health in numerous ways. While credit cards offer convenience and the ability to build credit, mismanaging them can lead to detrimental outcomes. Here, we explore five negative financial consequences of carrying credit card debt and provide some strategies to mitigate these impacts.\n\nOne of the most immediate and severe consequences of carrying credit card debt is the high-interest payments. Credit cards often come with interest rates that are substantially higher than other types of loans. When you carry a balance, the interest compounds, meaning you are charged interest on the interest from previous months. This can quickly snowball, causing your debt to grow exponentially.\n\nCompounding interest is a silent financial drain. For example, if you have a credit card with an 18% annual percentage rate (APR) and you carry a balance of $5,000, you could end up paying nearly $900 in interest over a year if you make only the minimum payments. This is money that could otherwise be used for savings or other essential expenses.\n\nTo combat high-interest payments, consider transferring your balance to a card with a lower APR or a 0% introductory rate. Additionally, prioritize paying off high-interest debt first and making more than the minimum payment each month to reduce the principal balance faster.\n\nAnother significant consequence of carrying credit card debt is the potential damage to your credit score. Your credit utilization ratio, which is the amount of credit you are using compared to your credit limit, is a crucial factor in determining your credit score. A high utilization ratio can negatively impact your score, making it more challenging to secure loans or obtain favorable interest rates.\n\nA high credit utilization ratio suggests to lenders that you may be over-reliant on credit, which can be a red flag. For instance, if your total credit limit is $10,000 and you consistently carry a balance of $7,000, your utilization ratio is 70%, which is well above the recommended 30%.\n\nTo improve your credit score, aim to keep your credit utilization below 30%. Paying down existing balances and requesting a higher credit limit (without increasing your spending) can help lower your utilization ratio. Regularly monitoring your credit report for errors and ensuring timely payments also contribute to a healthier credit score.\n\nCarrying substantial credit card debt can significantly limit your financial flexibility. High monthly payments can strain your budget, leaving little room for savings, investments, or unexpected expenses. This lack of flexibility can make it challenging to achieve long-term financial goals such as buying a home, starting a business, or saving for retirement.\n\nRelying on minimum payments can extend the time you are in debt for many years. For example, if you have a $10,000 balance with a 15% APR and make only the minimum payment of 2% of the balance each month, it could take over 30 years to pay off the debt, and you could end up paying more in interest than the original balance.\n\nTo enhance financial flexibility, create a budget that prioritizes debt repayment and reduces unnecessary expenses. Establish an emergency fund to cover unexpected costs without resorting to credit cards, and consider seeking advice from a financial advisor to develop a comprehensive debt repayment strategy.\n\nThe psychological impact of carrying credit card debt should not be underestimated. Financial stress can lead to anxiety, depression, and a range of other mental health issues. The constant worry about making payments and the fear of falling deeper into debt can take a significant toll on your well-being.\n\nStudies have shown a strong correlation between financial debt and mental health problems. Individuals with significant debt are more likely to experience stress-related illnesses, reduced productivity, and strained relationships.\n\nManaging financial stress involves both practical and emotional strategies. On the practical side, developing a clear debt repayment plan can provide a sense of control. On the emotional side, seeking support from friends, family, or a mental health professional can help alleviate the stress associated with debt.\n\nFinally, carrying credit card debt represents a significant opportunity cost in terms of lost investments. The money spent on interest payments and debt repayment is money that could have been invested in assets that generate returns, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate.\n\nConsider the long-term impact of not investing. For example, if you spend $500 per month on credit card payments, that is $6,000 per year that could have been invested. Over 20 years, with an average return of 7%, this could grow to more than $250,000. Carrying debt, therefore, not only affects your present financial situation but also hampers your future financial growth.\n\nTo redirect funds towards investments, focus on paying off high-interest debt as quickly as possible. Once the debt is manageable or eliminated, start diverting the funds you used for debt repayment into investment accounts. This shift can help you build wealth over time and secure a more stable financial future.\n\nCarrying credit card debt has far-reaching consequences that extend beyond the immediate financial burden. High-interest payments, damage to your credit score, limited financial flexibility, increased stress, and the opportunity cost of lost investments are significant drawbacks that can affect your financial health and overall well-being. By understanding these consequences and implementing strategies to manage and reduce debt, you can take control of your financial future and work towards achieving greater financial stability and peace of mind.

Ever since they started developing the area, I always said that I would like to own a property there. I love the community and it's close to the M1, making it easily accessible to London, which was a huge selling point for me.\"\n\nIn order to secure the property, Fiona had to provide documents in order to get a mortgage. Usually, people have to show their ID, proof of address and bank statements.\n\nShe didn't think this would be an issue after previously having an impressive credit score, but she was left speechless when her provider, Leeds Building Society, told her it wasn't that great after all.\n\nFiona checks her credit score roughly every two months and makes sure to pay off all her debts straight away to keep on top of it.\n\nHowever, when applying for the mortgage, her latest credit score check showed activity that was carried out by her twin sister was included on her report.\n\nShe added: \"I've always been a regular checker of my credit score. I have credit cards, use Klarna for shopping, and have some rewards cards, so it's important for me to keep track of my score.\n\n\"Earlier this year, I was applying for a mortgage, and my mortgage broker recommended that I check my credit score. Thank goodness I did, because I was able to see that my report included transactions and activity made by my twin, not me.\n\n\"Apparently, this is not uncommon, particularly in cases like mine and my sister's, because our initials, surnames, addresses and dates of birth are identical.\"\n\nAs her sister's credit score was not as good as hers, Fiona nearly missed out on the house she had her heart set on.\n\nShe added: \"It was a stressful time. I couldn't start the mortgage process until I got this sorted, which jeopardised my chance of getting the property.\n\n\"I had to put everything on hold and didn't know when it would be resolved. The property was in the area I had decided I really wanted to live in, and it was the only one left. There was a lot at stake, and I really thought I was going to lose it.\"\n\nIt took several weeks for the issue to be resolved.\n\nThis was difficult for Fiona, but she said that \"resilience\" and \"motivation\" kept her going.\n\nOnce the issue was identified, she was able to work through the discrepancies with her broker and remove the errors from her report. Her mortgage was then approved, luckily.\n\nUnder Section 159 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, any wrong entry on your credit file must be amended or removed within 28 days of the agency or lender being notified.\n\nShe added: \"I do wonder how much time and money I would have wasted if I'd not fixed the twin problem. It could have cost me my ideal home in the location I really wanted.\"\n\nFiona said that she also turned to Facebook groups for tips on what to do, and said that she still returns to them when she's looking for advice on how to manage credit reports and hit the highest score she can.\n\nAccording to consumer group Which?, it's worth checking your credit report at least once a month to make sure the information it contains is correct and up to date.\n\nIts website advises: \"If you notice any mistakes, it's important to get them rectified as soon as possible to ensure they aren't dragging down your credit score unnecessarily and won't have any adverse effect on future credit applications.\n\n\"You can do this by contacting the company that provided the incorrect information or the credit reference agency itself, which will investigate on your behalf.\n\n\"Note that it's also a good idea to make sure all of your accounts, whether you use them or not, have your correct details. Inconsistencies in addresses between accounts, for instance, can result in you failing application ID checks.\"", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_braeger@inews.co.uk", "name": "Emily Braeger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_bureau", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit bureau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_motorway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M1 motorway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Keynes", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milton Keynes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milton Keynes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_broker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage broker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Building society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Credit_Act_1974", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer Credit Act 1974"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Which?", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Which?"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Credit_and_Collection", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Credit and Collection", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Mortgages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Mortgages", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fiona.jpg?crop=0px%2C664px%2C1242px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720733", "eventUri": "eng-9720733", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

These trends represent a growth of around 20 percent in both overall volume and penetration rate in 2023, it said.\n\nAdditional data from the Credit Card Association of the Philippines (CCAP) was consistent with the trends observed by TransUnion.\n\nIts data showed credit card spending increased by 39 percent to P853 billion in the first half of 2023 - a jump from the 29 percent increase in the previous year. The trends in card originations, total volume, penetration and spending all indicate a promising growth trajectory for the credit card market in the country.\n\nA deeper dive into the TransUnion insights showed that Gen Z Filipinos are emerging as significant contributors to the increase in credit card originations.\n\nThe percentage share of overall originations among Gen Z Filipinos has more than doubled over the past five years from just under one in ten (9 percent) in the third quarter of 2019 to more than one in five (22 percent) in the third quarter of 2023. The share will likely increase as more Gen Z consumers reach adulthood, it said.\n\nGen Z Filipinos also comprised a greater share of the new-to-card segment of borrowers - they made up one-third (33 percent) of all new-to-card borrowers in 2023. New-to-card borrowers are those originating their first ever credit card on file according to TransUnion Philippines' data.\n\nData from TransUnion's first-quarter 2024 Philippines Consumer Pulse Study gave additional insights into factors positively affecting active credit participation among younger Filipinos.\n\nAccording to the study, almost all surveyed Gen Z Filipinos (98 percent) see access to credit and lending products as important to achieving their financial goals.\n\nThey were also found to be some of the most frequent credit monitors in the country, consistently keeping an eye on their credit status to find the best credit offers accessible to them.\n\n\"The credit card market in the Philippines will continue to experience growth as demand remains high, especially amongst younger consumers. Data from TransUnion clearly shows that the younger generation of Filipinos, particularly Gen Z, are quickly emerging as a cornerstone for future market growth.

Similarly, having no credit history can cause problems because lenders don't have enough information to judge whether you'll pay back your loan.\n\nA secured credit card can help you build or rebuild your credit score. The money is secured with a deposit that's typically refundable when you meet certain requirements, and your credit limit usually equals your upfront deposit.\n\nIn terms of the best secured credit cards on the market, the Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card stands out. With no annual fee and an ongoing cash back rewards structure, it offers more features than other secured cards. Here's a closer look at the Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card to help you decide if it's worth adding to your wallet.\n\nBefore taking out a credit card, you want to ensure it's the right fit for your situation. Here are a few scenarios where the Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card is worth it:\n\nNo credit score is required when you apply for the Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card. That makes the card a good option for borrowers with minimal credit history or anyone looking to improve their credit score. Discover reports your payment history to the three major credit bureaus -- Experian, Equifax and TransUnion -- which will reflect positively on your credit report if you practice responsible credit card usage such as paying on time each month and keeping your balance low.\n\nKeep in mind, however, Discover also reports payment delinquencies, which will hurt your credit score, so make sure you stay on top of your payments.\n\nThe Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card doesn't come with an annual fee, but you will have to pay an upfront security deposit of $200 to $2,500 to \"secure\" the card. The amount you deposit will equal your initial credit limit, so you'll have to put down more money if you want a higher credit limit. Discover automatically reviews your account after seven months of responsible use to see if you can transition to an unsecured credit card. If this happens, Discover will return your deposit.\n\nUnlike most secured credit cards, the Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card comes with an ongoing cash back rewards structure. You'll earn:\n\nEven better, Discover offers a unique welcome bonus to new cardholders in the form of its Cashback Match program: At the end of your first year of card ownership, Discover matches all your cash back earnings. That means if you earn $100 in cash back for the year, the issuer will award you an additional $100.\n\nAfter you've been a cardholder for seven months, Discover automatically reviews your account monthly to see if you're ready to graduate to an unsecured credit card. If you do graduate, you'll get to keep your same account, avoiding another hard credit inquiry to your credit report.\n\nThe Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card is a good choice for many no- or low-credit borrowers, but it won't be right for everyone. Here are a few situations where the card may not be worth it:\n\nIf you already have a good credit score, the Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card isn't worth applying for. The card comes with a higher-than-average 28.24 percent ongoing variable APR, and you can get a higher credit limit and better rewards by choosing another option, such as the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back.\n\nIf you can't manage to make your monthly payments on time, a secured credit card is not going to help you. Because Discover reports your payments to the credit bureaus, late payments could further drag down your score. If you still decide that a secured credit card is right for you, consider using autopay to help stay on top of future bills.\n\nWhen you open the Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card, your credit limit equals your initial deposit. The minimum amount you can deposit is $200, which could be a financial burden.\n\nIf you can't afford the upfront deposit, look into another card that requires a lesser security deposit. For example, the Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card offers a $200 initial line of credit for a $49, $99 or $200 deposit depending on your creditworthiness.\n\nYou must fund your Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card with a bank account, so it isn't an option for borrowers without banking access. If you don't have a bank account, you may be better off looking into cards that allow alternative payment methods -- though watch for even higher fees.\n\nIf this is a challenge you're facing, see our guide to getting a secured credit card with no bank account.\n\nIf you're looking for an opportunity to build or rebuild your credit score, the Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card can help you do just that -- and while earning cash back rewards to boot. Just make sure you can afford the upfront deposit and commit to making your monthly payments on time.\n\nThe Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card can help you build credit while also earning a modest amount of cash back -- just remember to focus on responsible credit usage over racking up rewards. You'll also need a minimum security deposit of $200 in order to get the card.\n\nIf you're not sure whether this is the right card for you, check out our list of the best secured credit cards to compare your options.

In this guide, we'll delve into the ins and outs of revolving credit lines, exploring their benefits and potential pitfalls to help you make informed decisions about your financial future.\n\nUnderstanding Revolving Credit Lines\n\nRevolving credit is a flexible form of credit that allows borrowers to access funds up to a predetermined credit limit. Unlike traditional loans, where you receive a lump sum upfront and make fixed monthly payments, revolving credit lines offer ongoing access to funds as you need them. As you repay the borrowed amount, the available credit replenishes, providing a revolving source of funds for various expenses.\n\nExploring the Mechanics of Revolving Credit\n\nThe mechanics of revolving credit are relatively straightforward. Once approved for a revolving credit line, you can borrow funds up to the established credit limit. You have the flexibility to use as much or as little of the available credit as needed, and you can repay the borrowed amount at your own pace. Each payment you make reduces the outstanding balance, making more credit available for future use.\n\nThe Benefits of Revolving Credit\n\nOne of the primary benefits of revolving credit lines is their flexibility. Unlike traditional loans with fixed repayment schedules, revolving credit lines allow borrowers to adapt to changing financial needs. Whether you're facing unexpected expenses or pursuing opportunities for growth, having access to a revolving credit line can provide peace of mind and financial flexibility.\n\nThe Drawbacks of Revolving Credit\n\nWhile revolving credit lines offer flexibility, they also come with potential drawbacks. One of the most significant concerns is the temptation to overspend. With ongoing access to credit, some borrowers may find themselves accumulating high levels of debt without a clear plan for repayment. Additionally, revolving credit lines often carry higher interest rates than traditional loans, leading to increased borrowing costs over time.\n\nNavigating Revolving Credit Wisely\n\nTo make the most of revolving credit lines while minimizing the risks, it's essential to approach them with caution and discipline. Start by evaluating your financial needs and borrowing only what you can afford to repay. Create a budget to track your spending and ensure that you're using credit responsibly. Consider setting limits on your credit usage to prevent excessive debt accumulation.\n\nConsidering Alternative Financing Options\n\nWhile revolving credit lines can be a valuable financial tool, they're not the only option available. Personal loans online offer another avenue for accessing funds without the revolving credit structure. With fixed repayment terms and predictable monthly payments, personal loans provide simplicity and clarity for borrowers seeking stability in their financial arrangements.\n\nSeeking Professional Advice\n\nIf you're unsure whether revolving credit lines are the right choice for your financial situation, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor.

TransUnion partly attributed this performance to value-added services being offered by credit card providers such as reward points, installment payment facilities and discounts associated with cards.\n\n\"While it's an important factor for potential growth opportunities among lenders, bringing new-to-card consumers into the formal financial system can also drive greater financial inclusion by catering to a larger demographic of borrowers,\" Sun said. -- IAN NICOLAS P.

The next step will be internationalization.\n\nDS Intermedi\u00e1rios de Cr\u00e9dito recorded 350 million euros of written credit in the first quarter of the year, representing a 60% increase in turnover. Last year as a whole, it increased by 30% to 1,065 million euros of written credit. In an interview with Jornal Econ\u00f3mico, Marta Almeida, director and national coordinator of DS Intermedi\u00e1rios de Cr\u00e9dito, the brand of Grupo Decis\u00f5es e Solu\u00e7\u00f5es specialized in providing credit advisory and intermediation services, aims to reach three billion euros of intermediation credit, within two or three years, representing about 30% of the credit intermediation market. Then it wants to cross borders. \"We want to continue growing in the country and take the next step towards internationalizing the brand,\" she says.\n\nHow has the credit brokerage business evolved in Portugal?\n\nThe activity of credit intermediation has gained increasing importance in recent years, especially in recent years, due to the economic and financial situation of the country, which directly affects household income. In these more challenging contexts, there is naturally a greater demand for personal and consumer credit as well as for real estate credit. For these operations, there has been a growing demand for the services of credit intermediaries, who provide support in terms of advice to individuals and families, in order to help them obtain the best conditions for their new loans, or to renegotiate loans already existing.\n\nToday, credit brokers are considered true partners of banking agencies. For example, according to data from the National Association of Certified Credit Brokers [ANICA]Credit brokers are responsible for selling between 70% and 90% of housing loans from the main banks in Portugal.\n\nIn the same sense, credit intermediation has become more regulated - an example of this is the legal regime that regulates the activity of credit intermediaries, supervised by the Bank of Portugal, which came into force at the beginning of 2018 - but we believe that as they gain greater importance in the financial and banking sector, it is necessary to continue this legislative process. It is a way to avoid stagnation in the profession, allowing credit intermediation professionals to continue following the standards implemented by the Bank of Portugal and the evolution and dignity of this sector.\n\nDid you benefit from the cancellation of investment in bank branches?\n\nToday we know that the future of credit granting will involve credit brokers who have a set of tools that differentiate them from direct contact with the banking entity, not to mention the possibility of integrating these tools with different banks. But we believe that credit brokers are first and foremost true partners of banks. Just take a look at the data shared by ANICA.\n\nOn the other hand, for banks, this is a way to win more business, as these professionals are very focused on the business, which represents a controlled investment, recoverable in a short period of time - and also a way to reduce fixed costs, with employees and sales outlets.\n\nFurthermore, the credit intermediary also plays a very important educational role, specifically in promoting financial literacy, in partnership with other entities, i.e. schools, financial entities, etc. In this context, DS Intermedi\u00e1rios de Cr\u00e9dito created, in 2022, the Children's Financial Literacy Project \"Os Mini-Her\u00f3is da Poupan\u00e7a\", through which it works to promote financial literacy for children in several schools in the country. Through this project, we have already held dozens of events, which have reached thousands of students and the educational community in several schools throughout the country.\n\nHow did DS evolve?\n\nDS Intermedi\u00e1rios de Cr\u00e9dito was launched in 2017 with the clear objective of, on the one hand, supporting the population, providing advice and support to individual clients and families, to find the best financing solutions or negotiate the conditions they can obtain, both in real estate credit and consumer credit, and on the other hand, being another project of Geupo DS with job opportunities.\n\nOver the last seven years, we have focused on offering a distinctive, close and personal service, which has allowed us to grow from year to year, strengthening our presence in the market and being currently a reference in credit brokerage in Portugal, with a very great experience of the partners involved in the financial and banking sector.\n\nIn the first three months of this year, we reached a total of around EUR 350 million of written credit, representing a turnover growth of 60% compared to the same period last year. During this period, we signed 10 new contracts to open stores and opened 10 new units in the country. In total, we now have around 170 stores nationwide, including open units and those in the process of opening.\n\nAt the same time, DS Intermedi\u00e1rios de Cr\u00e9dito is also an opportunity for future employees who want to join us and develop on a personal and professional level. Today, we have a team of 1,400 employees nationwide, results that demonstrate the clear expansion of the brand and the focus we maintain on continuing to grow and offer the best possible service, as well as the clear preference of the people who have joined us, because they see our brand as a reference in the sector.\n\nIs the housing crisis and the measures that have been proposed an opportunity for activity?\n\nThe measures announced by the government are welcome and will undoubtedly be an exceptional support, however we believe that there is still a way to go before it is possible to change the model between real estate supply and demand, especially in the large urban centres, where demand has been greater.\n\nThe supply shortage will not be resolved immediately, so demand will remain, leading to a continuous rise in property prices in Portugal.\n\nTo give you an idea, in the first quarter of this year alone, DS Intermedi\u00e1rios de Cr\u00e9dito registered more than 50% more new housing loans compared to the same period last year. As for housing credit transfers, they increased by 48% compared to the same period last year.\n\nOn the one hand, in the current context, there are more Portuguese who want to renegotiate their loans so that they can cover their expenses, and on the other hand, there is still a great demand for housing loans.\n\nIn this scenario, challenges still exist, and credit brokers play a crucial role in providing advice on obtaining housing loans, or renegotiating existing credits, helping participants in this process make informed decisions that allow for the greatest possible savings adjusted to your needs.\n\nWhat are your views on the development of the activity?\n\nThe credit broker plays a fundamental role in Portuguese society, contributing through this concrete responsibility to economic growth, business development and the realization of personal projects, in addition to the increasing responsibility of credit brokers in promoting the financial culture of consumers.\n\nThere is a need for greater definition in the profession. It is important that Banco de Portugal defines, more specifically, some rules, with training being one of the priorities. At the same time, it will be necessary for credit brokers to invest in their training on an ongoing basis, to be properly informed of all the rules implemented by the entities that regulate credit brokerage, and to monitor the evolution of the activity, thus providing the best service to clients.\n\nWe believe that this activity will continue to evolve, which is why at DS Intermedi\u00e1rios de Cr\u00e9dito we will continue to invest heavily in the training of those who join us, technically and commercially, but also behaviorally, in skills such as leadership and personal development. In parallel, we will continue to develop the area of financial literacy, which we consider to be of great importance and to which credit intermediaries can contribute significantly.\n\nWhat are DS's goals for this year and next?\n\nIn the next two or three years, we want to reach three billion euros of intermediary credit. Capturing around 30% of the country's credit intermediation market is also a goal. This means that we will help more people and families to have the best conditions for their credit, and as much savings as possible, adjusted to their needs.\n\nWe believe these are achievable goals, as we have excellent professionals in our teams, continue to recruit and expand the network, and as DS Group, we will create a unified structure with over 20 years of experience in the market.\n\nAs has been the case until now, we want to continue growing in the country and take the next step towards internationalizing the brand. At the moment, we have the ambition to reach 200 stores in Portugal by the end of the year. We will continue to build on our history with a clear mission to support the community.", "source": {"uri": "brytfmonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "brytfmonline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrea_hargraves@brytfmonline.com", "name": "Andrea Hargraves", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Broker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_de_Portugal", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Banco de Portugal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_literacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial literacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almeida,_Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Almeida, Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Almeida, Portugal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_cost", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fixed cost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Literacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply and demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Education and Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://jornaleconomico.sapo.pt/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Marta-Almeida-DS-e1720569494566.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720733", "eventUri": "eng-9720733", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

While it doesn't offer the same benefits as traditional credit cards, your activity is (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion), increasing your credit score as you improve your credit habits.\n\nThere's a variable 35.90% purchase APR and cash advance APR. This is on the high end for APRs, even for credit-builder cards.\n\nFor your first year, your annual fee can range from $75 to $125, then $99 to $125 after that, depending on your credit limit:\n\nReflex Mastercard doesn't have an introductory offer or rewards.\n\nThe Reflex Mastercard is ideal for those who need to build or rebuild their credit and are having difficulty qualifying for a traditional credit card. And because it reports to the three major credit bureaus, when you're ready to make the jump to a traditional credit card, you can show potential lenders you're creditworthy with a solid track record of making on-time payments.\n\nWhen you're initially approved for the Reflex Mastercard, you'll have a credit limit between $300 to $1,500. Your initial credit limit will double after making your first six monthly minimum payments on time.\n\nBumping up your credit limit means you could increase how often you use your card. As long as you continue to at least make minimum payments each month, lenders will see your creditworthiness, increasing your chances of being approved for a traditional credit card in the future.\n\nReflex Mastercard reports to the major credit bureaus, which helps show future potential lenders that you're building up responsible credit use. Remember that it's not just your on-time payment history that's reported; if you miss or fall behind on payments, that's also reported to the credit bureaus.\n\nWith Reflex Mastercard, you can see if you're eligible without triggering a hard credit check.\n\nThe annual fee is upwards of $125, which is high for cards without benefits or rewards.\n\nSome credit-building cards charge annual fees to those with less-than-stellar credit because they're taking a risk lending to you. But that fee, along with a monthly maintenance fee (up to $10 a month), an additional card fee ($30, if applicable), late payment, and returned payment fees ($41 each) can add up. There are plenty of other cards available that don't come with all of these extra charges.\n\nEven credit-builder cards can offer welcome bonuses or rewards to entice new customers. The Reflex Mastercard doesn't have any perks for usage. Aside from reporting to the three major credit bureaus, you don't get much out of this card compared to similar credit-builder cards on the market right now.\n\nThe Reflex Mastercard's APR is on the high end for credit cards. That means if you can't pay off your credit card and carry the balance into the next month, you could face an additional charge along with the laundry list of fees you already have.\n\nThe lower your APR, the less you pay in interest when you carry a balance. The higher your APR, the more you'll pay in interest on top of your principal balance. This could make it hard to stay up-to-date on payments if you're struggling to make the minimum monthly payment every month.\n\nYou can use the Reflex Mastercard wherever Mastercard is accepted.\n\nYou can log into your account both online or to check your statements, make payments, and view recent transactions. Once there, you can see your due date, schedule an auto payment, or make a one-time payment on your card.\n\nContinental Finance is the servicer for the Reflex Mastercard servicer. You can log into your account any time of the day, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nYou can call customer service at 1-866-449-4514. Customer care representatives are available Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to midnight, and Saturday and Sunday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET. You can also contact them via mail at:\n\nBefore you sign up for the Reflex Mastercard, there are a few other alternatives to consider. Compare the Reflex Mastercard to these and other cards on the market to see which one is best for you.\n\nThis article was edited by Rebecca McCracken", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

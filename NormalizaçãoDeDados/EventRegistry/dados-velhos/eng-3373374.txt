He said that it was the establishment mentality that had done everything.\n\nHe said the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was just a pawn used for ousting Nawaz Sharif. Speaking to a private TV channel, Pervaiz Rashid said that he had rendered a sacrifice in the DawnLeaks episode for democracy and against terrorism. \"Won't take the name of the institution but certain individuals were involved in conspiring against us,\" he said.\n\n\"There is a ghost, which I call the ghost of Musharraf's legacy, it is present in political parties, political minds, and the institutions of the country. \"We have to change this thinking, we have to challenge it and fight against it,\" said the former information minister.\n\nHe said that Musharraf had not been sent abroad at the government's behest but it could not stop him either. \"Other institutions did not help us in stopping Musharraf,\" he said. \"A lot of decisions are taken collectively.\"\n\nPervaiz Rashid said that earlier, prime ministers used to go home silently. He stated that now that would not be the case. Rasheed further said that despite having the interior ministry, a Joint Investigation Team was formed and Whatsapp messages were sent.\n\n\"Decisions were taken against us despite the presence of the interior ministry,\" he said. \"A lot happened despite the existence of our government,\" he added. This is the first time that Pervaiz Rashid has shed light on the Leaks saga after he was sacked by the former prime minister after a probe was initiated into the controversy.\n\nWhen asked to comment on the fact that he was sacked by the then prime minister Nawaz Sharif, Rashid said that he would speak on the issue on another day. \"We can talk about this on another day. This is not a big issue,\" he said. \"I am a political worker and have played that role in the past as well. A lot of truth comes out in open with the passage of time,\" he said.\n\nSenator Pervaiz Rasheed said that he resigned during the Leaks controversy to save democracy in the country. He added that he gave the sacrifice for strengthening democracy in the country. He added that in the past, people would forget the name of a prime minister in two months after his ouster, but this time the people of Pakistan reacted to Nawaz being ousted.\n\nMeanwhile, reacting to the remarks of Pervaiz Rashid, spokesman for former interior minister Ch Nisar Ali Khan said that some people had put the whole burden of their mistakes on interior ministry and establishment.\n\nHe said that such people were harping on about the interior ministry. He said that he must have the courage to openly explain about the conspiracy against the Nawaz government and should have moral courage. He said that riddles should not be put to nation for their solution.\n\nHe said if they were innocent, they should recommend the government to make the Leaks report public. He said that the members of the committee which gave decision against them were under federal and provincial governments.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T00:43:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8352941274642944, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373374", "time": "00:43:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373374", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "48650", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "303023", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Government"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government", "score": 5}, {"id": "303057", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "score": 3}, {"id": "303494", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Interior ministry"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_ministry", "score": 5}, {"id": "303921", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "score": 4}, {"id": "305931", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pakistanis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_people", "score": 2}, {"id": "306307", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "score": 2}, {"id": "307776", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Nawaz Sharif"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawaz_Sharif", "score": 4}, {"id": "307782", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Nisar Ali Khan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisar_Ali_Khan", "score": 2}, {"id": "335568", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf", "score": 3}, {"id": "338006", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "score": 4}, {"id": "374248", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Pervez Musharraf"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pervez_Musharraf", "score": 3}, {"id": "376729", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Muslim League (N)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Muslim_League_(N)", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 4}, {"id": "1318642", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "First Sharif ministry"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sharif_ministry", "score": 1}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "00:43:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Pervaiz Rashid points the finger at own interior ministry", "originalArticle": null}

The news accompanied media reports that PML-N leader and Chief Minister Punjab Shahbaz Sharif had appealed to other party leaders to desist from attacking state institutions in their speeches and avoid any confrontation with organs of the state.\n\nWhile it is not clear what Nisar's press conference will be about, senior Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz politician Pervaiz Rashid's criticism of the former interior minister on Friday had caused the latter to hit back, saying he did not know why \"some people have put the burden of all their mistakes and blunders on the ministry of interior and the establishment\".\n\nIn a TV interview, the first salvo was fired by Rashid who sounded upset with Nisar on what the Interior Ministry could and could not have done during Nawaz Sharif's third term as prime minister.\n\nWithout providing any details, he spoke of decisions taken by the ministry headed by Nisar that went against the PML-N. Nisar responded within no time and issued a statement through his spokesperson, saying Rashid should have explained as to what kind of help he expected from the ministry to \"cover up their deeds\".\n\nHe also advised Rashid to ask \"his government\" to make public the news leak report - which led to Rashid's ouster from office as information minister - to prove his innocence. The PML-N has been upping the ante in its rhetoric surrounding Nawaz Sharif's ouster by the Supreme Court, framing the decision as part of a long-running conspiracy against democracy perpetrated by the 'usual suspects'.\n\nThe party's criticism of the legacy of dictatorships as the root cause behind Nawaz's ouster has sometimes blurred the distinction between past dictators and the people heading state institutions.\n\nFor example, during his 'homecoming' rally from Islamabad to Lahore, Nawaz had accused the judiciary of being complicit in the military's toppling of his preceding government while challenging it to hold dictators accountable the way, he said, civilian rulers are taken to task.\n\nIn a later interview, he also said he alone could not be held responsible for creating friction between state institutions.\n\nSome party stalwarts, including Nisar and Shahbaz, have previously warned against such posturing, with the former interior minister saying at one point that there is too much at stake for Nawaz to create a situation that might result in conflict between institutions.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T01:02:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7882353067398071, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373374", "time": "01:02:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373374", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "48501", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "48650", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302954", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Politician"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "score": 3}, {"id": "305403", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "score": 2}, {"id": "307776", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Nawaz Sharif"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawaz_Sharif", "score": 3}, {"id": "307782", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Nisar Ali Khan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisar_Ali_Khan", "score": 4}, {"id": "309434", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_Pakistan", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 5}, {"id": "323139", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "News leak"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_leak", "score": 2}, {"id": "376729", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Muslim League (N)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Muslim_League_(N)", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 5}, {"id": "388472", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shahbaz Sharif"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahbaz_Sharif", "score": 5}, {"id": "1272099", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of Chief Ministers of Punjab (Pakistan)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chief_Ministers_of_Punjab_(Pakistan)", "score": 4}], "image": "http://dailytimes.com.pk/static/uploads/original/d435e7207a7ba587dfdcd155bbbe06c6.jpg ", "timeCrawl": "01:02:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "  Shehbaz, Nisar talk over phone    ", "originalArticle": null}

The announcement also came hours after Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif reportedly asked party leaders to refrain from attacking state institutions in their speeches.\n\nThough the spokesperson did not specify what issues the former minister would speak on, political observers and PML-N leaders believe that the politician from Chakri will respond to the criticism from Pervaiz Rashid.\n\nAddressing a news conference days before the announcement of the Panama Papers verdict, the former minister had confirmed, for the first time, reports about an internal rift within the party, claiming he had been excluded from the consultative process on Panamagate.\n\nIn a TV interview on Friday, the former information minister had said that the interior ministry, headed by Chaudhry Nisar, had made certain decisions that went against the PML-N and its government.\n\nMercurial ex-minister incensed by former cabinet colleague's remarks\n\nMr Rashid, who was sacked in the wake of the controversy surrounding a Dawn story about a high-level security meeting held last year, had complained that \"other institutions\" didn't help the PML-N in stopping former dictator retired Gen Pervez Musharraf from leaving the country.\n\nBut within no time, Chaudhry Nisar responded through his spokesperson, saying that Mr Rashid should have explained what kind of help he expected from the interior ministry to \"cover up their deeds\".\n\nReferring to the report of an inquiry committee in the news leak controversy, the statement said that only one member of the six-man committee was from the interior ministry, adding that the remaining members were \"subordinates\" of either federal or provincial departments.\n\nNisar's remarks -- advising Mr Rashid to ask \"his government\" to release the inquiry report that can exonerate him -- clearly show that the former minister does not want to associate himself with the government of Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi.\n\nThe statements also lend credence to reports that Chaudhry Nisar had differed with the government's strategy with regards to Gen Musharraf's trial and the news leak controversy.\n\nThe former minister has publicly opposed the party's strategy in the Panama Papers issue, and became upset when his advice to not censure the Supreme Court-appointed Joint Investigation Team (JIT) and the other institutions was ignored by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.\n\nHowever, party sources said the leadership was unhappy with Chaudhry Nisar for his inaction as the interior minister -- first during the formation of the inquiry committee on the news leaks issue, then with the constitution of the JIT, which was headed by a senior official of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), which reports directly to the interior ministry.\n\nIn private, Chaudhry Nisar has reportedly said that he was blamed for not helping the government with both issues, even though both bodies contained representatives of institutions that fell under the control of other ministries.\n\nIn background discussions, senior PML-N leaders revealed that differences between Chaudhry Nisar and the party's leadership first emerged in July 2014, when Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan announced plans to stage a sit-in against alleged rigging in the 2013 general elections.\n\nSources said an anti-Nisar group within the party believed that he had either mishandled the sit-in, or had covertly supported the marchers by allowing them to enter the high-security Red Zone, where protesters remained camped out for 126 days.\n\nChaudhry Nisar was also opposed to Mr Sharif's plan to travel to Lahore via GT Road. He did not welcome Mr Sharif's rally when it passed through his constituency. Referring to the media reports about his absence from the Sharif's rally, Chaudhry Nisar had expressed annoyance, saying as to why only he was being discussed when 90 per cent of the PML-N's senior leadership had skipped the rally.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:16:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 3994, "textStart": 3985, "date": "2014-07-", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7882353067398071, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373374", "time": "03:16:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373374", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "48650", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302954", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Politician"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "score": 3}, {"id": "307776", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Nawaz Sharif"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawaz_Sharif", "score": 2}, {"id": "307782", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Nisar Ali Khan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisar_Ali_Khan", "score": 4}, {"id": "307910", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9d\u00e9ration_Internationale_de_l'Automobile", "score": 2}, {"id": "309434", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_Pakistan", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 5}, {"id": "323139", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "News leak"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_leak", "score": 3}, {"id": "325537", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Imran Khan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan", "score": 1}, {"id": "335568", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf", "score": 2}, {"id": "345914", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sit-in"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sit-in", "score": 2}, {"id": "357423", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shahid Khaqan Abbasi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi", "score": 2}, {"id": "374248", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Pervez Musharraf"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pervez_Musharraf", "score": 3}, {"id": "376729", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Muslim League (N)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Muslim_League_(N)", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 5}, {"id": "381084", "label": {"eng": "Federal Investigation Agency"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Investigation_Agency", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 2}, {"id": "388472", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shahbaz Sharif"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahbaz_Sharif", "score": 3}, {"id": "1243748", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Panama Papers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers", "score": 3}, {"id": "1272099", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of Chief Ministers of Punjab (Pakistan)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chief_Ministers_of_Punjab_(Pakistan)", "score": 3}], "image": "http://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/08/5998fdd47778b.jpg", "timeCrawl": "03:16:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Nisar set to expose PML-N 'infighting'", "originalArticle": null}

Look at the immediate reaction of people (to the ouster), he remarked, as opposed to the past where silence would greet a prime minister's dismissal.\n\nThis was, however, somewhat of a rare positive that Mr Rashid could put his finger on in his talk. Overall, his rather abrupt sum-up of the situation after a forced near-abstinence was replete with statements about why the PML-N could not do certain things in power whereas on the other hand its government allowed a few other \"unwanted\" instances to take place.\n\nHe discussed with greater freedom the ghost or the evil spirit that had penetrated institutions and political parties in the country, but he broke from convention when giving a human face to this devilish being. He identified it as the ghost of Gen Musharraf, as opposed to the usual Pakistani practice of blaming all evil on Gen Ziaul Haq, the original Sharif mentor. And he hastened to add that this ghost didn't possess the whole institutions but was limited to occupying individuals working within these organisations.\n\nThis change obviously could be linked to Mian Nawaz Sharif's issues with Gen Musharraf and it was with some regret in his tone that Mr Rashid spoke on the subject of how his government was unable to bar the general behind the 1999 coup from going abroad.\n\n\"Other institutions did not help us in stopping Musharraf,\" he said simply.\n\nUltimately, the former information minister did mention his own sacking but implied it was a source of pride for him by describing it as a sacrifice to help democracy survive.

I shall call it the ghost of Musharraf, which is present even in the political parties, in political minds, and also in other institutions. \"I won't name any institution, but there are many cases,\" Rashid told a TV channel in an interview.\n\nThe former information minister, who was sacked due to his 'failure' to stop publication of a controversial story about a national security meeting in October last year, also obliquely criticised the role of interior ministry in what was called the Dawn Leaks saga.\n\nHe said: \"A member of the interior ministry was part of the committee formed to probe the controversy but despite of that the decision came against us.\"\n\nNisar critical of Yaqoob's appointment\n\n\"Democracy is still weak. It stumbles, it is pushed and pulled, and I happily offered myself as a sacrifice to save it. My PM (Sharif) also believes in this philosophy and therefore he also exercises patience.\"\n\nReacting strongly to Rashid's interview, Nisar said due to unknown reasons a few people were shifting blame of their own mistakes on the Interior Ministry and the establishment. \"If they are so innocent, these people should advise the government to make Dawn Leaks committee report public,\" he said.\n\nNisar said a six-member team that investigated Dawn Leaks, had only one official from interior ministry while the rest of the five members represented the federal or provincial governments.\n\n\"Instead of talking in riddles they should also have moral courage to clearly explain to the nation about the conspiracy,\" Nisar said in a clear reference to ambiguous statements coming from different PML-N leaders, including former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.\n\nWhatever the verdict, accept it, Nisar advises PM\n\nTo a question about the alleged role of establishment in the sacking of Nawaz Sharif, Rashid earlier said the events that unfolded were the result of a frame of mind. \"The PTI played the role of a pawn. They are pawns to a particular mindset which has to be changed by being faced head on, he said.\n\nHe said Musharraf had admitted that 'someone else' helped him in going abroad when he was being tried for high treason by a special court.\n\n\"We had no role in it [in removing Musharraf's name from no-fly list]. But we could not stop him from leaving. This is because stopping him was not something we could do unilaterally.

said he will address a press conference on an as yet undisclosed matter on Sunday evening.\n\nThe news accompanied media reports that PML-N leader and Chief Minister Punjab Shahbaz Sharif had appealed to other party leaders to desist from attacking state institutions in their speeches and avoid any confrontation with organs of the state.\n\nWhile it is not clear what Nisar's press conference will be about, senior Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz politician Pervaiz Rashid's criticism of the former interior minister on Friday had caused the latter to hit back, saying he did not know why \"some people have put the burden of all their mistakes and blunders on the ministry of interior and the establishment\".\n\nIn a TV interview, the first salvo was fired by Rashid who sounded a upset with Nisar on what the interior ministry could and could not have done during Nawaz Sharif's third term as prime minister.\n\nWithout providing any details, he spoke of decisions taken by the interior ministry headed by Chaudhry Nisar that went against the PML-N.\n\nNisar responded within no time and issued a statement through his spokesperson, saying Rashid should have explained as to what kind of help he expected from the interior ministry to \"cover up their deeds\".\n\nThe former interior minister, through his spokesperson, also advised Mr Rashid to ask \"his government\" to make public the news leak report -- which led to Rashid's ouster from office as information minister -- to prove his innocence.\n\nThe PML-N has been upping the ante in its rhetoric surrounding Nawaz Sharif's ouster by the Supreme Court, framing the decision as part of a long-running conspiracy against democracy perpetrated by the 'usual suspects'.\n\nThe party's criticism of the legacy of dictatorships as the root cause behind Nawaz's ouster has sometimes blurred the distinction between past dictators and the people heading state institutions.\n\nFor example, during his 'homecoming' rally from Islamabad to Lahore, Nawaz had accused the judiciary of being complicit in the military's toppling of his preceding government while challenging it to hold dictators accountable the way, he said, civilian rulers are taken to task.\n\nIn a later interview, he also said he alone could not be held responsible for creating friction between state institutions.\n\nSome party stalwarts, including Nisar and Shahbaz, have previously warned against such posturing, with the former interior minister saying at one point that there is too much at stake for Nawaz to create a situation that might result in conflict between institutions.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T11:17:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7372549176216125, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373374", "time": "11:17:00",

It may be noted that the home constituency of Nisar comprises 41 UCs of which 40 belong to the ruling party.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T02:03:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 259, "textStart": 251, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-09", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.47843137383461, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373374", "time": "02:03:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373374", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "R\u0101walpindi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "173", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Panama"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Panama"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "48300", "label": {"eng": "R\u0101walpindi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawalpindi", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "R\u0101walpindi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "48501", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "48650", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "303836", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Controlled-access highway"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway", "score": 2}, {"id": "304679", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sheikh"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh", "score": 2}, {"id": "307776", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Nawaz Sharif"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawaz_Sharif", "score": 5}, {"id": "307782", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Nisar Ali Khan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisar_Ali_Khan", "score": 3}, {"id": "366049", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Nation"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nation", "score": 3}, {"id": "376729", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Muslim League (N)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Muslim_League_(N)", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 4}, {"id": "376839", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Union councils of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_councils_of_Pakistan", "score": 3}, {"id": "527977", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Grand Trunk Road"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Trunk_Road", "score": 4}, {"id": "823300", "label": {"eng": "Rawat, Murree"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawat,_Murree", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 3}, {"id": "1324960", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Babar Bhatti"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babar_Bhatti", "score": 2}], "image": "http://nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2017-08-20/nisar-s-mysterious-role-in-ousted-prime-minister-rally-1503175483-3723.jpg", "timeCrawl": "02:03:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Nisar's mysterious role in ousted prime minister rally", "originalArticle": null}

Why that matters", "body": "Two endangered Mexican gray wolves were released in the Peloncillo Mountains of southern Arizona as wildlife managers try to expand the range of the predators.\n\nThe two wolves, officially known as F1828 and M2774, would become the first pack to roam Arizona's Sky Islands in decades and the southernmost wolf pack in the U.S.\n\n\"The hope is that as populations continue to expand in numbers, they will continue to expand southward and eventually meet up with this pair of wolves or some of their progeny,\" said Jim deVos, the Mexican wolf coordinator for the Arizona Game and Fish Department.\n\nThe wolves, named Llave and Wonder by advocates, were removed from the wild in 2023 and paired in captivity over the winter. Before releasing Llave, wildlife managers confirmed she is pregnant.\n\nState and federal wildlife agencies previously released family packs to establish a wild population. Now that the wolves' numbers are growing, adult releases have become more uncommon, as the wolf recovery program focuses on fostering genetically valuable captive-born pups into wild dens.\n\nWildlife advocates praised agencies for this release and said they'd like the agencies to authorize more in the future.\n\n\"Restoring these wolves to the wild is definitely worth celebrating,\" said Chris Smith, southwest wildlife advocate for Wild Earth Guardians.\n\n\"The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would do well to release more bonded family packs of endangered lobos in the Southwest to help ease the genetic crisis this species is facing,\" he said.\n\n100 foster pups: Mexican gray wolf packs grow with captive-born pups. Will it help the species survive?\n\nLlave and Wonder were born in Arizona within the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area.\n\nLlave was captured and relocated to Mexico in 2022 when she reached breeding age. She found a mate, M1582, and the pair wandered back over the U.S. border, setting up a territory in the Peloncillo Mountains.\n\n\"The fact that she was able to connect the Mexican and United States wolf populations is really rare,\" Smith said.\n\nAfter her mate was killed in 2023, Llave roamed on her own.\n\nShe likely sought a new mate in territory unoccupied by other wolves, who primarily live farther north. Lone wolves isolated from the primary population do not contribute to Mexican wolf recovery, unable to find mates and produce offspring.\n\nWildlife managers recaptured her and paired her with Wonder, hoping they would breed. The two spent the winter in captivity at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico.\n\n\"We're at least giving her a chance to play a role in recovery by pairing her with an available male,\" deVos said.\n\nBoth wolves wear satellite collars to monitor their movements around the Sky Islands and watch for denning activity, which usually occurs when the wolves become localized in one area during the spring.\n\n\"It's important that they are close to the Mexican border because part of the long-term plan is to have the exchange of wolves from north to south and south to north across international boundaries,\" deVos said.\n\nMexico started reintroducing wolves in 2011, and according to the 2022 revised Mexican wolf recovery plan, about 31 wolves were living in Chihuahua and Sonora, Mexico, in 2017.\n\nAlthough advocates believe few wild wolves remain in Mexico, officials hope that as the populations grow and disperse, individuals can more easily move and exchange genetics.\n\nMexican gray wolves: Asha, the adventurous wolf, is recaptured, paired with a male to mate\n\nSmith believes Llave's international journey in and out of captivity is representative of the challenges Mexican wolf recovery faces.\n\n\"This confluence of factors tell the challenges of Mexican wolf recovery,\" Smith said. \"The failure of the Mexico program, the impacts that Trump's border wall has on the population as a whole, possible illegal killings. Her resilience and the fact that the feds did the right thing is worth celebrating.\"\n\nSmith and wolf advocates want the state and federal wildlife agencies to release more family packs, believing those releases are more effective in diversifying the wild population's gene pool.\n\n\"If you picked any two wild wolves at random and did a genetic test on them, they would likely be, on average, as related as siblings,\" Smith said.\n\nWild Mexican wolf pups have a 50% chance to live to their first year, and 70% of yearlings survive to breeding age at two years old, according to USFWS. Smith believes older wolves have a better chance of living in the wild and disseminating their genes.\n\nLlave's release was a special case and does not signal a return to more pack releases, according to AZGFD.\n\ndeVos says there is a geographical benefit to fostering wolf pups instead of family units. By splitting a litter of genetically valuable foster pups between multiple wild dens, deVos believes their genes will be spread more widely in a shorter period.\n\nWolves tend to stay with their natal packs until they reach breeding age, before wandering to mate and start a new pack.\n\n\"We're geographically spreading that genetic material, rather than having all of those pups in one single pack in a single area,\" deVos said.\n\nHayleigh Evans covers environmental issues for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.

A species that is of great concern to me and my constituents back in Oregon and as can be seen by the attendance at today's hearing, many of you.\n\nToday's hearing is coming on the heels of a great success on the House floor back in Washington. On Tuesday evening, the House of Representatives passed in a bi-partisan fashion H.R. 764, a bill entitled the \"Trust the Science Act,\" which would require the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reissue the 2020 Trump Administration rule that delisted the gray wolf in the lower 48 states.\n\nWhat was discussed during floor debate and what will be central to today's discussion is when should we declare the gray wolf an ESA recovery success story and who should be in charge of managing populations going forward. My unequivocal answer to those questions is that the number of wolves we have on the landscape today is more than enough to consider the species recovered and that states are best equipped to manage gray wolf populations going forward.\n\nTake my home state of Oregon, where we have the peculiar situation in my district where a highway determines whether wolves are listed under the ESA or not. West of the highway, they are listed, east of the highway, they are not. We currently have roughly 250 wolves in Oregon, which the state seems to believe is enough and does not want the population to grow any further. This stands in stark contrast to where we sit today here in Minnesota, where there are at least 10 times as many wolves on the landscape. In the neighboring states of Wisconsin and Michigan, there are roughly an additional 1,700 wolves combined. According to testimony heard by this subcommittee last year during the consideration of H.R. 764, federal recovery goals in this region have been met since at least 1994, yet the gray wolf is still listed.\n\nWhy is this such an important issue to us here today and why does the gray wolf's perpetual listing under the ESA matter? The answer is simple, the ESA was not intended for species to be listed permanently, as some would like to believe, and the consequences of an unmanaged wolf population have dire impacts on our constituents. As we will hear from witnesses today, unmanaged wolf populations have a devastating impact on farmers and ranchers, other wildlife species, and the communities that depend upon them. The fact is that wolves are apex predators who rely on killing other animals to survive, whether they are a farmer's cattle or wild moose living out in the forests of Minnesota. The management of wolf populations is the only logical path forward that can strike a balance between maintaining a healthy population and protecting the way of life of so many of our constituents. The good news is that states have already proven to be capable wildlife managers. This was confirmed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service two months ago when they denied petitions to list gray wolves in the Western United States and relist them in the Northern Rockies Ecosystem, an area where wolves have been delisted for over a decade. The Service stated that wolves are \"not at risk of extinction in the Western United States now or in the foreseeable future.\" The Service also stated that wolves in the Western United States had a healthy abundance, retained genetic diversity, have the ability to respond to high-mortality events, and maintain adaptive capacity.\n\nInstead of sitting on our hands and allowing the issues associated with an unmanaged wolf population to grow, we as members of Congress must continue to act to ensure the voices of our constituents are heard and that we do everything we can to delist the gray wolf. The action on the House floor this week was one step in the right direction, and I believe this hearing today will continue that path forward.\n\nThis hearing provided a platform for experts and those impacted to testify on the gray wolf population surge's multifaceted implications, including its economic, ecological, and societal ramifications. Ranchers, farmers, and outdoorsmen alike are fed up with the way the federal government has handled the gray wolf population surge and are ready to change!\"\n\n\"Absolutely not. Wolves are somewhere around 100 pounds. They do not kill animals and then eat them. They just start eating them. And they keep eating them until they get to something vital and then the animal dies. It's one of the most horrific deaths you can have. They also pack hunt, or they individually hunt, so if an individual gets beaten by a cow, he'll bring a friend back, and they'll win eventually. They also traumatize those animals that they leave alive. I can go on, but in no way a 110-pound wolf that is a born killer is anything close to a pet.\"\n\nThe Great Lakes region has the largest concentration of gray wolves in the lower 48 states, with approximately 4,200 wolves that inhabit the states of Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Under the current management framework, wolves in Minnesota are listed as threatened, whereas wolves in Michigan and Wisconsin are listed as endangered. The recovery plan for the gray wolf in the Great Lakes is clear when it comes to criteria for delisting, a stable or increasing population of wolves in Minnesota and at least 200 wolves outside of the Minnesota population.\n\nThe Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations have all agreed that the gray wolf species is recovered and should be delisted, but extreme environmental groups and activist judges have stopped the delisting attempts by multiple administrations. The gray wolf should be celebrated as an Endangered Species Act success story. Recent scientific analysis by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service show that the gray wolf population is healthy and can sustain itself. The case for delisting is clear, and on April 30, 2024, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 764, the Trust the Science Act, which would remove the recovered gray wolf from the endangered species list.\n\nLast week's hearing in Sandstone, Minn. was a chance for members to hear from local elected officials and wildlife experts to learn more about the gray wolf population and its impact on rural communities.\n\nWatch the complete hearing:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/Y32iGQ-YbCs?si=WeZwwomeVoU3IgBS", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title":

Nathan Wesenberg painted quite a picture of wolves in Minnesota in a recent interview, but unfortunately all his brushes were dipped in half-truths or red herrings ( \"Minnesota senator: Why the state needs a wolf hunt\" April 24 ).\n\nSen. Wesenberg's hostility toward wolves has long been clear. But he reached a new and dangerous low during the recent vote on the Senate's environment omnibus bill by attempting to add an amendment to force the state to hold a wolf trophy hunting and recreational trapping season -- even when wolves are federally protected under the Endangered Species Act, the same approach he took with a bill he sponsored this session. If either the amendment or the bill had passed -- and they didn't -- a court would have struck it down as unconstitutional, as a clear attempt to circumvent federal law.\n\nThose who call for a wolf season do so with hyperbolic claims and a vague nod to \"science.\" It's much simpler, really. A wolf hunt is a trophy hunt, period. This is not public policy; it's a sop to those who want to kill wolves.\n\nSen. Wesenberg's colorful claims notwithstanding, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has repeatedly confirmed that the state's wolf population has remained relatively stable , with little change in size or distribution, since the late 1990s. As apex carnivores, wolf populations are regulated by the availability of food and space to live; they don't need humans to kill them to \"control\" their numbers.\n\nThe proponents of wolf hunts tend to cling to fairytale representations to inspire fear (the \"big bad wolf\" approach), but the truth is far less sensational: Talk to researchers who routinely travel the woods studying wolves, and they'll tell you they have no concerns for their safety.\n\nLikewise, wolves are not huffing and puffing around little pigs' houses. According to USDA Wildlife Services and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, less than 2% of the livestock farms in areas where wolves live experience conflicts in any given year. That rate has stayed relatively stable since the late 1990s as well. Moreover, those farmers who do experience conflicts are reimbursed for their losses.\n\nStudies show that the best way to prevent conflicts from occurring in the first place is through nonlethal deterrents like fencing and guardian animals, and removing attractants like the carcasses of livestock animals who die from other causes. We have a great example of that right here in Minnesota, with a fencing project led by the Voyageur's Wolf Project. It's worth noting too that because wolves in Minnesota are listed as \"threatened\" under the Endangered Species Act, USDA Wildlife Services already has the authority to kill them in response to conflicts.\n\nProponents of killing wolves might ask, \"But what about deer?\" as their last-ditch argument, but that quickly falls apart in the face of scientific data and studies . It's winter weather that has the largest impact on deer populations; killing wolves will not boost deer numbers. As the DNR itself has stated , \"Research in Minnesota strongly suggests that wolves have not caused large-scale or long-term declines in deer.\"\n\nIt comes down to this: once we strip away the embellishments, fearmongering, culture-warring and smoke and mirrors, there are no legitimate grounds for the implementation of wolf trophy hunting and recreational trapping seasons in Minnesota.", "source": {"uri": "inforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "INFORUM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophy_hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trophy hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesenberg,_Mecklenburg-Vorpommern", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wesenberg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wesenberg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Wesenberg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Wesenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act_of_1973", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Endangered Species Act of 1973"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibus_bill", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omnibus bill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Herring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carnivore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Department_of_Natural_Resources", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Department of Natural Resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carrion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Exotic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Exotic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/aa3bfc0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1055x790+0+0/resize/1424x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc2%2Fdb%2F07a5f3b9488bbbb8bec7af22411c%2Fwolf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542824", "eventUri": "eng-9542824", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 314, "textEnd": 322}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The lawsuit was filed by the Great Lakes Wildlife Alliance, also known as Friends of the Wisconsin Wolf & Wildlife.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that Department of Natural Resources policy board members collected comments on the wolf management plan from interest groups it favored even after the public comment period ended.\n\nThe lawsuit focused on three private discussions attended by members of the board hosted by the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation, the Wisconsin Association of Sporting Dogs, and Wisconsin Wolf Facts.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that even though a quorum of board members didn't attend any of the meetings, enough of them participated to influence changes to the plan in violation of the state open meetings law.\n\nThe judge said the open meetings law did not apply to the meetings in question because there was not a sufficient number of board members present to constitute a meeting.\n\nEhlke also rejected allegations of due process and administrative procedure violations. The judge also rejected arguments that comments by Great Lakes Wildlife Alliance were ignored during formation of the wolf plan.\n\nThe group didn't cite any case to back up their discrimination claims, Ehlke said. Allowing them to allege that they were discriminated against would mean that anyone could make that argument when a governmental body does something they don't like, the judge said.\n\n\"This makes no sense to me and would cause governmental operations to grind to a halt,\" the judge said.\n\nSusann Bradford, attorney for the Great Lakes Wildlife Alliance, asked the judge to reconsider the ruling. The judge denied that request. Bradford said after the hearing that the group was reviewing whether to file an appeal.\n\nFarmers in northern Wisconsin have complained for years that the wolf population is multiplying too quickly and preying on their livestock. Hunters say wolves are devastating the deer population across the northern reaches of the state. Conservationists argue that wolves have yet to firmly establish themselves in Wisconsin and need protection.\n\nThe DNR's board adopted the wolf management plan in October. It recommends maintaining the statewide population at about 1,000 wolves but doesn't set a hard limit. The plan instead recommends allowing the population to grow or decline at certain numerical thresholds.\n\nState wildlife officials have said a lack of a hard limit gives the DNR more flexibility to manage the species, allows local wolf packs to fluctuate and gives the population a better chance at maintaining wolf abundance for years to come.\n\nHunting advocates support setting a population limit, saying the lack of a goal leaves both wolves and people unprotected. Conservation groups opposed a provision related to how the DNR would respond to certain population ranges in different parts of the state.\n\nLast year, a federal judge placed gray wolves in the lower 48 states back on the endangered species list, making hunting illegal and limiting farmers to nonlethal control methods, such as fencing in livestock or using guard dogs.

Will it help the species survive?", "body": "SPRINGERVILLE -- Allison Greenleaf, a senior wildlife biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, had squeezed herself into a narrow hole dug among the rocks of a steep mountainside in Arizona's White Mountains.\n\nThe crevice was so tight, she could only reach forward with one arm, feeling for little bundles of fur in the back. Nestled amid sticks and tufts of soft hair were two endangered Mexican gray wolf pups.\n\nGreenleaf estimates she had been in about 100 dens before, but this was the toughest to navigate. As she grabbed the two pups and tried to wiggle back out, she realized her head was stuck.\n\n\"I've never been in a den where I haven't been able to contort my body enough to get the pups,\" Greenleaf said, sporting a scrape on her cheek from pulling her head free from the den. \"It's tight and a little unnerving.\"\n\nGreenleaf only managed to extract one of the two pups, born about two weeks ago into the Prime Canyon wolf pack. As she emerged, three captive-born wolf pups and a small team of humans awaited.\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service and the Arizona Game and Fish Department were placing the captive-born pups into a wild pack. One of them was the 100th pup in the fostering program, a significant milestone in Mexican wolf recovery.\n\nThe three pups, one male and two females, came from genetically valuable parents at the Living Desert Zoo & Gardens State Park in Carlsbad, New Mexico. The team placed them into a wild pack in hopes of integrating the genes into the population.\n\nAfter rubbing all four pups together, ensuring they smelled the same so the wild mother would accept the fosters as her own, Greenleaf wished them luck and pushed them back into the den to await the mother's return.\n\nThe interagency effort placing genetically valuable pups into wild dens is a highly organized program that officials believe bolsters the population's genetic diversity while minimizing conflict with ranchers and the surrounding communities.\n\nGreenleaf participated in the first pup fostering in 2014, relocating wild-born pups into another wild den. The alpha male of the Prime Canyon pack was one of the first captive foster pups released in 2016 and survived to parent litters officials have repeatedly fostered into.\n\n\"It's a pretty neat thing to be a part of the first one and then be part of the hundredth one,\" Greenleaf said. \"Fostering is a good way to get those genetics out there, and I think it's more palatable for the public.\"\n\nSome advocates question the success of the program, as a minimum of 18 out of 83 pups released as of 2022 are known to have survived to breeding age. They believe releasing adult family packs is a better way to integrate genetics into the larger population.\n\n\"If you release well-bonded family packs of wolves, not only do those wolves have a functional base from a social standpoint, but those will stand a much better chance of actually injecting new genetic information into the wild population,\" said Chris Smith, southwest wildlife advocate for Wildlife Guardians.\n\nWhy do wolf managers foster captive-born pups in the wild?\n\nMexican gray wolves are one of the most endangered wolf subspecies, first listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1976. Wildlife agencies launched a captive breeding population from the seven remaining wolves in the 1970s.\n\nThe agencies began releasing wolves into the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area in 1998, which includes mountain and woodlands in the wolves' historic range in Arizona and New Mexico, south of Interstate 40.\n\nThe captive population has grown to about 380 animals, and the 2023 wolf count found a minimum of 257 wolves in the wild. Despite the growth in population over the last eight years, wildlife managers and biologists worry that a lack of genetic diversity from just seven founders could negatively affect the subspecies.\n\nAny two wolves in the wild population are roughly the genetic equivalent to being siblings. USFWS launched the captive foster program in 2016 to address this concern.\n\n\"Our captive population has higher genetics because we're basically able to play God and say who breeds in captivity, and in the wild, we can't do that,\" said Brady McGee, the Mexican wolf coordinator for USFWS.\n\n\"The main reason we're fostering these puppies into the wild is to boost the genetics in the wild. We're not trying to grow the population anymore,\" he said. \"It's growing on its own.\"\n\nOnce the foster pups reach breeding age in about two years, they will leave their natal pack to find mates. This helps disseminate their genetics into the population, strengthening the subspecies' ability to survive and reproduce.\n\nOfficials believe releasing pups is more socially acceptable to neighboring communities than releasing adult family packs into new areas.\n\nWolves are territorial, and releasing adult wolves into already occupied areas would increase the chance of conflict. Releasing more adults would populate new areas, potentially upsetting ranchers and neighboring residents.\n\n\"The huge benefit to this is that social tolerance,\" said John Oakleaf, senior wolf scientist for USFWS. \"This is more socially acceptable because this is where wolves already exist. People get angry when you're changing what's there, but with fostering, we're just changing the genetics\"\n\nWolf territories: Wolves can't read maps, but wildlife managers say habitat borders are still effective\n\nTeams race to get pups into their new den\n\nMcGee describes foster operations as a \"relay race with puppies,\" as wildlife managers hurry to place week-old pups in the wild, passing them from team to team. When placing the 100th pup and his siblings, the teams completed a multi-state operation in about seven hours, taking precautions to minimize the risk of human scents clinging to the pups.\n\nWhen a captive mother whelps, or gives birth on her own, managers match her pups with a wild den using GPS coordinates from radio collars placed on packs' breeding alpha male and female. The pups must be only a few days apart in age.\n\nThe pups are flown from one of about 60 captive breeding facilities across the U.S. and Mexico to Springerville Municipal Airport. Veterinary staff conduct health exams on the pups and they are trucked to a staging area close to the wild den.\n\n\"Time is trauma and a big medical consideration,\" said Susan Dicks, a veterinarian for USFWS. \"We plan everything very carefully to diminish the time to keep these puppies safe.\"\n\nEach person handling the pups has to de-scent their clothes and shoes, using de-scenting spray and bleach to ensure the pups do not carry human scents and are accepted by the mother.\n\nA ground crew is sent out before the captive pups arrive, tasked with locating the den. The mother and any nearby pack members will usually flee when the team nears the den, afraid of humans.\n\nPhysically small team members like Greenleaf crawl in to extract the pups.\n\nThey take cheek swabs of all the pups for genetic testing and microchip each one to help identify them if they are captured as adults. Once the captive pups arrive, the team has to ensure all of the pups smell the same so the mother wolf accepts them all.\n\n\"We put them into a little puppy pile and we stimulate them to get them all to pee on each other because we want them all to smell the same,\" Greenleaf said. \"We rub them all together and put them back in the den.\"\n\n\"Usually I'm in the office, so these are the days that remind me why I got into this field in the first place,\" she said.\n\nImperiled predators: Are Mexican gray wolves closer to recovery 25 years after they were returned to the wild?\n\nRanchers and wildlife advocates question the program's success\n\nWhen wildlife managers began releasing captive wolves, they needed to establish the population. Now that the population is growing on its own, they prioritize fostering for genetic diversity rather than releasing adult family groups to increase numbers.\n\nThis strategy also addresses human-wolf conflict. But ranchers and wildlife advocates question whether the program succeeds in either goal.\n\nMcGee said captive-born wolves raised to adulthood were not afraid of people, sometimes associating them with food.\n\n\"We had wolves show up early in the program on people's back porches eating their dog food,\" McGee said. \"They're used to people, they don't know how to hunt and it takes them a while to figure that out.\"\n\nFoster pups are raised by wild packs, learning how to survive and avoid humans, as crews haze packs to steer clear of ranches and communities.\n\nAlthough the fostering program is more socially acceptable than family pack releases, ranchers like Wink Crigler believe any wolves on the landscape will endanger her herd.\n\nCrigler owns X Diamond Ranch outside Eagar and said wolves have repeatedly targeted her cattle. She remembers when a pet calf was killed by a pack of wolves in her front yard, feet away from her door.\n\n\"In my opinion, it's an exercise in futility,\" Crigler said. \"A wolf is a carnivore. He's a predator. If you've got wolves, there's no living peacefully in harmony.\"\n\nWildlife advocates question the program for opposite reasons. Smith believes releasing packs with adults and pups have a higher chance of survival as a family unit.\n\n\"Putting captive-born wolves into wild dens and hoping that those wolves not only survive but then reach breeding age and actually breed, the odds of all those things happening are pretty low,\" Smith said.\n\nDespite qualms about the program's effectiveness, the fostering team is hopeful the Prime Canyon pack will successfully raise all five pups to breeding age.\n\nAfter Greenleaf and the ground team retreats, the mother and her packmates will return to the den. Her hormones will likely overwhelm any confusion about three extra inhabitants in the den.\n\nShe will quickly move the pups to a new den after the disturbance, typically within a quarter-mile of the original site.\n\nThe Prime Canyon pack has raised foster pups before, and the alpha male was a foster himself, equipped with stronger genes that help him survive in the wild.\n\n\"I remember the den site that guy went into. I held him,\" Dicks said, celebrating the program's success. \"Now it's a full-circle moment.\"\n\nHayleigh Evans covers environmental issues for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.

That's where Llave was living when she was captured by wildlife managers in November.\n\n\"This was her territory that she dispersed to naturally,\" Anderson said. \"This was a place that she picked. Now she's back, and that's awesome.\"\n\nThe Mexican subspecies of gray wolf was once common in parts of the southwestern U.S. and Mexico, but by the 1970s it had been hunted, trapped and poisoned to near-extinction.\n\nIn 1998, wildlife managers began releasing and monitoring captive-bred wolves across Eastern Arizona and Western New Mexico as part of a cooperative reintroduction effort among nine federal, state and tribal agencies led by the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nAs of last year, there were at least 257 wolves roaming the experimental population area designated for the species, which covers a vast swath of the two states. The eighth consecutive year of population growth was seen in 2023, according to estimates from the Mexican Wolf Interagency Field Team.\n\nThe Arizona Game and Fish Department assisted the Fish and Wildlife Service with Monday's translocation, but neither agency publicized it.\n\nAnderson said she learned about the operation from a social media post by the Cochise-Graham Cattle Growers association.\n\nOn April 30, the ranching group advised its members that a wolf pair had been set free east of Douglas and reminded them to report any local wolf sightings to the Cochise County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAislinn Maestas, public affairs specialist for the Fish and Wildlife Service, said the site for Monday's translocation was selected \"with the intent to minimize impact on livestock producers.\"\n\nDen mother\n\nLlave was born into the Maverick Pack, whose traditional territory includes parts of Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest and the Fort Apache Indian Reservation.\n\nMaestas said wolf 1828 was captured for the first time and fitted with a tracking collar in 2018.\n\nThree years later, she was caught again and placed in captivity after straying onto the San Carlos Indian Reservation east of Globe.\n\n\"They don't tolerate wolves on their nation,\" Anderson explained.\n\nIn February 2022, wildlife officials returned Llave to the wild, this time in Mexico with her partner at the time, male wolf No. 1582.\n\n\"The thought was if they were released together, they wouldn't have a reason to go wandering,\" Anderson said.\n\nBut the pair had other ideas. After just a few months south of the border, they crossed back into the U.S. to establish their home range in the \"bootheel\" of southwestern New Mexico.\n\nAnderson said data from Llave's tracking collar showed she and her partner moved freely between the U.S. and Mexico for much of 2022, then settled into the Peloncillos north of the border for the winter.\n\nLlave's movements suggested she was denned down with pups the following spring, when her mate turned up dead in New Mexico's Animas Valley.\n\n\"His death was suspicious. It's under investigation,\" Anderson said. \"It's likely that she lost her litter because her mate was killed.\"\n\nAfter that, Llave's collar continued to ping twice a day as she wandered through the Chiricahuas, past Fort Bowie and across Interstate 10 to reach Mount Graham.\n\nAnderson said the wolf might have been searching for others of her kind or trying to make her way north, back to the part of Arizona where she was born.\n\nShe eventually ended up back in the Peloncillos, where wildlife officials captured her again in November because there were no other potential mates for her in that area, Maestas said.\n\nWonder, or male wolf 2774, was also captured in November at the request of the San Carlos Apache Tribe, after he showed up on the reservation.\n\nHe was first collared in New Mexico as a yearling in the spring of 2023.\n\nA fresh start\n\nWonder and Llave spent the winter bonding at the wolf management facility at Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge south of Albuquerque.\n\nMaestas said the process of pairing up captive wolves starts with an introduction. The male and female are placed in adjacent pens with a shared fence line, so they can see and smell each other and interact in a safe way.\n\n\"We observe their behavior, watching for positive behaviors like play-bowing and tail-wagging,\" she said. \"Depending on how those interactions go, we then open the doors so they can be in the same enclosure.\"\n\nMaestas declined to say where Llave and Wonder went after their release on Monday. For the safety of the animals, the Fish and Wildlife Service does not share real-time tracking data.\n\nEventually, Maestas said, their general location will be added to a public online map maintained by the Mexican Wolf Interagency Field Team. The pair will show up on that map as the Manada del Arroyo pack, the same pack name Llave had when she and her previous mate were set free in Mexico.\n\n\"Restoring these wolves to the wild is definitely worth celebrating,\" said Chris Smith, southwest wildlife advocate for WildEarth Guardians, a Santa Fe, New Mexico-based environmental group. \"The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would do well to release more bonded family packs of endangered lobos into the Southwest to help ease the genetic crisis this species is facing.\"\n\nAnderson said she is thrilled to see Llave starting a new chapter after what has already been \"a fascinating life history.\"\n\nShe called it a testament to the species' resiliency and its millennia-long connection to the sky-island mountain ranges of Arizona and New Mexico.\n\n\"This is something to be excited about,\" Anderson said. \"Wolves belong here.\"\n\nContact reporter Henry Brean at hbrean@tucson.com.

The paintballs will be colourless so that the stain does not cause the wolf to be rejected by its pack.\n\nEarlier attempts to use paintball guns against wolves in the national park foundered when conservation organisation Faunabescherming challenged the province's reasoning in court.\n\nJudges agreed that the province had not made a strong enough case for using paintballs at the wolves, but later allowed the permit after the regional government commissioned a study by a wolf behaviour expert.\n\nFaunabescherming has said it will take the province to court again, arguing that EU rules forbid wolves being disturbed in their habitat.

They have few natural predators and can take down creatures many times their size by pack hunting.\n\nThe typical North American wolf weights around 80 pounds and is 4 to 5 feet in length. While they mainly hunt by sneaking up on unexpecting prey, encircling them, and slowly moving in on whatever is dinner that night, they can also show very impressive speed for a decent amount of time, reaching speeds of up to 40 miler per hour.\n\nWhich is really freaking fast.\n\nYou can see just how fast that is in a video captured by a woman headed to work in Behchoko, Northern Territories, Canada a few years back. She noticed the wolf sprinting down the side of the road while behind it and hurried to catch up, which was a bit harder than you'd expect due to the icy road conditions, but really due to just how fast this guy was going.\n\nHe was flying.\n\nI wish she would have showed the dashboard so we could gauge the speed, but either way there's no doubt this guy was moving at or above that 40 mph top speed the experts say they have.\n\nThank the Lord above we have cars and guns and all the cool human stuff.\n\nReally, wolves and brown bears aren't that different. They are both apex predators, who live to hunt and eat. They are both incredibly smart and strong compared to most of the animal kingdom, and both are fairly territorial especially with their food.\n\nThe real difference is size. These two are European sub-species, relatives of the wolves and brown bears in North America. These bears can weigh up to 500-pounds while the wolves max out around 80-pounds so a massive difference when it comes to a fight and competitive advantage.\n\nThis wolf is seen approaching a sleeping bear. You notice the bear is laying near down near something that is seemingly buried, AKA a prized possession.\n\nBrown bears love to bury their kills and come back at another time for meals. Big cats like mountain lions and bobcats do the same. Often times other animals will try to claim the food as their own, but that's an easy way to start a fight in a hurry... especially when your target belong to a bear.\n\nThis wolf, despite being on the young and skinny side (almost looks like a coyote), has some serious balls, though. He's going up to a brown bear that is directly on its kill, thinking it's going to steal a meal from right under his nose.\n\nThe bear quickly wakes up and is not impressed. I mean, for an animal that runs hot to begin with, this is a terrible way for him to wake up.\n\nThe wolf proceeds with caution but the bear simply stands on the kill and grits its teeth at the wolf as if to say \"try me.\"\n\nThe wolf tries multiple angles but has no luck at all and is eventually chased off.\n\nIt ain't easy trying to rob a bear... but hey, can't blame this hungry fella for trying.\n\nIt's easy to forget sometimes that these animals aren't just hanging around at Yellowstone National Park, they are actually out here desperately trying to survive.\n\nSeeing a wolf pack hunt is an incredible thing, as they work together so well. But when a lone wolf goes after a large animal like an elk you know they are serious hunters all on their own. A cow elk on average comes in at 500 to 600-pounds while a massive wolf would be 150-pounds... that shows you the incredible difference and how powerful and brave these dogs are.\n\nThe video starts with a wolf laying in the grass. Eventually it pans to an elk standing on the river side. Somehow the wolf gets to the other side of the river and is standing on the shore debating on jumping in after the elk. The elk realizes it is unsure of what to do so it stays put hoping it's in a safe zone.\n\nThe wolf crosses the river in a safer spot and runs and attacks the elk. Using its size to its advantage the elk wades through deep water to escape. The wolf, who might be in a little too deep, jumps from shore to shore getting in a good spot to attack as the elk continues to use the water to its advantage.\n\nThis shows how smart the animals really are, using their own strengths to their benefit at all times.\n\nThe elk does well, but eventually the wolf gets a really good attack going and takes the elk down. As the elk works its way into deeper waters, the wolf lets off. The elk stays in the high water and floats down river away from the wolf as the video ends.\n\nJust an absolute battle.\n\nAlthough the wolf comes up empty handed it shows they are elite killers, being able to give an adult elk a run for their money.\n\nMaybe the wolf caught up with the elk downstream... it's anyone's guess.", "source": {"uri": "whiskeyriff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whiskey Riff"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brown bear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Predation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_predator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apex predator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pack_hunter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pack hunter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contiguous United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Territories", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northwest Territories"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northwest Territories"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobcat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bobcat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cougar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cougar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyote", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coyote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pack_(canine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pack (canine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yellowstone National Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Animals", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.whiskeyriff.com/wp-content/uploads/Wolf-5.jpg?fit=923%2C563&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542824", "eventUri": "eng-9542824", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

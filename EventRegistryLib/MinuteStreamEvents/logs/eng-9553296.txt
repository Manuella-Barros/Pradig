Naturally, the image of the two locking lips went viral, leading fans to believe this was the sign of a new Hollywood relationship. Turns out, it was all just a moment of movie magic.\n\nThe pair was caught smooching in TriBeCa as they filmed their upcoming romantic comedy Materialists. Directed by Celine Song -- whose debut feature film, Past Lives, was nominated for Best Picture this year -- the flick will follow the dynamic between a matchmaker, a wealthy man she meets, and her ex. In addition to Dakota and Pedro, the movie also stars Chris Evans, Zo\u00eb Winters, Dasha Nekrasova, Louisa Jacobson, and Marin Ireland.\n\nMaterialists just began filming in New York in late April, according to World of Reel. There is no confirmed release date yet, but the movie is being distributed by A24 and produced by 2AM and Killer Films.\n\nTo make matters even more interesting, about a week ago, Dakota was seen filming a scene with costar Chris, and in a few paparazzi photos, the pair were captured kissing during their shoot as well. Materialists is clearly going to be a steamy film, to say the least.\n\nDakota is fresh off the release of superhero film Madame Web, while Evans just wrapped his Christmas action-comedy Red Ones, which costars Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and is set to hit theaters on November 15. Meanwhile, Pedro has a lot on his plate, as he just finished filming Gladiator II in January and is also starring in the noir thriller Tropico, which just began filming in April.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dakota Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Materialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celine_Song", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celine Song"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_Lives_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Past Lives (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasha_Nekrasova", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dasha Nekrasova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_Ireland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marin Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Evans (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribeca", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tribeca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tribeca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Award for Best Picture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Feature film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_Web_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madame Web (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A24", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A24"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2AM_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2AM (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_Films", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Killer Films"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film noir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paparazzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superhero film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gnYay_lGma4S2Os1.QHbmg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/a155168301a6093ebb7f9fab2ec47fc1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553296", "eventUri": "eng-9553296", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-15", "textStart": 1544, "textEnd": 1555}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

This will be a follow-up to Celine Song's Past Lives.\n\nPedro Pascal and Dakota Johnson recently made headlines for their on-set chemistry while filming their upcoming romantic comedy titled Materialists. The duo was spotted in a cosy embrace, sharing a sweet kiss that has left fans eagerly anticipating the film's release. In the scene captured by paparazzi, Dakota, looking effortlessly chic, wore a long black leather jacket paired with light-washed jeans and a matching handbag. Her brown hair cascaded down in a sleek, straight style. Pedro, on the other hand, exuded charm in a simple tanned suit jacket over a dark button-up shirt.\n\nAs fans eagerly await the release of Materialist, the on-screen chemistry between Pedro and Dakota has already created a buzz. The photos of their intimate scenes have sparked speculation about the film's plot and the nature of their characters' relationship.\n\nHere's a sneak peek of Dakota and Pedro's kiss:\n\nDirected by Celine Song, Materialist promises a romantic storyline between Pedro and Dakota's characters. However, IMDb's description of the film suggests a twist in the plot: \"A matchmaker's lucrative business gets complicated when she falls into a toxic love triangle that threatens her clients.\" This intriguing premise has only fueled fans' curiosity about the film's narrative and the dynamics between the lead characters.\n\nAdding to the intrigue is the inclusion of Chris Evans as the third love interest in the movie. His involvement hints at a complex and engaging storyline that promises to keep audiences captivated.\n\nDuring an interview with Variety, the director, Song revealed that Materialists is the follow-up to her previous film Past Lives which was released last year. Set in the bustling streets of New York, this romantic comedy deals with a female matchmaker who finds herself drawn to a wealthy bachelor. The film promises to deliver a fresh take on love, laughter, and the complexities of relationships in a fast-paced urban setting. However, the roles of Johnson, Pascal, and Evans in the upcoming film are still kept under wraps, and the release date is not officially confirmed either, reports Variety.\n\nMeanwhile, Dakota's recent projects have kept her in the limelight, but her role in Madame Web received mixed reviews from critics. Despite this, she remains a sought-after actress, and her performance in Materialist is highly anticipated.\n\nOnly time will tell how their story looks on the big screen, but one thing is certain: With its stellar star cast and Song's record of acclaimed works, Materialist is turning out to be a must-watch romantic comedy of the year.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dakota Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Materialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celine_Song", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Celine Song"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_Lives_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Past Lives (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paparazzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IMDb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_triangle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Love triangle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Evans (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matchmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_Web_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madame Web (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blaise Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/05/untitled-design-2024-05-09t183022.842-2024-05-7db7603a9485a450cdaa5e5c3576e3a1-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553296", "eventUri": "eng-9553296", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

It was only a matter of time, then, before the South Korean-Canadian playwright would be given the go-ahead on a second A24 project (the first one had her nominated for two Oscars!). But what will her next project be? A new rom-com, it turns out, Materialists, with The Last of Us actor and long-time GQ fave Pedro Pascal at the helm.\n\nWhile the 'rom' is nothing new from Song, the 'com' part is (although there were some low-key funny moments in Past Lives, if you like to laugh at stuff that could also make you cry). Before Past Lives, Song also directed a live recreation of Anton Chekhov's The Seagull using The Sims 4 on Twitch (yes, it is exactly what it sounds like - Sims characters controlled by Song in a reenactment of the famous 1895 Russian play). So, you know, she can really turn her hand to anything.\n\nIt's definitely a fun, interesting cast. Aside from the Daddy Pescal himself, the cast list also includes Dakota Johnson (Madame Web, Daddio), Chris Evans (Don't Look Up, Knives Out), Zo\u00eb Winters (who plays Logan Roy's younger love interest in Succession), Louisa Jacobson (The Gilded Age), Marin Ireland (The Umbrella Academy) and Dasha Nekrasova, who'll you'll probably know from the Red Scare podcast, but whom has also been in a bunch of stuff, including Succession as Comfrey the crisis PR rep.\n\nIt's still early days, so there's not a huge amount of info out there on Materialists plot-wise. However, we do know that it's a rom-com set in New York (good because all the best, most classic rom-coms are set in New York) and that it's about a \"high-end matchmaker\" who gets involved with a wealthy man.\n\nWho'll be playing who remains to be seen. Will Pedro be the rich man? Will Dakota be the matchmaker? (Possibly, considering the pair have been spotted making out on set). Will Chris Evans be, I don't know, Dakota's unimpressed other boyfriend? (Also possible, considering they've also been spotted making out on set). Will Nekrasova play the stepdaughter? The colleague? There are plenty of possibilities - none of them yet confirmed.\n\nConsidering the film has only just begun filming, it'll be a short while before we get a solid release date. Early next year? We'll update you.", "source": {"uri": "gq-magazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "British GQ"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@gq-magazine.co.uk", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_Lives_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Past Lives (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Materialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasha_Nekrasova", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dasha Nekrasova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Last of Us"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chris Evans (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dakota Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A24", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A24"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celine_Song", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celine Song"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teo_Yoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teo Yoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playwright", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playwright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greta Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_Web_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madame Web (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_Look_Up", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Don't Look Up"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitch (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Succession (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sims 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seagull", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Seagull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Chekhov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anton Chekhov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gilded_Age_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Gilded Age (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Umbrella_Academy_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Umbrella Academy (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_Ireland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marin Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.gq-magazine.co.uk/photos/663b9b1be13d7ffd902cdfa8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Celine-Song-Pedro-Pascal.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553296", "eventUri": "eng-9553296", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The two are set to dazzle in the upcoming romantic comedy 'Materialists,' helmed by Celine Song, and their on-screen romance is already causing a stir across the globe.\n\nA recent photo of Johnson and Pascal locked in a passionate kiss sent the internet into a frenzy. The duo was spotted in Tribeca, with Johnson, 34, tenderly holding the face of the dashing 49-year-old Pascal as they shared a moment of intimacy.\n\nThe image quickly went viral and offers a glimpse into the captivating world of \"Materialists,\" where Johnson's character intertwines with Pascal's in a tale of love, laughter, and self-discovery. With Johnson clad in a chic black leather jacket and Pascal exuding charm in a tan blazer, the scene epitomizes the stylish allure of New York City's streets and the magnetic pull of cinematic romance.\n\nJohnson, known for her captivating performances in \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" and \"The Social Network,\" brings her trademark blend of vulnerability and strength to her role in \"Materialists.\" Meanwhile, Pascal, celebrated for his captivating portrayal of characters like Oberyn Martell in \"Game of Thrones\" and the charismatic leading man in \"The Mandalorian,\" infuses the film with his irresistible charm and wit.\n\nUnder the direction of Celine Song, a master of poignant storytelling and sharp humor, 'Materialists' is set to revolutionize the romantic comedy genre.

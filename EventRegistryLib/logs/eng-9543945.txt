My father's family is from Poland and Ukraine, and many of our relatives perished in the Holocaust.\n\nI don't know if any of my ancestors were Zionists although I suspect some of them must have been. The definition of \"Zionist\" that I've always used is a person who believes the Jews deserve a state where they can be safe. That is something I believe. I also believe the Palestinians deserve a state where they can be safe, the Israeli occupation has been a disaster and Benjamin Netanyahu needs to be replaced.\n\nRead more: Hamas says it accepts cease-fire as Israel orders Palestinians to evacuate eastern Rafah\n\nAs for the suggestion that Jews, or more precisely Ashkenazi Jewish Israelis -- those of European heritage -- should book a one-way ticket to Warsaw, I realize it's not a point of view representative of the whole of the protesters on U.S. campuses. Yet it is undeniably a reflection of the \"settler colonialist\" position on Israel, a narrative that has gained traction despite more than half of Israeli Jews being Mizrahi -- that is, from the Middle East. Palestinians and Israelis are two Indigenous peoples occupying the land that is being fought over.\n\nAnd what about Poland? Almost 3 million Jews lived in Poland before World War II. Now the population that self-identifies as Jewish is less than 5,000. It's instructive to remember that most of the Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto, perhaps 300,000 , were taken to Treblinka where they were murdered alongside another 500,000 or so Jews.\n\nTreblinka is now a vast field covered with a massive memorial consisting of hundreds of stones laid side by side, pointing heavenward. I wandered among them and thought about the catastrophe that led to this place and what was now unfolding at universities across America -- the anti-Israel chants, Jewish students' fear of being on campus, the protests and counterprotests creating a climate of menace.\n\nRead more: Do the pro-Palestinian protests signal a generational shift in U.S. attitudes about Israel?\n\nThe same day my family visited Treblinka, another Columbia student, described as a leader of the protests there, was quoted in the New York Times as saying, \"Zionists don't deserve to live.\" He apologized, and I don't want to compare him to Nazis. He and his compatriots are young and with youth comes the right to let your heart dominate your brain. His words, however, wore a swastika.\n\nOf course, what has happened to the Palestinian people since 1948 has been its own catastrophe, of which the war in Gaza is the latest iteration. The number of civilian deaths is appalling, the suffering of the families profound and seemingly endless. It is not hard to understand the anger and heartbreak animating pro-Palestinian encampments, although one wishes more protesters would acknowledge that the Israeli onslaught did not occur in a vacuum, and that Hamas itself has an affinity for dead Palestinians.\n\n\"Go back to Poland\" taunts are grotesque and willfully misinformed. To read about them while in Poland, where a ghost country of murder victims exists alongside the current population, is deeply disorienting. Where a synagogue used to be is now a delicatessen; a ritual bathhouse is a police station; a cemetery a derelict patch of ground or a verdant grove in the woods bereft of gravestones because they were stolen to be used to pave roads. So many Jews died in Poland that you could say that the entire country is a Jewish cemetery. In Poland, Jews are like the Native Americans in America. They are celebrated, sometimes sincerely, but mostly they are erased.\n\nRead more: UCLA faculty protest at Hammer Museum gala, decrying treatment of pro-Palestinian students\n\nWe visited a town that was nearly 100% Jewish before the war; now not one Jew lives there and there is virtually no indication that Jews ever made it their home. I am by inclination sympathetic to the protesters. I am even inclined to forgive their ahistorical point of view, although it is ironic given that so many of them are being educated at elite institutions. But they must know: Jewish collective trauma, like that of the Palestinians, is undeniable. One shouldn't have to go to places like Treblinka to be reminded of this. Have we learned nothing?\n\nThat the protesters are not all antisemitic is a given. Some will happily take a break from chanting \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\" to inform you that they count Jews among their number. And yet, from their encampments in privileged Los Angeles and Manhattan, they envision a progressive paradise where everyone's wounds are salved and racism a dim memory, but there is no place for Zionists, which for many (once again: not all!) is simply a dog whistle meaning Jews.\n\nGo back to Poland? It is impossible. And the maximalist daydreams of American protesters will not help Palestinians.\n\nSeth Greenland is the Los Angeles-based author of six novels and a memoir.

They won't buy an umbrella because they see clouds in the sky, but instead will wait until they are drenched and have pneumonia.\n\nIn the United States, Jews are in great danger. They are unprotected, second-class citizens. No one believes that if African-Americans or gay people were under attack at campuses nationwide, they'd be treated this way. The world would be in an uproar. Yet, once again, it's perfectly acceptable to hate Jews.\n\nWe must realize that Jewish history requires American Jews to have a plan B.\n\nIn New York City, Jews are terrified, wondering if they will be safe. Even if a perpetrator is arrested, they can be put right back onto the street due to New York's bail reform laws. Jews have been attacked all across the city, and are being banished or assaulted at Columbia, NYU, and other educational and cultural institutions.\n\nJews are lost, without a unified leadership that has any organized plan to combat this hatred. Most have never before seen an environment where open antisemitism flourishes. And while a handful of Jewish youth have valiantly stood up, we largely see an American Jewry kvetching, complaining, bereft of the will or ability to truly fight back. Judaism requires action and self-defense, not just a brain.\n\nOn campuses where we hear \"From the River to the Sea\" -- a call for mass murder of Jews -- one wonders at what point do American Jews point to Hillel, the largest Jewish organization for students in the US, and ask \"where have you been?\" Have all of the years of multi-cultural dialogue with the Muslim community gotten us anywhere?\n\nI haven't heard of a single DEI program to support Jews at any of the schools featuring mass protests, or a single company counseling Jews who feel scared or in need. And we've seen silence from all of these liberals who have lectured us on these snowflake values for years.\n\nAt what point do American Jews consider plan B -aliyah to Israel? Some will argue that we're not close to the time that Jews need to flee for our safety. Others argue we must stay and fight. But any American Jew who doesn't have a plan B hasn't read Jewish history. In Israel, Jews can live a real Jewish life. It's not easy, but what happens if this becomes the last resort?\n\nThe materials being distributed on campus are heinous and atrocious. They feature calls for \"resistance,\" the glorification of terrorism, and support for Hamas and its massacre of 1,200 Israelis on October 7.\n\nThese are direct calls for violence at universities -- and nothing will happen to the vast amount of these protestors who call for mass murder.\n\nWe live in a new world -- or maybe an ancient one.

(Sarah Reingewirtz/MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images)\n\nGo back to Poland! Zionists deserve to die! Gas the Jews! These are the chants that Jews are hearing throughout the world.\n\nTake off your kippah! Remove your mezuzah! Hide your Magen David necklace!\n\nFollowing seven months of relentless campaigning comprising marches, canceling of Jewish creators, bullying of Jews on university campuses, random attacks on Jews in the streets, and a hostile media adopting the Hamas narrative, it has become popular on social media for Jews to make analogies between the antisemitism of the 1930s and today.\n\nJewish communities are in shock as they reel from the tsunami of antisemitism unleashed on October 7. To suggest that this is the 1930s revisited is both alarmist and a fallacy.\n\nAfter World War II, the nations that defeated the Nazis attempted to set up a world order where the lessons of the Holocaust would be gleaned. That the new global order as exemplified by the United Nations has failed miserably to achieve the goals of its precursors is not the primary barometer.\n\nIn almost every country, the political establishment will disavow and condemn antisemitism. That there is antagonism towards Israel and by extension, Jews is not denied. But no country apart from Iran and its allies wishes to be tarred with the stain of antisemitism even if its behavior toward Israel often crosses the boundaries. Even rabid antisemites such as Roger Waters and George Galloway deny being antisemitic.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to the situation before World War II. Europe was rife with antisemitism. The Jews of pre-war Europe cowered in fear.\n\nAntisemitism has always been present. Sometimes it bubbles under the surface and other times, such as the present, it boils over.\n\nToday, Jews are empowered in most democratic societies to stand up and defend themselves. Many countries have some form of regulatory environment to defend against racism. Are they effective? Not on a practical level. Notwithstanding, racism is eschewed; the challenge is to ensure that history's oldest manifestation of racism is not excluded.\n\nIsrael may be losing the public relations battle when viewed from the lens of the media coverage of the events in Gaza. Yet one can view positively the fact that demonstrators against Israel have aroused widespread resentment for their hooligan-like behavior and antics. A case in point is the chaos on university campuses.\n\nA Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll survey in the United States found that 80% of those polled favor Israel over Hamas. Indeed, many argue that the silent majority in most countries supports Israel.\n\nJewish communities need to cease being reactive and defeatist. The eruption of antisemitism globally is the conflict being internationalized and to avoid being marginalized, Jewish communities need to stand up.\n\nIf Jews wish to demonstrate in Hyde Park London, it should not allow the Metropolitan Police to steer them away if pro-Palestinian demonstrators are present. The brouhaha over Gideon Falter being rebuked by the police for openly wearing a kippah is an example of how to respond.\n\nThere was one massive demonstration in Washington held in November where hundreds of thousands of Jews assembled. Why are there not regular demonstrations in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles where there are large Jewish populations?\n\nMoreover, when Jews have elected to demonstrate they have done so with dignity and an absence of any behavior that could be deemed offensive. Calls for peace and releasing the hostages can be juxtaposed against the calls of \"intifada\" and \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.\"\n\nJewish community leaders need to convey more effectively that freedom of speech and criticism of Israel do not allow for incitement to eradicate Israel and slaughter Jews.\n\nWherever antisemitism occurs such as the cancellation of Jewish artists or events resulting from pressure from the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions crowd, there is a need to employ every means possible to raise awareness that such activities are unacceptable. This pertains to Jews who experience harassment and discrimination. Perhaps it's time that the Jewish communities respond by creating their own registry of corporations, organizations, and prominent individuals who engage in blatant antisemitic activity.\n\nThe tepid response from most universities to the demonstrations, where external forces have been aiding and abetting needs to be tackled from all angles beginning at a government level to supporting Jewish students at the grassroots level.\n\nJewish philanthropy has supported numerous educational institutions and the arts which are hotbeds of anti-Israel and antisemitic activities. Whereas individual donors have withdrawn their support ad hoc, it is time for communal leaders to galvanize in a more concerted manner.\n\nCommunal leaders need to increase their advocacy and build coalitions within societies to combat the Islamist-leftist coalition. In particular, those who adhere to Judeo-Christian values make natural allies.\n\nJews need to remind not only themselves but society at large that they proudly identify as Zionists who stand with Israel and will defend it against the libels that have been launched against it.\n\nFinally, as Jews mark Holocaust Remembrance Day, commemorating the extermination of 6 million Jews in the Holocaust, they need to reinforce the message: Never Again!", "source": {"uri": "themedialine.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Media Line"}, "authors": [{"uri": "romy_leibler@themedialine.org", "name":

Lawrence Franklin was the USAF Reserve Military Attach\u00e9 to the U.S. Embassy in Israel and the U.S. Defense Secretary's Farsi-Speaking Iran Officer and Islamic Terrorism specialist. He holds a PhD is in Asian Studies.\n\nAmerican Jews must now be remembering the gruesome but verifiable wisdom imparted to them by their grandparents: There is no safe place for a Jew.\n\nWhen millions of Jews began to emigrate from the shtetls and ghettos of pre-revolutionary Tsarist Russia and Eastern Europe, a huge portion came to America. They sailed past the Statue of liberty, as did my Irish-Catholic grandparents, on the way to Ellis Island. Many of them settled on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Most were true believers in the clarion call of the Jewish poetess Emma Lazarus: \"Give me your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free.\"\n\nAmerica appeared to be a new Jerusalem where Jews would finally escape the woes of the next pogrom in \"Old Europe.\" Here, they would thrive. When the economy cratered during the Great Depression, Jews were not signaled out as scapegoats. They were not falsely accused of participating in traitorous conspiracies as they were after France lost to the Germans in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871. The nadir of that wave of antisemitism was the French military's dishonor in the Dreyfus Affair. Jews also bore the blame for Germany's loss in World War I, a \"hate-myth\" articulated by the Nazi theme of \"dolchstoss,\" the \"stab in the back.\"\n\nThis pattern of Jew-hatred dates at least as far back as medieval times, when Jews were blamed for the Black Death, a pandemic that may have killed half of the mid-14th century European population. At the same time, parts of Christian Europe ascribed to religious Jew-hatred as an element of doctrinal faith. They ignored the first words of their resurrected redeemer from the cross: \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\" There are still those who ignore the Pontifical embrace of Pope St. John Paul II, who instructed Catholics to revere our \"elder brothers.\"\n\nThe post-World War II decades witnessed the flourishing of Americans Jews, who excelled in every dimension of American life. Their success lulled American Jews into thinking they had finally found respite from centuries of antisemitism. Large numbers of Jews cast aside the \"superstitions\" of the old religion. Many abandoned the sacred values of Judaism. They vitiated the theological and moral message of their tradition, disparaging any belief in the divinely-instituted nature of the Covenant and promise to the chosen tribe.\n\nJews in America strove to assimilate into the dominant profiles of the American republic; first, the Judeo-Christian model and later the more secular strain of contemporary America.\n\nSo, many American Jews, now only culturally Jewish, intermarried; only rarely raising offspring with any religious faith. Jews rose to the top ranks of political power in the new Jerusalem with almost no reference to their Jewish background. Jewish parents pushed their children to adopt American values and seek enrollment in the best schools in the country.\n\nI did not become aware that the Jew-haters were still among us until the late 1990s. Working as an analyst at the Defense Intelligence Agency, I would hear colleagues complain that America was \"being used\" by Israel and its supporters. This attitude involved the old \"dual loyalty\" trope, which holds that Jews in high policy positions were getting the U.S. to \"fight Israel's wars.\"\n\nWhen I became then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's Iran Desk Officer and the U.S. Air Force's Reserve Colonel Attache to our embassy in Israel, these taunts were directed my way. I was warned by colleagues that I was getting too close to the \"Izzis.\" A few even implied that I was a spy for Israel. These charges led to my firing as a Defense Department civilian and military reservist with loss of both pensions as well as forfeiture of my Vietnam Era Veteran's Administration compensation.\n\nNow, Jewish students across our republic are finally realizing what it means to be a Jew; yes, even here in America. Now, Jewish parents must wonder whether Zionist leader Theodor Herzl was correct that a Jew can only be safe in a Jewish nation-state. Perhaps it is true that, even in America, assimilation is folly.\n\nSadly, those Jews who view themselves as \"guests\" in any polity and assert the futility of integration may be correct. I now fear that soon many of our loyal Jewish fellow citizens will urge their children to make Aliyah and emigrate to Israel.\n\nThose responsible for fomenting hatred of Jews and Israel are fools like the bigots of old. History's Jew-haters, whether they be betrayers of Christ's message, purveyors of Quran-inspired Jew-hatred in Arab Muslim states, Soviet ideologues or Islamic terrorist groups are fools. They themselves have inspired millions of Jews to emigrate to Israel, making the Jewish state a powerful engine for democracy and an enlightened boon to humankind.\n\nWhatever comes, Israel is prepared to stand alone. This reality recalls the words of former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, who told the then-young Senator Joe Biden in 1982 of the Senate's threat to cut off aid to Israel: \"Don't threaten us with cutting off aid to give up our principles. We will stand by our principles. We will defend them. And, when necessary, we will die for them, with or without your aid.\"\n\nThe only alternative is for organized American Christianity to mobilize its masses in support of our \"elder brothers.\" They must do so before the American republic becomes the Weimar Republic by failing to defend its Judeo-Christian roots.", "source": {"uri": "jns.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish News

The Bill was passed when university students across the US had risen to condemn Israel's genocide in Gaza. It now goes to the Senate for consideration.\n\nWhen it becomes law, the \"Anti-Semitism Awareness Bill\" would allow the US Federal Department of Education to restrict funding and other resources to campuses perceived as tolerating anti-Semitism.\n\nThe law would mandate government civil rights offices to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA's) definition of anti-Semitism.\n\nBut the definition has also drawn criticism because most of its examples of anti-Semitism involve criticism of Israel, including calling it a \"racist endeavour or a racist project.\"\n\nThe Bill is moving forward at a time when criticism of Israel has been in the spotlight. Protesters at the pro-Palestinian encampments on US university campuses have harshly criticized Israel, with some using language decried as anti-Semitic.\n\nSupporters of the Bill\n\nAccording to the Times of Israel supporters of the Bill say it covers a range of ways in which anti-Semitism manifests today. But opponents say it \"chills\" legitimate criticism of Israel.\n\nOpponents of the IHRA definition in Congress included New York Rep. Jerry Nadler, the House's longest-serving Jewish Democrat. \"Speech that is critical of Israel alone does not constitute unlawful discrimination,\" the Associated Press quoted Nadler as saying.\n\nHowever, Kenneth Marcus, Chairman of the Brandeis Centre for Human Rights and a Department of Education civil rights official under the Trump administration, said that the bill, should it become law, would be a useful tool on campuses given the recent turmoil.\n\n\"Americans for Peace Now\" a dovish pro-Israel group, said in a statement that the bill, should it become law, would be used \"as a cudgel against the millions of Americans, including many Jewish Americans, who object to the Netanyahu government's decisions and actions,\" referring to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's conduct of the war against Hamas since October 2023.\n\nDefinition of Anti-Semitism\n\nOn May 26, 2016, the 31-member states of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), of which the United States is a member, adopted a non-legally binding \"working definition\" of anti-Semitism at its plenary in Bucharest.\n\nThe non-legally binding working definition of anti-Semitism adopted was as follows: \"Anti-Semitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of anti-Semitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.\"\n\nListing the manifestations of anti-Semitism, the definition said that it might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as anti-Semitic.\n\nAnti-Semitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews when things go wrong. It is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits.\"\n\n\"Contemporary examples of anti-Semitism in public life, the media, schools, the workplace, and in the religious sphere could, taking into account the overall context, include, but not limited to:-\n\nCalling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion.\"\n\nJewish conspiracy\n\n\"Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective -- such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions.\"\n\n\"Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews and denying the Holocaust and accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.\"\n\n\"Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations. Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour.\"\n\n\"Applying double standards by requiring of Jews a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation. Using the symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis.\"\n\n\"Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis and holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.\"\n\n\"Criminal acts are anti-Semitic when the targets of attacks, whether they are people or property - such as buildings, schools, places of worship and cemeteries - are selected because they are, or are perceived to be, Jewish or linked to Jews.\"\n\n\"Anti-Semitic discrimination is the denial to Jews of opportunities or services available to others and is illegal in many countries.\"\n\nStudents Movement Against Israel\n\nBut critics warn that IHRA's definition could be used to stifle campus protests against Israel's war in Gaza, which has claimed the lives of over 34,568 Palestinians so far.\n\nIn the University of Texas, at Dallas, at least 17 student protesters were arrested and charged with trespassing after police were called to take down anti-Israel encampments that were established on campus in violation of the school's code of conduct. Encampments are similar to sit-in protests.\n\nIn Florida, among other states, police have dispersed campus rallies with tear gas. Photos showed officers detaining a University of Wisconsin Madison Professor with blood splattered on his forehead, the Washington Post reported.\n\nFour police officers and three sheriff's deputies were injured while trying to shut down illegal camping, according to a spokesperson from the University of Wisconsin at Madison\n\nIn California, masked men of a pro-Israel group, attacked a pro-Palestinian encampment on a Los Angeles campus. Students criticized police for not intervening sooner. Fifteen injuries, including one hospitalization, were reported after police quelled the violence. In Portland State University, students barricaded themselves in a library and spray-painted \"FREE GAZA\" on the wall.\n\nStriking visuals\n\nIn Columbia and the City University in New York, over 300 protesters were arrested. In the last 14 days 1,700 had been taken into custody, the Washington Post said. The striking visuals of officers flooding college campuses have triggered condemnation from labour leaders and left-leaning politicians, the Post added.\n\nPolice have so far arrested over 2,000 protesters at colleges around the country.\n\nStudents demand their schools divest from companies that support Israel's government, such as the arms suppliers. One of the common chants by protesters heard at the University of Michigan was, \"Divulge, divest. We will not stop, we will not rest,\" Al Jazeera said.\n\nOn Thursday, at a pro-Palestinian protest at the University of Mississippi, some shouted racist remarks and one individual can be heard making what sounded like monkey noises at the Black student.\n\n\"Students were calling for an end to genocide. They were met with racism,\" James M Thomas, a sociology professor at the University of Mississippi, wrote on X.\n\nSeveral Republican Congressmen have urged President Biden to call on the National Guard to dismantle encampments. Former President Donald Trump said: \"To every college president, I say: remove the encampments immediately. Vanquish the radicals and take back our campuses for all of the normal students who want a safe place from which to learn.\"\n\nTrump called protesters \"raging lunatics and Hamas sympathizers\" and added: \"Your towns and villages will now be accepting people from Gaza and various other places.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymirror.lk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mirror"}, "authors": [],

The protester's taunt, 'Go back to Poland,' is grotesque", "body": "When it was reported that a demonstrator near Columbia University had loudly suggested that Jews should go back to Poland, I was already there. My wife, son and daughter and I were visiting Holocaust sites in Eastern Europe. My father's family is from Poland and Ukraine, and many of our relatives perished in the Holocaust.\n\nI don't know if any of my ancestors were Zionists although I suspect some of them must have been. The definition of \"Zionist\" that I've always used is a person who believes the Jews deserve a state where they can be safe. That is something I believe. I also believe the Palestinians deserve a state where they can be safe, the Israeli occupation has been a disaster and Benjamin Netanyahu needs to be replaced.\n\nAs for the suggestion that Jews, or more precisely Ashkenazi Jewish Israelis -- those of European heritage -- should book a one-way ticket to Warsaw, I realize it's not a point of view representative of the whole of the protesters on U.S. campuses. Yet it is undeniably a reflection of the \"settler colonialist\" position on Israel, a narrative that has gained traction despite more than half of Israeli Jews being Mizrahi -- that is, from the Middle East. Palestinians and Israelis are two Indigenous peoples occupying the land that is being fought over.\n\nAnd what about Poland? Almost 3 million Jews lived in Poland before World War II. Now the population that self-identifies as Jewish is less than 5,000. It's instructive to remember that most of the Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto, perhaps 300,000 , were taken to Treblinka where they were murdered alongside another 500,000 or so Jews.\n\nTreblinka is now a vast field covered with a massive memorial consisting of hundreds of stones laid side by side, pointing heavenward. I wandered among them and thought about the catastrophe that led to this place and what was now unfolding at universities across America -- the anti-Israel chants, Jewish students' fear of being on campus, the protests and counterprotests creating a climate of menace.\n\nThe same day my family visited Treblinka, another Columbia student, described as a leader of the protests there, was quoted in the New York Times as saying, \"Zionists don't deserve to live.\" He apologized, and I don't want to compare him to Nazis. He and his compatriots are young and with youth comes the right to let your heart dominate your brain. His words, however, wore a swastika.\n\nOf course, what has happened to the Palestinian people since 1948 has been its own catastrophe, of which the war in Gaza is the latest iteration. The number of civilian deaths is appalling, the suffering of the families profound and seemingly endless. It is not hard to understand the anger and heartbreak animating pro-Palestinian encampments, although one wishes more protesters would acknowledge that the Israeli onslaught did not occur in a vacuum, and that Hamas itself has an affinity for dead Palestinians.\n\n\"Go back to Poland\" taunts are grotesque and willfully misinformed. To read about them while in Poland, where a ghost country of murder victims exists alongside the current population, is deeply disorienting. Where a synagogue used to be is now a delicatessen; a ritual bathhouse is a police station; a cemetery a derelict patch of ground or a verdant grove in the woods bereft of gravestones because they were stolen to be used to pave roads. So many Jews died in Poland that you could say that the entire country is a Jewish cemetery. In Poland, Jews are like the Native Americans in America. They are celebrated, sometimes sincerely, but mostly they are erased.\n\nWe visited a town that was nearly 100% Jewish before the war; now not one Jew lives there and there is virtually no indication that Jews ever made it their home. I am by inclination sympathetic to the protesters. I am even inclined to forgive their ahistorical point of view, although it is ironic given that so many of them are being educated at elite institutions. But they must know: Jewish collective trauma, like that of the Palestinians, is undeniable. One shouldn't have to go to places like Treblinka to be reminded of this. Have we learned nothing?\n\nThat the protesters are not all antisemitic is a given. Some will happily take a break from chanting \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\" to inform you that they count Jews among their number. And yet, from their encampments in privileged Los Angeles and Manhattan, they envision a progressive paradise where everyone's wounds are salved and racism a dim memory, but there is no place for Zionists, which for many (once again: not all!) is simply a dog whistle meaning Jews.\n\nGo back to Poland? It is impossible. And the maximalist daydreams of American protesters will not help Palestinians.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The diffuse confrontation is clearly a product of and contributor to deep polarization. The way in which basic issues are understood (such as when the war started, the aims of various actors, and who is threatening to what or whom) reflects preexisting deep divisions. The slogans of some of the protests reflect the sense that the extent of death and destruction in Gaza lends urgency to the matter; their calls have clearly resonated with broader audiences concerned with social justice and global inequalities. Those who charge the protests with antisemitism or support for terrorism have determined that they can use the polarization to unite their base but divide their opponents.\n\nBut that polarization at a national (and sometimes global) level masks two deep developments within specific groups: American Jews, who are deeply fractured, and Palestinians, who are increasingly reliant on international solidarity rather than their own decaying and discredited domestic structures. I can reflect on the first a bit from the inside and the second as a longtime outside observer.\n\nFrom a distance, the university protests might appear to be a confrontation between Palestinians (and their supporters) with Jews on American college campuses. But the dynamics can look a bit different up close. It is not just that many of those involved in supporting the Palestinian cause are Jewish; it is also that the upsurge of activism reflects a more complex set of divisions within the American Jewish community. And indeed, many individual American Jews feel increasing ambivalence about Israeli policy (sometimes edging into ambivalence about Israeli itself) that leaves them feeling confused and torn by the polarized debate.\n\nToday, on one side stands the bulk of the formal leadership of most national Jewish organizations, who came of age as Israel moved to the center of American Jewish identity in the years after the 1967 war. On the other side are many younger Jews who self-identify as progressives and show interest in local and global efforts to promote social justice. The division reflects not only generational but also denominational lines: many Orthodox, for instance, have built strong links not simply to Israel but specifically to the Israeli religious right. The effect of the campus demonstrations and the countereffort to define the demonstrations as antisemitic deepen an already growing division and diminish middle ground among American Jews. The likely result will be an increasing prominence of anti-antisemitism in American Jewish politics, with the implicit message, \"If you are Jewish, be afraid. Be very afraid. Especially if you are young and on a college campus, antisemitism, not assimilation, is the threat.\" For the substantial number of Jews who eschew the sometimes-radical language of the protests but who are simply not afraid and are indeed troubled by Israeli policy, this message risks alienation from the structures of communal life.\n\nIf the campus activism can be seen dividing American Jews, it has a different and somewhat unifying effect among Palestinians watching from thousands of miles away. What is happening on American campuses (and a limited number of European ones) has caught the attention of those in the West Bank and Gaza, who see it as a hopeful sign that the world is not ignoring them. And for some Palestinians it offers an often inchoate but also real alternative to the factional politics that has disillusioned many. In a visit to the West Bank this past summer -- before the Gaza war -- I received the impression that most residents (and almost all younger ones) felt despair and alienation from what seemed to them to be an aged, feckless, and irrelevant leadership. (When I would suggest that the problem might be that \"Palestinians have officials but no leaders,\" I generally received knowing nods and never heard disagreement.) Of course, Hamas offers an alternative of sorts, but even many who observe that the movement has placed Palestine back on the international agenda acknowledge it offers slogans and boldness but no viable strategy.\n\nOver nearly a generation, my research has revealed a gradual but clear trend: Palestinians and their international supporters have left behind the idea of building the structures of a state of Palestine (at least for the present) and instead are turning toward popular mobilization for a less defined goal of liberation from occupation. That should be no surprise, given the failure of the Oslo process of the 1990s and a sense (now two decades old) that Palestinians live in a \"one state reality\" of Israeli control. This shift may be gaining global traction in this environment. The idea that there is a loose network of international activism, and that the world is listening to their plight, can be politically energizing for a rising generation of Palestinians who have generally known only despair for much of their lives. Their challenge has always been to translate informal networks and bursts of imagination and energy into a sustainable movement that can strategize and prioritize.\n\nOn a personal level, I confess a distaste for the kind of politics that emerges from this polarization in the Jewish community, the United States, and the world. As an academic, I find it a bit frustrating to see issues on which I am used to exploring over a chapter or a book reduced quite literally to slogans to be chanted. I prefer quieter discussions that can still occur (if generally behind closed doors). But I am cautiously optimistic that, despite my dismay at the terms of the debate, the effects of this polarizing moment can actually be salutary for the two communities noted above -- American Jews and Palestinians.\n\nWhile most of the rhetoric of the campus demonstrations is shrill and little is attached to any viable program, it is not inherently dangerous (with some notable exceptions). I am far more fearful for the future when I see politicians come to my home campus to protect me from the protests' alleged antisemitism on the same day that their colleagues cite the Bible as holding Jews responsible for killing Jesus, when I hear members of Congress lecture university administrators that \"intifada\" means \"genocide\" while their colleagues appear to call for use of nuclear weapons against Palestinians, execution of every member of Hamas, and leaving Gaza looking like Berlin and Tokyo (where hundreds of thousands were killed in the last year of World War II).\n\nThe campus demonstrations polarize society today, but they may force American Jewish leaders to find an approach that does not drive so much of the younger generation (and the occasional oldster) away. The Palestinian struggle -- played out in international lawfare, partisan sloganeering, and noisy, even obnoxious, but still peaceful campus demonstrations -- can be a positive step, if only it can be forged into an alternative to the current slaughter in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "carnegieendowment.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Carnegie Endowment for International Peace"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nathan_j_brown@carnegieendowment.org", "name": "Nathan J.

The state chairman of the PDP, Chidi Dike, said this on Sunday while speaking to newsmen in Owerri. He was reacting to the last Friday judgment of the Imo governorship tribunal that affirmed Governor Hope Uzodimma of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, as the governor of the state. According to the opposition party, the last tribunal judgment did not reflect the facts as presented by the PDP to the court for that reason they would head to the appeal court. \"From every indication, the ruling of the tribunal did not reflect the true facts presented before the tribunal by our legal luminaries. The fact of the matter is that the party and its candidate in the November 11 governorship election, Distinguish Senator Samuel Nnaemeka Anyanwu won the election which facts were presented to the tribunal. While rejecting the ruling, this does not vitiate our confidence in the judiciary and its ability to correct the lopsided view of the Judges that sat in Abuja. \u201cWe state in unmistakable terms that the population of Imo electorates rejected the candidate of the APC and placed their confidence in the PDP following the abysmal performance of the APC in Imo State. The Peace-loving people of Imo State had before the poll expressed their tiredness and loss of confidence in the Governance of APC and yearned for a change which they trooped out en masse in November to further elucidate, but their efforts were thwarted by INEC and their officials. \u201cHowever, we restate our confidence tha these anomalies of the tribunal will be corrected. PDP is a constitutional party and we have unflinching confidence in the constitution of Nigeria and its interpreters in the higher echelon of the Judiciary. \u201cLet me at this juncture appreciate our party members across the state. What you have demonstrated in the 24 hours following the tribunal judgement is indeed a great show of solidarity and absolute loyalty. Your calls and text messages are hereby acknowledged and I pledge in my honour that I and the Caretaker Committee Members will not take it for granted. \u201cWe will not fail you. While assuring you that your mandate and that of the Imo people will be recovered. I want to say again that we are not going to rest on our oars. We urge you to remain resolute as the Court of Appeal will definitely serve us Justice,\u201d he said.", "summary": "<img width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PDP.jpeg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PDP.jpeg 1280w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PDP-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PDP-1024x576.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /><p>The Imo State leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has said the appeal court will serve them justice in the case of the legal battle surrounding the November 2023 governorship election.

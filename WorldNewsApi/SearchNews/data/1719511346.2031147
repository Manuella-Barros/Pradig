McConachie said hospice residents often have less than three months of life expectancy. \u201cWe make sure their final days are lived with dignity and we provide all-encompassing care in order to support them and their families,\u201d McConachie said. \u201cFamily can go back to being family. McConachie has first-hand experience with the hospice. Her mother was a resident. \u201cI didn\u2019t want my mom to go, I thought we could take care of her at home,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom was a nurse and she suggested the hospice . . . it was the best decision we made. I just fell in love with it.\u201d", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.owensoundsuntimes.com/news/local-news/community-rallies-around-hike-for-hospice-at-harrison-park", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/nexus/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hikeforhospice.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 17:05:09", "author": "Greg Cowan", "authors": ["Greg Cowan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": 0.177}

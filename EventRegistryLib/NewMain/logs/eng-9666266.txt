So, difficult to know exactly what was on his mind.\"\n\nKirby, asked about a behind-the-scenes efforts to get an apology from Netanyahu over the video, also said, \"I think we've made it abundantly clear to our Israeli counterparts from various vehicles our deep disappointment in the statements expressed in that video and our concerns over the accuracy in the statements made.\"\n\nDespite the growing public tensions, officials from both nations met in Washington on Thursday to discuss the ongoing war. Kirby confirmed that national security adviser Jake Sullivan would still be meeting with high-level Israeli officials coming to the White House.\n\n\"Jake [Sullivan] will be meeting today with his counterpart,\" Kirby said, referring to Tzachi Hanegbi, the head of Israel's National Security Council. He also said that Ron Dermer, Israeli's Minister of Strategic Affairs, would be in the session.\n\n\"It'll be a wide-ranging discussion, I think you can imagine, about everything that's going on with the Gaza war with our support to Israel, with our efforts to get a better sense of how they're continuing to prosecute operations against Hamas, as well as continuing to talk about the importance of closing on this deal,\" Kirby said ahead of the meeting.\n\nBiden's team was enraged and frustrated by Netanyahu's video, a U.S. official told ABC News on Wednesday, adding that U.S. officials have made clear to the Israelis that Netanyahu's video is inaccurate and out of line.\n\nThe meeting comes after the U.S. canceled another meeting between American and Israeli officials to discuss Iran in response to the Netanyahu video, officials confirmed to ABC News.\n\nBut the White House pushed back on claims that a high-level U.S.-Israel meeting on Iran scheduled for this Thursday was canceled specifically because of the video. It instead pointed to scheduling issues as the reason for the cancellation of the meeting. The White House also insists that the meeting will be rescheduled.\n\nAt the State Department Thursday, spokesperson Matt Miller announced that Blinken would meet with Dermer and Hanegbi Thursday afternoon.\n\nMiller said that during the meeting, the officials would discuss \"our ongoing work to try to reach a ceasefire that will secure the release of all hostages\" as well as the situation in north of Israel along the country's border with Lebanon, as well as ongoing work to \"get humanitarian assistance into Gaza and work that needs to be done to accelerate and improve that process.\"",

I said I deeply appreciate the support the US has given Israel from the beginning of the war. But I also said something else.\" He continued, \"I said it is inconceivable that in the past few months, the administration has been withholding weapons and ammunition to Israel.\"\n\nThe Biden administration's response has been a mixture of anger and confusion. The White House suspended one Iran strategic dialog summit between US and Israeli officials, but business between Washington and Tel Aviv remains largely unchanged. High-level meetings between Israel and US officials are expected in the coming days.\n\nSeveral US officials have said they are perplexed by Netanyahu's remarks because US weapons are flowing to Israel at the normal pace. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters, \"We genuinely do not know what he's talking about.\"\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the video was \"disappointing and vexing.\" \"It's hard to know what went through him, the video was puzzling to say the least,\" he stated.\n\nNetanyahu appears to have taken the White House's mild response as a personal attack. \"I am ready to suffer personal attacks provided that Israel receives from the US the ammunition it needs in the war for its existence,\" he posted on X on Thursday. It is unclear what personal attack was made against him.\n\nA senior Israeli official said the strain that Netanyahu's video put on the Washington-Tel Aviv relationship could have been avoided. \"Netanyahu made the decision against the opinion of the advisers and ministers with whom he consulted.\" The official added the remarks caused \"great outrage in the Biden administration.\"\n\nThe PM was reported to have discussed the issue with National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, both members of his Likud party, along with other ministers.", "source": {"uri": "news.antiwar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News From Antiwar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzachi_Hanegbi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tzachi Hanegbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Dermer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron Dermer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likud", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Likud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://news.antiwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/awc_logo_for-circle-profile_600sq-01.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666266", "eventUri": "eng-9666266", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY) both acquiesced to the sale last week in response to pressure from Biden administration officials.\n\n\"On the F-15s, the only other thing I'd add is that these would be slated to be delivered in, like, 2029, if they're approved,\" Kirby said on Thursday. \"And that approval process is ongoing. [It is] not related at all to the current conflict,\" he added.\n\nThe meetings also come as US officials aim to coordinate with top Israeli leaders on contingency plans in case Iran should pursue a nuclear weapon. US intelligence assesses Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has not issued any policy decision to obtain a nuclear weapon.\n\nBut Iran's government has continued to enrich uranium at varying speeds since the United States unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 multinational nuclear accord with Tehran. The deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, was abandoned by then-President Donald Trump in 2018.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN's watchdog agency on nuclear energy, reported last week that Iran planned to install additional advanced centrifuges in response to recent censure for its nuclear advances.", "source": {"uri": "al-monitor.com",

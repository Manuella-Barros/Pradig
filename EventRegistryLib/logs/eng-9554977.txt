Thomas Massie over record on Israel", "body": "A national group plans to spend big on television ads aimed at a Kentucky congressman because of his perceived anti-Israel views.\n\nThe United Democracy Project will spend about $300,000 to buy ads on Fox affiliates criticizing Republican Rep. Thomas Massie's voting record on measures supporting Israel, said project spokesperson Patrick Dorton.\n\n\"We are not playing in the primary, but we are trying to shine a light on the radical anti-Israel record of Tom Massie,\" Dorton said. \"We want every single voter in the state of Kentucky to know about his anti-Israel actions.\"\n\n\"Republicans are trying to help Israel, but one Republican is standing in the way,\" the ad states, adding Massie voted against Israel with \"anti-Israel radicals\" 15 times in April.\n\nThe United Democracy Project is an affiliate of AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a major pro-Israel lobbying group\n\nMassie was elected to his seat in 2012 and is being challenged by fellow Republicans Eric Deters and Michael McGinnis in the May 21 primary.\n\nMassie said in a statement to The Courier Journal he believes AIPAC is trying to \"tilt the outcome of the election\" toward Deters by running the ads close to the upcoming primary. He also raised the question if House Speaker Mike Johnson was involved with the ads.\n\n\"This week in our GOP conference meeting, as members groused about blowback from the latest anti-antisemitism resolution, Speaker Johnson pledged to call his contacts at Jewish/Israel groups if they mustered opposition to any member of our conference,\" Massie said. \"This, and the timing of the ad announcement, does raise the question of whether the ads were suggested by or sanctioned by Speaker Johnson.\"\n\n\"I am often the lone Republican for freedom of speech, against foreign aid, and opposed to wars in the Middle East,\" Massie also said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. He encouraged people to donate to his campaign. Another post said his vote in favor of ousting House Speaker Mike Johnson this week drove the ad buy.\n\nThis is not the first time the groups have blasted Massie. In the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, AIPAC criticized Massie for voting against a House resolution in support of the country.\n\nHe has, however, condemned the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nIn general, Massie is a staunch opponent of U.S. foreign aid. His opposition to an aid package that included funds for Ukraine and Israel led him to co-sponsor this week's failed resolution to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson. Massie said Congress should prioritize U.S.-Mexico border security instead.\n\nWhat is the United Democracy Project?\n\nThe United Democracy Project describes itself as an organization of Americans of all parties who are \"united in the belief that America's partnership with our democratic ally Israel benefits both countries.\"\n\nThe United Democracy Project spent over $1.5 million to oppose U.S. Rep. John Hostettler in the Indiana primary this week, according to campaign finance tracking website Open Secrets. Republican Hostettler lost to Indiana state Sen. Mark Messmer this week.\n\nThe United Democracy Project has also funded efforts to unseat other candidates it views as anti-Israel, such as California Democrat Dave Min, and put its money behind pro-Israel candidates like Sarah Elfreth of Maryland.\n\nThe United Democracy Project has raised over $49 million since the start of 2023 and had around $33 million on hand at the end of March, according to Open Secrets.\n\nA spokesperson for Massie did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "cincinnati.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cincinnati"},

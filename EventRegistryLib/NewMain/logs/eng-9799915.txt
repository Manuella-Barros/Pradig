Darla Rodgers was especially devastated after hearing that \"The Predator\" and \"The Newsroom\" star blabbed in an interview about their sex practices, as Munn explained how she and the then-Green Bay Packers quarterback didn't have sex on game days.\n\n\"Given her devout religious views, Aaron's mother disapproved of premarital sex and was opposed to her middle child sharing a hotel room with his girlfriend even as an NFL player,\" wrote O'Connor, an author and New York Post sports columnist.\n\n\"Darla did not appreciate how Munn joked about oral sex in an interview or how she publicly talked about her sex life with Aaron just before that loss at Buffalo,\" O'Connor also wrote.\n\nThe Daily Mail said the interview in question appeared to be Munn talking to Andy Cohen on his \"Watch What Happens Live\" show in December 2014. Cohen had asked Munn if she and Rodgers had sex on game days.\n\nMunn replied: \"No, we don't. Not on game days. There's not a rule, but it just doesn't happen because there are other things to focus on.\"\n\nHowever, Munn said they would sometimes have sex after a Packers game, the Daily Mail reported. \"It depends on how late the game is,\" she said. \"I try to have sex as much as I can.\"\n\nA source told O'Connor that Munn was \"saying all that (expletive) and it pissed off Darla, really pissed her off.\"\n\nEd and Darla Rodgers also reportedly objected to another interview that Munn did with Cohen, when she claimed that she tried to encourage her boyfriend to repair his relationship with his parents, O'Connor reported. According to O'Connor, Ed Rodgers said: \"It's a lie.\"\n\nTensions also escalated after Munn reportedly told Rodgers that she didn't want them to see his parents after a game in Tampa, even though his parents would be traveling to Florida to go to Disney World, according to O'Connor's book.\n\nUpon hearing this, Ed and Darla Rodgers said they had been attending their son's games since he was a child and didn't need Munn's permission to continue to do so, according to the book. Ed Rodgers reportedly told Munn: \"You haven't been on the scene very long. You're just his girlfriend. We're his parents.\"\n\nThe parents were subsequently dismayed that they never received a phone call from their son, apologizing for his girlfriend's actions, according to the book. They began to believe that Munn was the \"chief culprit in the family division.\"\n\nBut Rodgers rejected his parents' view of Munn, saying in O'Connor's book that she had \"nothing to do\" with the tensions between them. He also questioned his parents' reasons for talking about the estrangement, asserting, \"There's nothing they can say other than make up stories, but look at the facts.\"\n\nRodgers' feud with his family became public knowledge in the spring of 2016, courtesy of Aaron's brother, Jordan Rodgers, when he was a contestant on \"The Bachelorette.\" While courting JoJo Fletcher, Jordan Rodgers revealed that he's close to his oldest brother Luke, but that Aaron Rodgers is estranged from the rest of the family.\n\nA lengthy 2022 profile of Rodgers by ESPN echoed certain points made in O'Connor's book about the family rift. The ESPN story said that Rodgers began to pull away from what he considered \"the dogmatic religious views of his family\" when he was studying and playing football at Butte Community College, before transferring to UC Berkeley to play for the Golden Bears.\n\nBut it's also been reported that Rodgers started to pull away from his family after he led the Packers to a Super Bowl win in 2011. Some reports said that Jordan Rodgers and the rest of the family were jealous of Aaron's NFL fame and success.\n\nO'Connor's book also reported that Rodgers felt that his generosity towards his parents was being \"taken for granted,\" an idea that Munn bolstered, reportedly telling her boyfriend that he shouldn't let his family \"do any fame and fortune chasing through him.\"\n\nAccording to the book, Rodgers has never patched things up with his parents, even after he and Munn broke up in 2017. She subsequently began a relationship with comedian John Mulaney, with whom she had a son, Malcolm, in 2021. Munn and Mulaney tied the knot last month, after the actor went public with news that she had endured a harrowing year of surgery and treatment for breast cancer.\n\nRodgers' personal and professional life also has been tumultuous in recent years. He dated retired race car driver Danica Patrick from 2018 to 2020 but broke things off during the COVID-19 lockdown and became secretly engaged to Shailene Woodley, which the \"Divergent\" actor revealed in a 2021 interview with Jimmy Fallon.\n\nHowever, Rodgers and Woodley called off their engagement the following year, even as the quarterback won two back-to-back NFL MVP awards. The quarterback also emerged as a divisive figure American culture, accused of being a \"crackpot\" and \"narcissistic diva\" for spouting conspiracy theories and controversial views on COVID-19 vaccines. He also left the Green Pay Packers in 2023 to play for the New York Jets but was sidelined for the entire season after suffering an Achilles tendon rupture in the first game.", "source": {"uri":

But however the friction came about, the ice between the quarterback and his father began to thaw at the 2023 American Century Championship golf tournament near Lake Tahoe, Nevada.\n\nAccording to Ian O'Connor's 'Out of the Darkness: The Mystery of Aaron Rodgers,' it was there that Ed approached his estranged son to begin the healing process.\n\nThe book, which comes out on August 20, explains that the four-time NFL MVP found his father in the crowd while the quarterback was searching for a bathroom. But despite the friction between the two, Aaron decided against snubbing the man who taught him to play football.\n\nRodgers was playing at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada in 2023 when he ran into Ed\n\nAaron Rodgers' father Ed (left), brother Jordan (center) and brother Luke (right)\n\nRead More Rodgers trolls critics\n\n'I could do a lot of things,' Rodgers is quoted as saying in the book.

Rodgers hadn't really spoken to his family since the holiday season of 2014, but that changed last year when he had a secret meeting with his dad, Ed.\n\nAccording to O'Connor, Ed decided to make the trip to Lake Tahoe in July 2023 to watch his son play in the American Century Championship golf tournament. Aaron didn't know his dad was going to be there, but once he spotted him, he decided it was time to finally break the ice in a move that came less than three months after Aaron was traded to the Jets.\n\n\"I could do a lot of things,\" the 40-year-old said of the moment, via the New York Post. \"But I just thought, 'What's best in this moment, and what kind of gift could I give him?' Because I do love him. I don't have animosity toward him, even with all the stuff that's been said and done.\"\n\nThe Rodgers family feud went public in July 2016 when Aaron's brother, Jordan, was a contestant on \"The Bachelorette.\" While Jordan was courting his future wife, Jo Jo Fletcher, he revealed that everyone in the family is currently estranged from Aaron.\n\nOver the years, the Jets QB hasn't offered very many details about the rift, but the book suggests that Aaron's former girlfriend, Olivia Munn, may have played a role in the rift, something Aaron and Munn both deny. According to the book, Ed and Darla Rodgers weren't thrilled that Munn had been publicly sharing details about her sex life with Aaron.\n\n\"Given her devout religious views, Aaron's mother disapproved of premarital sex and was opposed to her middle child sharing a hotel room with his girlfriend even as an NFL player,\" O'Connor wrote, via the Daily Mail.\n\nWhatever the reason was for the split, Aaron's meeting with his father in Lake Tahoe opened the door for more communication. Less than two months after the meeting, both of Rodgers' parents were in attendance -- with Aaron's knowledge -- for his first game with the Jets.\n\nUnfortunately, that game ended in disaster for Aaron after he tore his Achilles on the fourth play from scrimmage.\n\n\"It was shocking, honestly, so bizarre,\" Ed Rodgers said of the reaction in the stadium to the injury. \"It took the wind out of the whole stadium. The people around us didn't know who we were, but nobody said anything negative like, 'This is what happens with an older quarterback.' It was, 'Oh no. Oh no. Tell me it's not true.' ... It literally happened right across from us.\"\n\nAaron didn't meet up with his parents after the game, but it sounds like he's open to spending more time with his dad.\n\n\"I would like a relationship with my dad for sure,\" Aaron told O'Connor.\n\nThe book, which will be released on Aug. 20, is expected to reveal several new details about both Rodgers' football life and personal life.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_breech@cbssports.com", "name": "John Breech", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Day_O'Connor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sandra Day O'Connor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Century_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Century Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Munn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olivia Munn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tahoe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lake Tahoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_and_holiday_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christmas and holiday season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bachelorette_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Bachelorette (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Achilles tendon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/06/12/54981355-020e-40cf-b14a-2788377e4fca/thumbnail/1200x675/1c71d8e72b5fb69ade07b009f7c8e68f/getty-aaron-rodgers-jets.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799915", "eventUri": "eng-9799915", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-20", "textStart": 3005, "textEnd": 3012}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-07-", "textStart": 1220, "textEnd": 1229}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Of course, Rodgers' parents, Ed and Darla, are steadfast Christians and did not like that their son was having premarital sex.\n\nIn an excerpt from the book published by The Daily Mail, Darla Rodgers took major offense to Munn's comments.\n\n\"Given her devout religious views, Aaron's mother disapproved of premarital sex and was opposed to her middle child sharing a hotel room with his girlfriend even as an NFL player.\"\n\nAdditionally, it has now been reported that Munn got into an argument with Rodgers' parents about them wanting to attend one of his games in Tampa Bay. She had made it very clear that they were not welcome.\n\n\"Ed and Darla explained that they had been attending Aaron's games since he was a kid and did not need her permission to continue to do so.\"\n\nEd Rodgers, Aaron's father, reportedly had strong words for Munn following the situation with the game in Tampa Bay.\n\n\"You haven't been on the scene very long. You're just his girlfriend. We're his parents.\"\n\nThose comments did not sit very well with Rodgers, who responded to his family with an email that simply stated, \"Don't attack the woman I love.\"\n\nWhile even more details will be revealed in the book, it's a very sad situation. Seeing people disconnected from their families is never an easy thing to see. Rodgers and his family were very close leading up to the blowup point.\n\nAs is the case with every situation, the truth lies somewhere in the middle between both sides.\n\nThere were likely mistakes and things done and said on both sides. Hopefully, one day, Rodgers and his parents can set the beef aside and make things right with each other.\n\nIn the meantime, Rodgers is gearing up for the 2024 NFL season with the Jets. He is making his way back from a torn Achilles and will look to help lead his team to a Super Bowl.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Munn", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olivia Munn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcedes_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcedes Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Achilles tendon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4612,h_2594,x_0,y_171/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/jets_country/01j4r0j3cty88snwv44m.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799915", "eventUri": "eng-9799915", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

The latest piece delves into his well-publicized family feud.\n\nVia The Daily Mail, O'Connor's Out of the Darkness: The Mystery of Aaron Rodgers explores the rift that arose between Rodgers and his parents.\n\nThe book pins the blame on actress Olivia Munn, who spoke publicly about their sex life in 2014. \"Given her devout religious views, Aaron's mother disapproved of premarital sex and was opposed to her middle child sharing a hotel room with his girlfriend even as an NFL player,\" O'Connor writes.\n\nThings went downhill from there, with Ed and Darla Rodgers eventually \"sent to the Island,\" which is apparently the place to which Rodgers exiles those with whom he has had a falling out.\n\nAlong the way, Munn reportedly sent a Christmas gift for Aaron back to Ed and Darla unopened.

It was sparked by Rodgers spotting Ed in the crowd at the American Century Championship golf tournament at Lake Tahoe. Rodgers considered avoiding his father, but decided in the moment to mend fences.\n\n\"I could do a lot of things,\" Rodgers told O'Conner. \"But I just thought, 'What's best in this moment, and what kind of gift could I give him?' Because I do love him. I don't have animosity toward him, even with all the stuff that's been said and done.\"\n\nThat's the best news from all of this. It had been known for years that Rodgers and his parents had become estranged. It's great that they found a way to mend fences. (Assuming that the fences remain mended.)\n\nRegardless, life is short, and family is everything.

You're just his girlfriend.

The 40-year-old quarterback previously accused his family -- including parents Ed and Darla Rodgers -- of exploiting him.\n\nA new book, \"Out of the Darkness,\" chronicling the oft-controversial athlete, revealed that Rodgers' relationship with his family sharply declined after the QB started dating actress Olivia Munn in 2014.\n\nAuthor Ian O'Connor writes in his book that Munn was frequently in Rodgers' ear concerning his relationship with his 'devoutly' Christian father and mother.\n\nThe author also wrote that Munn's gaudy mentions of her sex life with Rodgers during public interviews shocked the family, leading to a greater rift.\n\n\"Given her devout religious views, Aaron's mother disapproved of premarital sex,\" O'Connor writes in his book, \"and was opposed to her middle child sharing a hotel room with his girlfriend even as an NFL player.\n\n'Darla did not appreciate how Munn joked about oral sex in an interview or how she publicly talked about her sex life with Aaron just before that loss at Buffalo.\"\n\nNews of Rodgers' family divide appeared in 2016, with a growing tension bubbling between Rodgers, his parents and his brothers.\n\nThe family issues hit a peak in 2017 after Munn allegedly convinced Rodgers to avoid seeing his parents during a visit to Tampa Bay. Later that year, Munn broke off the relationship with Aaron.\n\nRodgers was visiting TB to face off against the Buccaneers and Rodgers' parents had plans to see him afterward.\n\nMunn prohibited Rodgers' parents from seeing him, which inspired a sobering line from his father, Ed.\n\n\"You haven't been on the scene very long. You're just his girlfriend. We're his parents,\" Ed said about the actress. This seemingly infuriated Rodgers, who sent an e-mail out to his family that read, \"Don't attack the woman I love.\"\n\nOn a different occasion, Rodgers sent back a Christmas gift from his parents following Munn's advice. The gift apparently arrived back at the Rodgers' family home during Ed Rodgers' birthday, and they mistook it as a gift for his dad. When they realized that Rodgers had returned his Christmas present, the disagreement worsened.\n\nRodgers's dating life became just as big a topic as his family strains. The journeyman boyfriend previously dated figures like Danica Patrick, actress Shailene Woodley and (who can forget) witch / shaman Blu of Earth. Rodgers' most recent flame was Mallory Edens, daughter of Milwaukee Bucks owner Wes Edens. The quarterback and 27-year-old Edens were rumored to be in a 'casual relationship in 2023.\n\nJordan Rodgers, one of Aaron's two brothers, considers the Jets QB 'estranged' from the family, as noted during a television appearance on \"The Bachelorette.\"\n\n\"It's just the way he's chosen to do life,\" Jordan previously stated. \"I chose to stay close with my family and my parents and my brother [Luke].\n\n\"It's something we don't really like to talk about a whole lot,\" Jordan Rodgers added. \"It pains both of us like, not to have that relationship [with Aaron] -- we miss our brother. I trust that God brings things full circle and that everything would just get back to us being a family.\"\n\nThe ordeal has been brutal for a big name like Rodgers.

Rodgers hadn't really spoken to his family since the holiday season of 2014, but that changed last year when he had a secret meeting with his dad, Ed.\n\nAccording to O'Connor, Ed decided to make the trip to Lake Tahoe in July 2023 to watch his son play in the American Century Championship golf tournament. Aaron didn't know his dad was going to be there, but once he spotted him, he decided it was time to finally break the ice in a move that came less than three months after Aaron was traded to the Jets.\n\n\"I could do a lot of things,\" the 40-year-old said of the moment, via the New York Post. \"But I just thought, 'What's best in this moment, and what kind of gift could I give him?' Because I do love him. I don't have animosity toward him, even with all the stuff that's been said and done.\"\n\nThe Rodgers family feud went public in July 2016 when Aaron's brother, Jordan, was a contestant on \"The Bachelorette.\" While Jordan was courting his future wife, Jo Jo Fletcher, he revealed that everyone in the family is currently estranged from Aaron.\n\nOver the years, the Jets QB hasn't offered very many details about the rift, but the book suggests that Aaron's former girlfriend, Olivia Munn, may have played a role in the rift, something the Aaron and Munn both deny.\n\nWhatever the reason was for the split, Aaron's meeting with his father in Lake Tahoe opened the door for more communication. Less than two months after the meeting, both of Rodgers' parents were in attendance -- with Aaron's knowledge -- for his first game with the Jets.\n\nUnfortunately, that game ended in disaster for Aaron after he tore his Achilles on the fourth play from scrimmage.\n\n\"It was shocking, honestly, so bizarre,\" Ed Rodgers said of the reaction in the stadium to the injury. \"It took the wind out of the whole stadium. The people around us didn't know who we were, but nobody said anything negative like, 'This is what happens with an older quarterback.' It was, 'Oh no. Oh no. Tell me it's not true.' ... It literally happened right across from us.\"\n\nAaron didn't meet up with his parents after the game, but it sounds like he's open to spending more time with his dad.\n\n\"I would like a relationship with my dad for sure,\" Aaron told O'Connor.\n\nThe book, which will be released on Aug. 20, is expected to reveal several new details about both Rodgers' football life and personal life.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_breech@cbssports.com", "name": "John Breech", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Day_O'Connor", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sandra Day O'Connor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Century_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Century Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tahoe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lake Tahoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_and_holiday_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christmas and holiday season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bachelorette_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Bachelorette (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Munn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olivia Munn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Achilles tendon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/06/12/54981355-020e-40cf-b14a-2788377e4fca/thumbnail/1200x675/1c71d8e72b5fb69ade07b009f7c8e68f/getty-aaron-rodgers-jets.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799915", "eventUri": "eng-9799915", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-20", "textStart": 2655, "textEnd": 2662}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-07-", "textStart": 1220, "textEnd": 1229}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

After all, he recently saw his father at the American Century Championship at Lake Tahoe.\n\nRodgers opened up about his relationship with his father in a biography titled \"Out of the Darkness: The Mystery of Aaron Rodgers.\"\n\nAccording to author Ian O'Connor, that meeting at the American Century Championship was the first interaction Rodgers had with his father since the 2014 season.\n\nRodgers, a four-time MVP, thought about avoiding his father on the course. And yet, he ultimately decided to make things right.\n\n\"I could do a lot of things,\" Rodgers said in the book, via the New York Post. \"But I just thought, 'What's best in this moment, and what kind of gift could I give him?' Because I do love him. I don't have animosity toward him, even with all the stuff that's been said and done.\"\n\nAs you'd imagine, this was an emotional moment for Rodgers' father. He went roughly a decade without having constant contact with his son.\n\n\"It had been so long since we even looked at each other,\" Ed Rodgers said. \"I just kind of froze.\"\n\nRodgers told O'Connor that it was a \"special moment\" between him and his father. He also told his caddie for the tournament, Jordan Russell, that it was an interaction that \"needed to happen.\"\n\nHopefully, Rodgers and his family work out their differences while they still can.\n\nRelated: Aaron Rodgers Furious With Teammate At Jets Practice Monday", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_rosvoglou@postandcourier.com", "name": "Chris Rosvoglou", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Century_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Century Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tahoe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lake Tahoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Day_O'Connor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sandra Day O'Connor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799915", "eventUri": "eng-9799915", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The attacker, initially misreported as an immigrant, was later identified as a UK-born individual of Rwandan descent, a fact that intensified public outrage and led to widespread riots.\n\nRick Munn, reporting from Ireland, has critically analyzed the aftermath of the violence and the ensuing government response, shedding light on what he describes as a \"two-tier\" justice system. His observations underscore a troubling disparity in how the UK handles criminal acts and public disturbances based on their context and perpetrators.\n\nMunn noted the government's aggressive stance in the wake of the riots: \"The British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has been clear in his support for law enforcement, pledging increased police presence and rapid legal action against those involved in the violence.\"\n\nMunn highlighted that authorities have prioritized early arrests and swift court appearances to demonstrate a zero-tolerance policy for the unrest. \"Starmer has promised that the full force of the law will be applied, emphasizing that 'whatever the apparel motivation, this is not protest -- it is pure violence,'\" Munn quoted, emphasizing the government's firm stance.\n\nDespite these measures, Munn raised serious concerns about perceived inconsistencies in the enforcement of justice. He criticized the differential treatment of various groups, noting that \"the handling of violence and protests has displayed a clear two-tier system.\" This observation reflects a broader sentiment that some individuals and groups face harsher repercussions than others, depending on the nature of their actions and backgrounds.\n\nMunn provided a striking example of this discrepancy: \"Recently, footage surfaced of a police officer at Manchester Airport using excessive force on suspects who had previously assaulted officers. Despite the severity of the incident, the individuals involved were released on bail.\" This situation contrasts sharply with the treatment of individuals involved in recent riots, who, according to Munn, are being remanded in custody and face more stringent legal scrutiny. \"The contrast is stark -- those accused of violence in the riots are held in custody, while others involved in violent altercations with the police face comparatively lenient treatment,\" Munn explained.\n\nThis perceived imbalance has fueled criticism and frustration among the public. Munn pointed out that social media has amplified concerns about this inequity, with hashtags like \"#TwoTierKeir\" gaining traction as people voice their frustrations with the justice system. \"The hashtag reflects a growing discontent with what many see as a biased application of the law,\" Munn noted.\n\n\"The ongoing unrest and the government's response underscore a deepening division within the UK's approach to law and order,\" he said. The perceived favoritism and unequal treatment of different groups exacerbate public dissatisfaction and undermine trust in the legal system.\n\nFor more context, watch the entire segment featuring Rick Munn:", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_tolerance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zero tolerance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police brutality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hashtag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f397.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799915", "eventUri": "eng-9799915", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Because I do love him. I don't have animosity toward him, even with all the stuff that's been said and done.\"\n\nAfter temporarily losing sight of his middle child from the gallery ropes, Ed Rodgers turned around to find his son looking right at him from less than 20 feet away. They were suddenly alone in a clearing.\n\n\"It had been so long since we even looked at each other,\" Ed Rodgers said. \"I just kind of froze.\"\n\nAccording to the book, Aaron broke the ice by saying, \"Hi Pops,\" and walked toward his dad. The two men embraced.\n\nEd Rodgers said his tears were flowing after his son returned to the course to complete his round in the celebrity tournament. Ed said he had been dreaming of this embrace for years.\n\n\"It was amazing,\" Ed said in the book.\n\nAfter finishing his round, Aaron told his caddie and longtime friend Jordan Russell, \"I think that was what needed to happen.\"\n\n\"That was a special moment,\" Aaron later told O'Connor.\n\nWith the quarterback's knowledge, Ed and Darla attended their son's Jets debut against Buffalo on the 9/11 anniversary last year.\n\nEd and Darla had continued attending occasional Packers games even after Aaron stopped communicating with them while he was dating actress Olivia Munn, who, the parents believed, had a primary role in her boyfriend's choice to cut off his family.\n\n(Aaron and Munn both denied this.)\n\nEd and Darla were sitting anonymously among Jets fans near the 25-yard line -- about 30 rows up from the field -- when their son suffered his season-ending Achilles injury on the Jets' fourth offensive snap.\n\n\"It was shocking, honestly, so bizarre,\" Ed Rodgers said. \"It took the wind out of the whole stadium. The people around us didn't know who we were, but nobody said anything negative like, 'This is what happens with an older quarterback.' It was, 'Oh no. Oh no. Tell me it's not true.' ...It literally happened right across from us.\"\n\nEd and Darla did not see their son after the game, or at any point during his recovery. But early in the offseason Aaron told the author that the road to reconciliation likely ran through his father.\n\n\"It's just timing, just timing,\" Aaron said. \"Every time I think it's getting closer some weird things happen.

And today, we're lifting up the Hooters girls, because tickets for the Miss Hooters International pageant went on sale this morning and who the hell would OutKick be to not support that?\n\nI won't stand for it. Save Hooters! Buy, buy, buy!! And hey! Maybe you'll see the famous Hooters Twins in Fort Worth?\n\nI can't get enough of this Aaron Rodgers book\n\nHappy National Twins Day! Can't believe I missed that. To be fair, I think Amber was teaching class that day, so I should get somewhat of a pass.\n\nOh well. I'm making amends today. Can't wait to see this competition unfold in a few weeks. I'm sure Joe will be on that beat as always, but we'll be here at Nightcaps to pick up the pieces he missed.\n\nOK, let's get down to the nitty-gritty of today's class. This Aaron Rodgers guy is just an unbelievable #content gift. He just never, ever stops.\n\nOh, it's Week 1 of the preseason? Perfect! Let's go ahead and start releasing damning excerpts from my tell-all biography!\n\nLet's check in with Jameis Winston, the true Browns' QB1\n\nFrom the Daily Mail (and Ian's book!):\n\nAaron Rodgers's parents blamed his then girlfriend Olivia Munn for their son cutting off contact with them for nine years, a new biography about the football superstar reveals.\n\nEd and Darla Rodgers felt that the actress was the 'chief culprit' behind their family discord which began in 2014 when she began dating their second son, according to 'Out of the Darkness: The Mystery of Aaron Rodgers', by sports journalist Ian O'Connor.\n\nDarla, a devout Christian, was mortified that Munn, now 44, was having sex with Rodgers, 40, before marriage. And she was even more aghast when Munn revealed in interviews about how they didn't do it on game days. ...\n\n'Darla did not appreciate how Munn joked about oral sex in an interview or how she publicly talked about her sex life with Aaron.' ...\n\nThe interview in question appeared to be Munn talking on 'Watch What Happens Live' in December 2014 where host Andy Cohen asked her if she had sex with the then Green Bay Packers quarterback on game days.\n\nShe replied: 'No, we don't. Not on game days. There's not a rule, but it just doesn't happen because there are other things to focus on.'\n\nHowever, Munn said they occasionally have sex after Packers games. 'It depends on how late the game is...I try to have sex as much as I can,' she said.\n\nIncredible. God, I love this.\n\nOlivia Munn - who I know from The Newsroom, which was a decent little HBO show back in the day that was only somewhat woke - being the root cause of the Rodgers Family Drama because she told Andy Cohen about all the sex her and Aaron had 10 years ago is PEAK Aaron Rodgers stuff. Just the best.\n\nCan't wait to see how this book unfolds. I haven't read an actual book in a solid 15 years. Maybe more. But I may have to snag a copy of this one. Is Books-A-Million still a thing? If so, I'm going!\n\nFormer Nightcaps conductor Anthony Farris must be in pure hell. Having to watch that creep Deshaun Watson throw awful passes for 17 weeks, while knowing that you have a potential Super Bowl winner on the sidelines in Jameis Winston, must be a brutal way to spend the fall. I couldn't imagine it.\n\nPlay Jameis, you frauds!\n\nOK, two rapid-fire quickies so we can all go lock in for Pats-Panthers. First? This Polish sprinter is all over my Twitter timeline because everyone thinks she's Abella Danger, and it's time we welcome her to Nightcaps ... for obvious reasons:\n\nNo, I'm not sharing any Abella Danger content here. We have some class. Not a lot, but some. You know that. You know where to find it if you so choose. No judgment.\n\nAs for Ewa Swoboda - I'm all in. Love this girl. She's a pistol and is currently cracking skulls in Paris. There have been a couple real breakout stars in these Olympics, and Ewa is at the very top of the list. I think her career is about to take off like a rocket ship. Can't wait.\n\nFinally ... let's head out to Gavin Newsom's crime-riddled, anti-American California and check in on a local Camping World RV dealership:\n\nPickleballer Tara Bernstein takes us home\n\nAmen, Marcus! That's #MyCEO! Don't let the wokes out there tell you when, where, how, or how high to fly Old Glory. Never bend the knee to them, especially in California.\n\nHey, Gavin - piss off. This is America. We fly our flags proudly here, and if it falls on someone and crushes them to dust, then so be it. Frankly, any great patriot would be proud to go out that way.\n\nOK, we're gonna go ahead and let Nightcaps OG, and professional pickleballer, Tara Bernstein take us home on National Pickleball Day.\n\nOutKick Nightcaps is a daily column set to run Monday through Friday at 4 p.m. (roughly, we're not robots).", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"},

She said prosecutors on staff now don't have the capacity to process all of the alleged offences in the New Brunswick system.\n\nThis doesn't just affect Crown prosecutors, but also victims of crime and the people who have been accused, she said.\n\nDespite ratifying the agreement, the association won't be quiet about the issues within the justice system.\n\n\"Yes, our members are going to be compensated more fairly and more competitively, but that doesn't make the job any easier to do, and it doesn't make, you know, keeping people any easier when we're up against those workloads,\" she said.\n\n\"The vacancy rates are alarmingly high, and so we're going to need government to get creative on how they're going to address this.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Brunswick", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Brunswick"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Brunswick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crown attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Ontario", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Ontario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_Board_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treasury Board of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Steeves", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ernie Steeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Finance_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Finance (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nova Scotia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nova Scotia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Developers_and_Publishers/Iron_Crown_Enterprises", "label": "dmoz/Games/Developers and Publishers/Iron Crown Enterprises", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Sharing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Sharing", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.6759645.1677270718!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/shara-munn.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799915", "eventUri": "eng-9799915", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Because I do love him. I don't have animosity toward him, even with all the stuff that's been said and done.\"\n\nAaron and Ed have had a fractured relationship for years, with Ed telling The New York Times in 2017 that \"fame can change things\" and describing his relationship with Aaron as \"complicated.\" Ed and his wife, Darla, have suggested Aaron's former girlfriend Olivia Munn was responsible for causing a wedge in the family, which both Aaron and Olivia have denied.\n\nThe family feud has also engulfed Aaron's brothers, Jordan and Luke, both of whom continue to be estranged from the NFL quarterback.\n\n\"It had been so long since we even looked at each other,\" Ed says in the book of their reunion. \"I just kind of froze.\"\n\nAaron was the first to speak, telling his father, \"Hi Pops,\" before the two embraced.\n\nEd said they both told each other \"I love you\" and that he began to cry as his son left to finish his round of golf.\n\n\"It was amazing,\" he remembers.\n\nOnce his round was complete, Aaron recalled telling caddie and longtime friend Jordan Russell, \"I think that was what needed to happen.\"\n\nStill, their surprise meeting in Lake Tahoe didn't exactly lead to a long-lasting reconciliation. In the book, Aaron tells author Ian O'Connor that any potential path forward will be dictated by his father.\n\n\"It's just timing, just timing,\" Aaron says. \"Every time I think it's getting closer some weird things happen.

He had not seen them since late in Green Bay's 2014 season.\n\nLast summer, before the 40-year-old made his debut with the Jets, Ed bought a ticket to see his son compete in the American Century Championship celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, according to an excerpt from the upcoming book Out of the Darkness: The Mystery of Aaron Rodgers, reported by the New York Post on Thursday, August 8.\n\nAccording to the account in the book -- written by Ian O'Connor -- Aaron, unaware of the trip, spotted his father on his way to the bathroom. He considered avoiding him but ultimately decided that facing his dad would be the best decision for both of them.\n\n\"I could do a lot of things,\" Aaron explained. \"But I just thought, 'What's best in this moment, and what kind of gift could I give him?' Because I do love him. I don't have animosity toward him, even with all the stuff that's been said and done.\"\n\nAaron greeted his father with, \"Hi Pops,\" before the two embraced.\n\nEd, taken aback by his son's direct approach, explained, \"It had been so long since we even looked at each other. I just kind of froze.\"\n\nThey exchanged \"I love yous,\" which Ed noted \"was amazing,\" and he began to cry as his son left to finish his round of golf.\n\nAfter the round, Aaron told his caddie and longtime friend, Jordan Russell, \"I think that was what needed to happen.\" He echoed the sentiment later to O'Connor, saying, \"That was a special moment,\" and added that he believes the path to reconciliation with his family would be through his father.\n\nThe father and son's yearslong fractured relationship has been linked to Aaron's former girlfriend, Olivia Munn, whom the family believed was responsible for causing a wedge within their household -- a claim both Aaron and Olivia have denied. Ed told The New York Times in 2017 that \"fame can change things,\" while describing his relationship with Aaron as \"complicated.\"\n\nEd and Darla, with Aaron's knowledge, attended their son's Jets debut against Buffalo on the 9/11 anniversary last year and continued attending occasional Packers games even after Aaron stopped communicating with them.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodlife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hollywood Life"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Century_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Century Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Day_O'Connor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sandra Day O'Connor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tahoe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lake Tahoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Munn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olivia Munn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1891536091_0867ee-e1723216558511.jpg?quality=100&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799915", "eventUri": "eng-9799915", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 675, "textEnd": 683}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 460914807, "relevance": 2}

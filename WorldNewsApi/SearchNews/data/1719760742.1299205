{"id": 225019470, "title": "Meghan Markle to Focus on Substance Over Sensationalism", "text": "Meghan Markle's upcoming solo-podcast project marks a significant step in her post-royal career, but will challenge her to remain \"engaged, humble, and interesting\" to an audience that has come to expect sensationalist royal bombshells, an entertainment expert has told Newsweek.Meghan announced a new partnership with the Lemonada Media audio production company in February 2024, after dissolving a joint partnership alongside Prince Harry with streaming giant Spotify eight months earlier.At the time the new partnership was announced, Meghan said in a news release that she was proud to be joining the female-founded company and that she was working on a \"dynamic new podcast,\" which she was \"eager to be able to share\" soon.So far, three months after the announcement, updates on the podcast's development have yet to be released; the duchess has also revealed she is working on a new lifestyle show for Netflix and launching her American Riviera Orchard brand. Newsweek approached representatives of Meghan Markle via email for comment.As fans await the new show, Mark Boardman, entertainment expert and founder of MarkMeets, told Newsweek that Meghan should prioritize translating into the project the authenticity and substance that won her praise from her first successful podcast series, Archetypes. The Spotify series won Meghan a People's Choice and Gracie award.\"Meghan Markle's partnership with Lemonada Media marks a significant step in her post-royal career trajectory and an ongoing commitment focused on using new media ventures to weave to find her niche,\" Boardman said.\"Lemonada, known for its thought-provoking and socially conscious podcasts, could better align well with Meghan's own advocacy and interest in storytelling to establish the Sussex brand further. I would imagine the platform would be looking to work alongside Meghan and her team closely behind the scenes on every move to ensure success and reach is maximized.\"On the direction the duchess should be moving toward with her new show, Boardman said her narrative must be \"meticulously prepared, featuring probing questions and showcasing her authentic voice and personality to engage listeners and attract advertisers.\"\"This move signifies Meghan's intent to carve out her own identity distinct from the royal sphere, focusing on entertainment and leveraging her acting skills,\" Boardman added.\"Her newly strengthened PR team will advise of no more royal bombshells, with more substantive content over sensationalism, so to better use her acting skills at the highest level on each project is imperative. Meghan must remain engaged, humble, and interesting, whilst trying to blend personal insight with universal appeal.\"This move away from royal bombshells will be a key transition for Meghan. Until now, she has benefited from the increased press and social-media attention that reflections on her time as a member of the royal family have brought to her projects.Not only was the 2022 Netflix docuseries Harry & Meghan packed with royal insight, but the first episode of Archetypes also included the bombshell revelation that Prince Archie's nursery caught fire during a royal tour of South Africa, immediately after which she felt compelled to carry out official duties.\"The first two episodes [of Meghan's upcoming podcast] will give us a good idea of the direction as to what will follow, but I would expect rigorous feedback will come from the first podcast,\" Boardman said. \"Positive feedback will be crucial and key in securing lasting success in the podcasting industry.\"James Crawford-Smith is Newsweek's royal reporter, based in London.

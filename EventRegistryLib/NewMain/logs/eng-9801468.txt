What to watch for as breaking kicks off at the Olympics", "body": "There are a lot of complex elements to breaking, more commonly known as breakdancing, as it debuts on the world stage at the 2024 Olympics.\n\nPARIS, France -- The b-girls and b-boys are ready for their spotlight.\n\nOn Friday, the breakers, or breakdancers, begin syncing their moves to the DJ's breakbeat in front of the biggest audience breaking has ever known.\n\nEarlier this week, the dancers-turned-athletes at the Summer Olympics tested out the dance floor of the breaking venue at the Place de la Concorde in Paris ahead of the first competition on Friday. The stage resembles a giant record and the backdrop is a massive replica of a boombox. It's a nod to the musical root of breaking -- the breakbeat itself -- the moment when a song's vocals drop and the DJ loops the beat over and over, to allow b-boys and b-girls to make their mark on the dance floor.\n\n\"Even though people weren't there yet, I could just see the crowd already,\" American Logan Edra, or \"b-girl Logistx,\" said after seeing the stadium for the first time. \"And the floor felt amazing.\"\n\nThe 33 breakers representing 15 countries and the Refugee Olympic Team will take to the dance floor on Friday and Saturday, vying for gold for the first time in Olympic history.\n\nFor first-time watchers, there's a lot to understand about the elements of breaking. Beyond the dance form's unique culture and history stemming from Black and brown communities in the Bronx in the 1970s, there is no other event like it at the Olympics. Some have likened it to a mix of gymnastics and martial arts, but with music and improvisation. Breaking has its own judging structure -- the Trivium judging system, which will allow judges to evaluate breakers on their technique, vocabulary or variety, execution, musicality and originality.\n\n\"This is also going to be the only sport where they're going to incorporate other elements of hip-hop, because there's going to be a DJ and there's going to be a host, or an emcee,\" said Ronnie Abaldonado, a breaker who is one of NBC's commentators for the breaking competition.\n\nThe DJ has a major role in orchestrating the flow of the competition.\n\n\"No matter whether it's a high-production event or just a local gym, breaking is always about the party,\" said Zack Slusser, vice president of Breaking for Gold USA and USA Dance. \"And the DJ facilitates that party.\"\n\nSlusser described breaking as live storytelling, with characters and emotion all present on the stage, unfolding a narrative in real time.\n\nThe DJ \"establishes the energy in the room. He's kind of like the narrator, and then the breakers themselves, they're the protagonist or antagonist in the story, but the audience at the event, or the people watching -- reading the book -- they have to feel that energy.\"\n\nThe breakers won't know what songs or music they'll compete to -- the element of surprise is just as much a part of their experience as the audience's. It leads to an atmosphere that's raw, emotional and energetic. The stadium will be transformed by that energy, said Tyquan Hodac, executive director of Breaking for Gold USA.\n\n\"It's not a spectator sport. The audience is part of the whole show as well, they're part of the party,\" Hodac said. \"There's a feedback loop. It's a story, a conversation between everyone.\"\n\nBreaking itself is made up of four primary elements: Toprock, Power moves, Footwork and Freezes.\n\nWithin those elements are an infinite combination of moves that make up a dancer's routine. Routines are rehearsed, but dancers have to be careful not to be repetitive and keep the spontaneity and improvisational aspect of the performance at its core. And \"biting,\" or copying, a set of moves from an opponent can cost them.\n\nThe Olympic competition will begin in a round-robin phase, when groups of four breakers will face off against each other one by one. Only two will emerge from each round-robin group before the quarterfinals, semifinals and the final matchup to determine the champion by the end of the evening.\n\nThe b-girls will begin on Friday with a pre-qualifier between India Sardjoe of the Netherlands, or \"b-girl India,\" against the refugee team's Manizha Talash, or \"b-girl Talash,\" who is originally from Afghanistan and sought asylum in Spain. Talash was a late addition to the Olympic roster -- she missed registration for any qualifying breaking events, but her story of breaking and defying the strict rule of the Taliban in her home country captured the attention of the International Olympic Committee executive board, and she was invited to participate.\n\nThe b-boys take the stage on Saturday.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the four elements to look for in the breaking competition:\n\nHow a breaker starts their dance, while still standing, before going to the floor. It's an introduction to the dancer and their style, before they launch onto the floor into their footwork and other moves.\n\nAlso known as \"downrock,\" there are moves done on the ground, with support from hands, as the breaker moves their legs through a variety of steps.\n\nDynamic moves that highlight acrobatics and strength, using repetitive, circular movements, including head spins, air flares and windmills.\n\nA static position when a breaker hits and holds a move for a few seconds. It's most appreciated when it's synced up with a particular beat or sound in the music.", "source": {"uri": "13wmaz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WMAZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Team USA breakers are not just focused on nailing their moves, they're serving as ambassadors of the birthplace of a culture and lifestyle now deemed an Olympic sport.\n\nPARIS (AP) -- The journey of Olympic breaking was a long one that began with a vision -- one that early pioneers of the art form in the 1970s in the Bronx hardly dreamed of.\n\nThe 33 breakers representing 15 countries and the Refugee Olympic Team will make their debut Friday and Saturday, vying for gold for the first time in Olympic history. The b-girls will be the first to battle each other, one-by-one, first through a round-robin phase. They'll follow rules based on the Trivium judging system, which asks judges to evaluate breakers on their technique, vocabulary or variety, execution, musicality and originality.\n\nLike gymnastics, breakers have certain moves and tricks they work to land with precision and focus, but they'll also need to emphasize their style, personality and individuality as they sync to the beat of the DJ's soundtrack.\n\nThe elements of style and individuality play out from what the dancers wear, to their \"signature moves,\" to their b-boy or b-girl names themselves. No other Olympic sport has the structure of identifying the competitors this way, but it's a part of preserving the culture and essence of hip-hop in the art form, said Zack Slusser, vice president of Breaking for Gold USA and USA Dance.\n\n\"People coming into breaking need to understand that there's a history here of expression, especially from where it comes from,\" said Slusser. Hip-hop was born as a youth culture within Black and brown communities in the Bronx as a way to escape strife and socio-economic struggles and make a statement of empowerment at a time when they were labeled as lost, lawless kids by New York politicians.\n\nA statement of individuality\n\n\"Hip-hop is about building that individuality and that style, that character. You just want to make sure your presence is known,\" said American Jeffrey Louis, or \"b-boy Jeffro,\" who compared b-boy style to a signature on a document.\n\n\"Your signature is your stamp of approval ... your presence is known. And if you look good and you feel good, of course, you're probably going to perform well, so it all ties into that performance.\"\n\nBeyond the athletics, it's about identity, self-expression, personality and charisma, and the breakers will be bearing it all on stage for the judges to evaluate and the audience to receive.\n\n\"I feel like I've been able to tap into different eras,\" said Logan Edra, or \"b-girl Logistx,\" from Team USA. \"My style is infinite. I tap into different styles and I have different portals that I'm able to channel through for my style and for my breaking.\"\n\nFor Dominika Banevi\u010d, or \"b-girl Nicka\", from Lithuania, it was important to familiarize herself with the origins of the dance and the moves the original breakers from the 1970s were hitting. The 17-year-old is one of the youngest breakers on the roster, but she values tradition above all.\n\n\"The beauty of breaking is to develop your own style ... but you have to learn the foundation really well. Learn the basics first, then you can come up with your own style,\" she said.\n\nBreaking competition begins\n\nThe b-girls will start Friday with a pre-qualifier between India Sardjoe of the Netherlands, or \"b-girl India,\" against the refugee team's Manizha Talash, or \"b-girl Talash,\" who is originally from Afghanistan and sought asylum in Spain. Talash was a late addition to the Olympic roster -- she missed registration for any qualifying breaking events, but her story of breaking and defying the strict rule of the Taliban in her home country captured the attention of the International Olympic Committee executive board, and she was invited to participate.\n\nThe b-boys take the stage Saturday.\n\nBreaking's Olympic future is murky\n\nBreaking is not in the lineup of sports for the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, and Slusser said he's skeptical it'll make it into the events for Brisbane in 2032. It all comes down to funding.\n\n\"It was a miracle that we were even in Paris to begin with,\" he said. But for the breaking community, it's an achievement worth celebrating, even if it doesn't return to the Olympic stage.\n\nIn the end, breakers from the U.S. and around the world are hoping their debut at the Olympics leads to visibility and more resources for the breaking community through stakeholders and financial gains.\n\n\"The amount of exposure to the right people that can bring real change to our community, to our platform to help it grow -- it'll be significant to us. It'll allow us, for the first time, to find sustainability and help us elevate our platform,\" Slusser said.\n\n\"It would be great to see breaking make it back to the Olympic Games again. But at the same time, it's really going to go back to community work and leveraging this opportunity internally.\" ___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games",

Here's how it works", "body": "The Paris Olympics are fast approaching. Here's what you need to know about the first post-pandemic Games.\n\nEvery four years, the Summer Olympics shine a spotlight on some of the oldest known sports - events like track and field or wrestling, whose roots date back more than a century.\n\nBut in recent years, the Olympics have also featured new, exciting sports too. And that's where breaking comes in.\n\nBreaking, more commonly known as breakdancing, is part of the new wave of sports that the International Olympic Committee has ushered in as part of a broader effort to appeal to younger fans and add an urban flair to the Summer Games. It follows the addition of sports such as skateboarding and surfing, which debuted at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\n\nWhen did breaking become an Olympic sport?\n\nBreaking is the only new sport at the 2024 Paris Olympics, and it has not been included in the initial sports program for the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.\n\nThat means breaking could very well be a one-and-done sport in the Olympics.\n\nHow does Olympic breaking work? What are the rules?\n\nAt the Olympics, the men's and women's breaking competitions will consist of a series of one-on-one battles, with each B-boy or B-girl trying to impress a panel of nine judges by executing a variety of moves. There are multiple rounds per battle, and in each round, competitors will try to land power moves - acrobatic spins, flips and the like - while also mixing in what is called \"top rocking,\" or dance elements performed while upright. They're also judged on criteria such as \"musicality\" and \"vocabulary,\" which reflect how they interact with the music.\n\nThough hip-hop is the soundtrack for every battle, competitors don't know ahead of time what style or tempo of music the DJ will play during each round. The top performers are able to both practice and prepare specific combinations of moves, but then adapt to the style of the music. Creativity is one of the key criteria for judging, which is fairly subjective.\n\nWho are the top Team USA athletes in breaking?\n\nVictor Montalvo, who competes as B-boy Victor, qualified for Paris by winning the 2023 world championships in Belgium. He's been competing for more than a decade and is widely considered to be one of the top competitive breakers in the world. B-boy Jeffro will be the other American man in the field after he nabbed a late qualifying spot.\n\nSunny Choi (or B-girl Sunny) and Logan Edra (or B-girl Logistx) will represent Team USA on the women's side. Choi won the 2023 Pan American Games, while Edra has had past success in Red Bull's international breaking competition, BC One.\n\nWhat's the international landscape in Olympic breaking?\n\nBreaking was born in the Bronx in New York, so it should come as no surprise that the U.S. is one of the sport's dominant powers. But Japan, led by veteran B-boy Shigekix, is also consistently toward the top of the pack and figures to win at least one breaking medal in Paris. Canada, China, France and the Netherlands could also see their competitors in the medal mix.\n\nHow to watch breaking at the Olympics\n\nThe breaking competitions at the 2024 Paris Games will all be televised live on E!, with the women's competition slated to begin at 10:30 a.m. ET on Friday and conclude with the finals, which start at 2 p.m. ET. The men's competition will take place at the same times Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "what_to_know@usatoday.com",

The b-girls will be the first to battle each other, one-by-one, first through a round-robin phase. They\u00b4ll follow rules based on the Trivium judging system, which asks judges to evaluate breakers on their technique, vocabulary or variety, execution, musicality and originality.\n\nLike gymnastics, breakers have certain moves and tricks they work to land with precision and focus, but they\u00b4ll also need to emphasize their style, personality and individuality as they sync to the beat of the DJ's soundtrack.\n\nThe elements of style and individuality play out from what the dancers wear, to their \"signature moves,\" to their b-boy or b-girl names themselves. No other Olympic sport has the structure of identifying the competitors this way, but it\u00b4s a part of preserving the culture and essence of hip-hop in the art form, said Zack Slusser, vice president of Breaking for Gold USA and USA Dance.\n\n\"People coming into breaking need to understand that there\u00b4s a history here of expression, especially from where it comes from,\" said Slusser. Hip-hop was born as a youth culture within Black and brown communities in the Bronx as a way to escape strife and socio-economic struggles and make a statement of empowerment at a time when they were labeled as lost, lawless kids by New York politicians.\n\n\"Hip-hop is about building that individuality and that style, that character. You just want to make sure your presence is known,\" said American Jeffrey Louis, or \"b-boy Jeffro,\" who compared b-boy style to a signature on a document.\n\n\"Your signature is your stamp of approval ... your presence is known. And if you look good and you feel good, of course, you\u00b4re probably going to perform well, so it all ties into that performance.\"\n\nBeyond the athletics, it\u00b4s about identity, self-expression, personality and charisma, and the breakers will be bearing it all on stage for the judges to evaluate and the audience to receive.\n\n\"I feel like I\u00b4ve been able to tap into different eras,\" said Logan Edra, or \"b-girl Logistx,\" from Team USA. \"My style is infinite. I tap into different styles and I have different portals that I\u00b4m able to channel through for my style and for my breaking.\"\n\nFor Dominika Banevic, or \"b-girl Nicka\", from Lithuania, it was important to familiarize herself with the origins of the dance and the moves the original breakers from the 1970s were hitting. The 17-year-old is one of the youngest breakers on the roster, but she values tradition above all.\n\n\"The beauty of breaking is to develop your own style ... but you have to learn the foundation really well. Learn the basics first, then you can come up with your own style,\" she said.\n\nThe b-girls will start Friday with a pre-qualifier between India Sardjoe of the Netherlands, or \"b-girl India,\" against the refugee team\u00b4s Manizha Talash, or \"b-girl Talash,\" who is originally from Afghanistan and sought asylum in Spain. Talash was a late addition to the Olympic roster - she missed registration for any qualifying breaking events, but her story of breaking and defying the strict rule of the Taliban in her home country captured the attention of the International Olympic Committee executive board, and she was invited to participate.\n\nThe b-boys take the stage Saturday.\n\nBreaking is not in the lineup of sports for the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, and Slusser said he\u00b4s skeptical it\u00b4ll make it into the events for Brisbane in 2032. It all comes down to funding.\n\n\"It was a miracle that we were even in Paris to begin with,\" he said. But for the breaking community, it\u00b4s an achievement worth celebrating, even if it doesn\u00b4t return to the Olympic stage.\n\nIn the end, breakers from the U.S. and around the world are hoping their debut at the Olympics leads to visibility and more resources for the breaking community through stakeholders and financial gains.\n\n\"The amount of exposure to the right people that can bring real change to our community, to our platform to help it grow - it\u00b4ll be significant to us. It\u00b4ll allow us, for the first time, to find sustainability and help us elevate our platform,\" Slusser said.\n\n\"It would be great to see breaking make it back to the Olympic Games again. But at the same time, it\u00b4s really going to go back to community work and leveraging this opportunity internally.\" ___", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

The b-girls will be the first to battle each other, one-by-one, first through a round-robin phase. They'll follow rules based on the Trivium judging system, which asks judges to evaluate breakers on their technique, vocabulary or variety, execution, musicality and originality.\n\nLike gymnastics, breakers have certain moves and tricks they work to land with precision and focus, but they'll also need to emphasize their style, personality and individuality as they sync to the beat of the DJ's soundtrack.\n\nThe elements of style and individuality play out from what the dancers wear, to their \"signature moves,\" to their b-boy or b-girl names themselves. No other Olympic sport has the structure of identifying the competitors this way, but it's a part of preserving the culture and essence of hip-hop in the art form, said Zack Slusser, vice president of Breaking for Gold USA and USA Dance.\n\n\"People coming into breaking need to understand that there's a history here of expression, especially from where it comes from,\" said Slusser. Hip-hop was born as a youth culture within Black and brown communities in the Bronx as a way to escape strife and socio-economic struggles and make a statement of empowerment at a time when they were labeled as lost, lawless kids by New York politicians.\n\nA statement of individuality\n\n\"Hip-hop is about building that individuality and that style, that character. You just want to make sure your presence is known,\" said American Jeffrey Louis, or \"b-boy Jeffro,\" who compared b-boy style to a signature on a document.\n\n\"Your signature is your stamp of approval ... your presence is known. And if you look good and you feel good, of course, you're probably going to perform well, so it all ties into that performance.\"\n\nBeyond the athletics, it's about identity, self-expression, personality and charisma, and the breakers will be bearing it all on stage for the judges to evaluate and the audience to receive.\n\n\"I feel like I've been able to tap into different eras,\" said Logan Edra, or \"b-girl Logistx,\" from Team USA. \"My style is infinite. I tap into different styles and I have different portals that I'm able to channel through for my style and for my breaking.\"\n\nFor Dominika Banevi\u010d, or \"b-girl Nicka\", from Lithuania, it was important to familiarize herself with the origins of the dance and the moves the original breakers from the 1970s were hitting. The 17-year-old is one of the youngest breakers on the roster, but she values tradition above all.\n\n\"The beauty of breaking is to develop your own style ... but you have to learn the foundation really well. Learn the basics first, then you can come up with your own style,\" she said.\n\nBreaking competition begins\n\nThe b-girls will start Friday with a pre-qualifier between India Sardjoe of the Netherlands, or \"b-girl India,\" against the refugee team's Manizha Talash, or \"b-girl Talash,\" who is originally from Afghanistan and sought asylum in Spain. Talash was a late addition to the Olympic roster -- she missed registration for any qualifying breaking events, but her story of breaking and defying the strict rule of the Taliban in her home country captured the attention of the International Olympic Committee executive board, and she was invited to participate.\n\nBreaking is not in the lineup of sports for the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, and Slusser said he's skeptical it'll make it into the events for Brisbane in 2032. It all comes down to funding.\n\n\"It was a miracle that we were even in Paris to begin with,\" he said. But for the breaking community, it's an achievement worth celebrating, even if it doesn't return to the Olympic stage.\n\nIn the end, breakers from the U.S. and around the world are hoping their debut at the Olympics leads to visibility and more resources for the breaking community through stakeholders and financial gains.\n\n\"The amount of exposure to the right people that can bring real change to our community, to our platform to help it grow -- it'll be significant to us. It'll allow us, for the first time, to find sustainability and help us elevate our platform,\" Slusser said.\n\n\"It would be great to see breaking make it back to the Olympic Games again. But at the same time, it's really going to go back to community work and leveraging this opportunity internally.\" ___", "source": {"uri": "kion546.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KION546"},

What to watch for as breaking...", "body": "PARIS (AP) - The b-girls and b-boys are ready for their spotlight.\n\nOn Friday, the breakers, or breakdancers, begin syncing their moves to the DJ's breakbeat in front of the biggest audience breaking has ever known.\n\nEarlier this week, the dancers-turned-athletes at the Summer Olympics tested out the dance floor of the breaking venue at the Place de la Concorde in Paris ahead of the first competition on Friday. The stage resembles a giant record and the backdrop is a massive replica of a boombox. It's a nod to the musical root of breaking - the breakbeat itself - the moment when a song's vocals drop and the DJ loops the beat over and over, to allow b-boys and b-girls to make their mark on the dance floor.\n\n\"Even though people weren\u00b4t there yet, I could just see the crowd already,\" American Logan Edra, or \"b-girl Logistx,\" said after seeing the stadium for the first time. \"And the floor felt amazing.\"\n\nThe 33 breakers representing 15 countries and the Refugee Olympic Team will take to the dance floor on Friday and Saturday, vying for gold for the first time in Olympic history.\n\nFor first-time watchers, there\u00b4s a lot to understand about the elements of breaking. Beyond the dance form's unique culture and history stemming from Black and brown communities in the Bronx in the 1970s, there is no other event like it at the Olympics. Some have likened it to a mix of gymnastics and martial arts, but with music and improvisation. Breaking has its own judging structure - the Trivium judging system, which will allow judges to evaluate breakers on their technique, vocabulary or variety, execution, musicality and originality.\n\nFILE - Logan Edra of the United States, known as B-Girl Logistx, competes during the World Breaking Championships in Leuven, Belgium, Sunday, Sept 24, 2023. (AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert, File)\n\n\"This is also going to be the only sport where they\u00b4re going to incorporate other elements of hip-hop, because there\u00b4s going to be a DJ and there\u00b4s going to be a host, or an emcee,\" said Ronnie Abaldonado, a breaker who is one of NBC\u00b4s commentators for the breaking competition.\n\nThe DJ has a major role in orchestrating the flow of the competition.\n\n\"No matter whether it\u00b4s a high-production event or just a local gym, breaking is always about the party,\" said Zack Slusser, vice president of Breaking for Gold USA and USA Dance. \"And the DJ facilitates that party.\"\n\nSlusser described breaking as live storytelling, with characters and emotion all present on the stage, unfolding a narrative in real time.\n\nThe DJ \"establishes the energy in the room. He\u00b4s kind of like the narrator, and then the breakers themselves, they're the protagonist or antagonist in the story, but the audience at the event, or the people watching - reading the book - they have to feel that energy.\"\n\nThe breakers won't know what songs or music they'll compete to - the element of surprise is just as much a part of their experience as the audience's. It leads to an atmosphere that's raw, emotional and energetic. The stadium will be transformed by that energy, said Tyquan Hodac, executive director of Breaking for Gold USA.\n\n\"It's not a spectator sport. The audience is part of the whole show as well, they're part of the party,\" Hodac said. \"There's a feedback loop. It's a story, a conversation between everyone.\"\n\nBreaking itself is made up of four primary elements: Toprock, Power moves, Footwork and Freezes.\n\nWithin those elements are an infinite combination of moves that make up a dancer's routine. Routines are rehearsed, but dancers have to be careful not to be repetitive and keep the spontaneity and improvisational aspect of the performance at its core. And \"biting,\" or copying, a set of moves from an opponent can cost them.\n\nThe Olympic competition will begin in a round-robin phase, when groups of four breakers will face off against each other one by one. Only two will emerge from each round-robin group before the quarterfinals, semifinals and the final matchup to determine the champion by the end of the evening.\n\nThe b-girls will begin on Friday with a pre-qualifier between India Sardjoe of the Netherlands, or \"b-girl India,\" against the refugee team's Manizha Talash, or \"b-girl Talash,\" who is originally from Afghanistan and sought asylum in Spain. Talash was a late addition to the Olympic roster - she missed registration for any qualifying breaking events, but her story of breaking and defying the strict rule of the Taliban in her home country captured the attention of the International Olympic Committee executive board, and she was invited to participate.\n\nThe b-boys take the stage on Saturday.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the four elements to look for in the breaking competition:\n\nHow a breaker starts their dance, while still standing, before going to the floor. It's an introduction to the dancer and their style, before they launch onto the floor into their footwork and other moves.\n\nAlso known as \"downrock,\" there are moves done on the ground, with support from hands, as the breaker moves their legs through a variety of steps.\n\nDynamic moves that highlight acrobatics and strength, using repetitive, circular movements, including head spins, air flares and windmills.\n\nA static position when a breaker hits and holds a move for a few seconds. It's most appreciated when it's synced up with a particular beat or sound in the music.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nFILE - Jeffrey Louis works out with teammates during a breaking practice session at the Team USA training facility at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Tuesday, July 30, 2024, in Eaubonne, France.

Here's Why I'm Obsessed with It.", "body": "No one expected breakdancing -- the street dancing style that incorporates head spins and freeze moves -- to ever become an Olympic sport. Even members of the World DanceSport Federation, the governing body of competitive dancing, were surprised to learn in 2020 that \"breaking,\" as it is called, had been added to the lineup for the 2024 Games in Paris.\n\n\"It was a shock to everybody,\" says Martin Gilian, a member of the World DanceSport Federation, and one of nine judges who will score the Olympic breaking competition on August 9 and 10. \"We had no idea how we got into the Youth Olympics in 2018 and suddenly we were finding out we'd be in Paris.\"\n\nThe truth is that breaking has resonated with younger audiences since it was born on the streets of New York City's South Bronx more than 50 years ago. In fact, as an original element of hip-hop -- alongside deejaying, emceeing, and graffiti -- breaking has never stopped pushing boundaries. Is it an art form or a sport? Debate it all you want, but to me, it's clear that breaking is both.\n\nBreaking's inclusion in the 2024 Summer Games is nod to the graffiti we see in Europe's first collection of modern and contemporary art at Centre Pompidou in Paris; and to the rap of this year's Olympic hype men Snoop Dogg and MC Solaar of France. I'm pretty much obsessed with breaking's Olympic debut. Drawn to its combination of history, physical strength, and creative expression, I'll be in the stands at the Paris Olympics on August 9, cheering on the athletes, which fans call \"B-Girls\" and \"B-Boys.\" On La Concorde in the heart of Paris, next to BMX freestyle, skateboarding, and 3X3 basketball, in one big \"hip hop celebration\" breaking will take place outdoors in an urban park. Here's what to know about the newest Olympic event:\n\nBreaking's top athletes draw from thousands of tricks, and they improvise signature moves never performed by anyone in competition until the Olympics. Athletes will be judged on their technique, dance vocabulary, execution, musicality, and originality, with each category counting for 20 percent of overall score.\n\nOn August 9, 17 B-Girls will face off in one-on-one 60-second dance battles. Among them will be 35-year-old American Grace Sun \"Sunny\" Choi, who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's business school. Also in the lineup is 21-year-old Manizha \"Jawad\" Talash, a refugee and Afghanistan's first female breaker who fled the Taliban, as well as Italian Antilai Sandrini, who goes by the name \"B-Girl Anti,\" and is an artistic gymnast and cheerleader-turned breaker who is also a competitive Kung Fu athlete.\n\nThen, on August 10, 16 B-Boys will follow the same format, laying down flips and flares. According to Gilian, the event borrows some DNA from martial arts and gymnastics. \"Breakers are always trying to evolve and make their own signature moves,\" he says. In this evolving and improvisational sport, breakers introduce personalized moves from the main elements of standing moves, called \"top rock,\" floor moves, called \"down rock,\" and freeze, which is holding a pose in an unusual position.\n\n\"It's about improvisational storytelling, following a concept throughout the entire round. For example, a dancer could hold his chin the entire round, even while going down on the floor in a power move (a twist and spin)\" says Gilian. \"Or he might hear the sound of a bird that inspires him to express the sound throughout the dance. It's as creative as possible.\"\n\nIn a round robin, the top two from each of the four men's and women's groups will advance to the quarterfinals, then semis, and a best-of-three final for the medals, putting on a show for the Olympic audience while they can. Sadly, breaking is expected to be left off the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games.\n\nGetting fired up is necessary at this new Olympic sport that relies more on audience participation than other Olympic events.\"One of the most important things to the sport is creating an atmosphere so the dancers can interact with the audience,\" says Gilian \"We don't want you to just come and watch. You really need to be involved if you're there and make some noise because the better the atmosphere, the better the performance.\"\n\nBreaking is also the only Olympic event where the judges get to perform. \"We're paying a tribute to hip-hop culture, so at the end we'll dance to a live rapper, while the DJ spins the music,\" says Gilian, who goes by the breaking name B-Boy MG -- all the judges double as breakers and Gilian, who used to compete, is also a rapper.\n\nGilian first witnessed breaking in 2004 in a Run DMC MTV music video as a student at Florida International University (Florida, a breaking hub, is also home of Olympic medal hopeful B-Boy \"Victor\" Montalvo. But of course breaking dates back to the 1969 gang activity in the South Bronx, when instead of taking a swing at each other, each side would pretend to fight in a dance battle.\n\nAs the story goes, on August 11, 1973, a Jamaican immigrant who went by DJ Kool Herc -- the godfather of hip hop culture -- was performing at an apartment and invited party goers to dance during percussive \"breaks' in his music. From the Black and Latino neighborhood street culture in New York City in the 1980s, the term \"breaking\" evolved in the media into \"breakdancing\" after the popular Rock Steady B-Boys and the B-Girls rose up in pop culture while touring the world stage. And as breaking faded from urban America in the 1990s, it was picking up in its first organized competitive world circuit heavily centered around Europe -- with the first major global \"Battle of the Year\" in Germany in 1990, followed by the first Red Bull breaking competition in 2001.\n\nIn 2016, the World DanceSport Federation proposed several competitive dancing styles to organizers of the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The federation hoped that one would be chosen, and Gilian and others believed that Latin dancing might be singled out. When the International Olympics Committee, which oversaw the event, chose breaking \"it came as a surprise, but was extremely popular for some reason,\" Gilian remembers.\n\nIn 2020, when breaking was officially added to the 2024 Paris Games, the decision drew some pushback. Critics argued that dancing wasn't a sport. It wasn't the first time the Olympics had to consider art as competition. Between 1912 and 1948, the Olympics included competitive events in the artistic categories of architecture, literature, music, painting, and sculpture.\n\nOfficials with the IOC and World DanceSport Federation faced plenty of hurdles to get breaking ready for the Olympics: standardizing rules and judging while maintaining the sport's artistic side. Rules require DJs to pick the same song at random for both dancers. The hosts, who narrate the competition on the mic, maintain a central role as physically close to the breakers on the dance floor as possible.\n\n\"We made sure that the audience could get as close as possible, so they could feed off the energy of the crowd and maintain the true essence of breaking. The IOC really came through and we've accomplished that,\" says Gilian. He says that breaking has experienced a resurgence in popularity since it was announced as an Olympic sport.\n\n\"We're seeing all around the world that parents are more motivated to get their kids into the breaking -- and nine and 10 year olds are learning basic moves in as little as two days that took me 10 or 11 months to master,\" says Gilian. \"There's been a huge growth in the last few years all around the world, especially in Asia, Europe, and Latin America.\"\n\nB-Girl Sunny: Grace Sunny Choi is a former gymnast who picked up breaking as a student at the prestigious University of Pennsylvania Wharton School. After graduating, she began battling in world-wide competitions, going on to win silver at the 2022 World Games.\n\nB-Girl Ayumi: With a recent win at the Olympic Qualifier in Shanghai, 2021 world champion Fukushima Ayumi of Japan is one to watch out for. At age 41, this veteran has the dynamics (transitions between down and up rock) and the experience to go far.\n\nB-Girl Ami: Ami Yuasa, of Japan, was introduced to hip-hop at age six. Today, the 25 year old is known for her footwork and flow (the art of combining moves in a creative and rhythmic way), after taking world championship titles in 2019 and 2022 and making the Red Bull BBC One World Final in 2023.\n\nB-Girl India: India Sardjoe, of the Netherlands, has been breaking since age 7 -- while also playing football as the only girl on an all-boys' team. Today, she's fearlessly competing at age 16 as one of the youngest Olympic Athletes, after winning gold in the 2023 European Games.\n\nB-Girl Nicka: This Lithuanian breakdancer is only 17 years old yet she's the current world champion. Dominika Banevic has it all-vocabulary, dynamics, flavor, and form and could take the win.\n\nB-Boy Victor: Victor Montalvo, 30, is living the dream of his father Victor Bermudez and his uncle Hector Bermudez -- twin-brother breaking pioneers who helped popularize the sport in Mexico in the 1980s. After growing up in Florida, he's the current world champion. Expect traditional style with loads of signature moves.\n\nB-Boy Hong 10: Born and raised in Seoul, South Korea, Kim Hong-Yul, 40, is a three-time Red Bull BC One champion with experience on his side. Loaded with an arsenal of innovative moves -- arguably the most original in the game -- he's one to watch.\n\nB-Boy Shigekix: This Olympic flag carrier from Japan is a Red Bull BC One All Star and the 2020 Red Bull BC One champion. Shigeyuki Nakarai is a former freestyle dancer known for his control and fast power moves (using the whole body in a rotational move while balancing on the hands, elbows, head, or shoulders).\n\nB-Boy Phil Wizard: Canada's Philip Kim was once a kid watching breaking in the street shows of downtown Vancouver. He took up the sport and went on to win gold at the 2022 World Championships and the 2023 Pan American Breaking Championships, also taking silver in the 2023 World Championships.\n\nB-Boy Lithe-ing: China's Qi Xiangyu, 19, is the new kid on the block coming up quickly after becoming runner up at the Olympic Qualifier Series in Shanghai and taking fourth at the 2023 World Championships.",

What to watch for as breaking kicks off at the Olympics", "body": "PARIS (AP) -- The b-girls and b-boys are ready for their spotlight.\n\nOn Friday, the breakers, or breakdancers, begin syncing their moves to the DJ's breakbeat in front of the biggest audience breaking has ever known.\n\nEarlier this week, the dancers-turned-athletes at the Summer Olympics tested out the dance floor of the breaking venue at the Place de la Concorde in Paris ahead of the first competition on Friday. The stage resembles a giant record and the backdrop is a massive replica of a boombox. It's a nod to the musical root of breaking -- the breakbeat itself -- the moment when a song's vocals drop and the DJ loops the beat over and over, to allow b-boys and b-girls to make their mark on the dance floor.\n\n\"Even though people weren't there yet, I could just see the crowd already,\" American Logan Edra, or \"b-girl Logistx,\" said after seeing the stadium for the first time. \"And the floor felt amazing.\"\n\nThe 33 breakers representing 15 countries and the Refugee Olympic Team will take to the dance floor on Friday and Saturday, vying for gold for the first time in Olympic history.\n\nFor first-time watchers, there's a lot to understand about the elements of breaking. Beyond the dance form's unique culture and history stemming from Black and brown communities in the Bronx in the 1970s, there is no other event like it at the Olympics. Some have likened it to a mix of gymnastics and martial arts, but with music and improvisation. Breaking has its own judging structure -- the Trivium judging system, which will allow judges to evaluate breakers on their technique, vocabulary or variety, execution, musicality and originality.\n\n\"This is also going to be the only sport where they're going to incorporate other elements of hip-hop, because there's going to be a DJ and there's going to be a host, or an emcee,\" said Ronnie Abaldonado, a breaker who is one of NBC's commentators for the breaking competition.\n\nThe DJ has a major role in orchestrating the flow of the competition.\n\n\"No matter whether it's a high-production event or just a local gym, breaking is always about the party,\" said Zack Slusser, vice president of Breaking for Gold USA and USA Dance. \"And the DJ facilitates that party.\"\n\nSlusser described breaking as live storytelling, with characters and emotion all present on the stage, unfolding a narrative in real time.\n\nThe DJ \"establishes the energy in the room. He's kind of like the narrator, and then the breakers themselves, they're the protagonist or antagonist in the story, but the audience at the event, or the people watching -- reading the book -- they have to feel that energy.\"\n\nThe breakers won't know what songs or music they'll compete to -- the element of surprise is just as much a part of their experience as the audience's. It leads to an atmosphere that's raw, emotional and energetic. The stadium will be transformed by that energy, said Tyquan Hodac, executive director of Breaking for Gold USA.\n\n\"It's not a spectator sport. The audience is part of the whole show as well, they're part of the party,\" Hodac said. \"There's a feedback loop. It's a story, a conversation between everyone.\"\n\nBreaking itself is made up of four primary elements: Toprock, Power moves, Footwork and Freezes.\n\nWithin those elements are an infinite combination of moves that make up a dancer's routine. Routines are rehearsed, but dancers have to be careful not to be repetitive and keep the spontaneity and improvisational aspect of the performance at its core. And \"biting,\" or copying, a set of moves from an opponent can cost them.\n\nThe Olympic competition will begin in a round-robin phase, when groups of four breakers will face off against each other one by one. Only two will emerge from each round-robin group before the quarterfinals, semifinals and the final matchup to determine the champion by the end of the evening.\n\nThe b-girls will begin on Friday with a pre-qualifier between India Sardjoe of the Netherlands, or \"b-girl India,\" against the refugee team's Manizha Talash, or \"b-girl Talash,\" who is originally from Afghanistan and sought asylum in Spain. Talash was a late addition to the Olympic roster -- she missed registration for any qualifying breaking events, but her story of breaking and defying the strict rule of the Taliban in her home country captured the attention of the International Olympic Committee executive board, and she was invited to participate.\n\nThe b-boys take the stage on Saturday.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the four elements to look for in the breaking competition:\n\nToprock\n\nHow a breaker starts their dance, while still standing, before going to the floor. It's an introduction to the dancer and their style, before they launch onto the floor into their footwork and other moves.\n\nFootwork\n\nAlso known as \"downrock,\" there are moves done on the ground, with support from hands, as the breaker moves their legs through a variety of steps.\n\nPower move\n\nDynamic moves that highlight acrobatics and strength, using repetitive, circular movements, including head spins, air flares and windmills.\n\nFreeze\n\nA static position when a breaker hits and holds a move for a few seconds. It's most appreciated when it's synced up with a particular beat or sound in the music.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri":

We're going to bring something new to the table, we're going to bring a vibe, we're going to bring that peace, love, unity,\" says breaker Victor Montalvo, otherwise known as \"B-Boy Victor\", who will be competing for Team US.\n\nIf terms like \"windmills\", \"Bronx step,\" and \"throwing down\" are unfamiliar to you, fear not. Here's your ultimate guide to the sport before it lights up the world's biggest sporting stage.\n\nHip-hop was born in the South Bronx in the 1970s, and with it came the rise of breaking, one of the movement's four foundational elements. The other elements are DJing, MCing (or rapping), and graffiti \"writing.\"\n\nAt its core, breaking was born from the desire of young people to dance during the energetic instrumental drum breaks of funk and soul records played by pioneering DJs like Kool Herc at neighbourhood block parties.\n\nClassic examples of breaks can be found on records like 'Apache' by the Incredible Bongo Band, 'Just Begun' by Jimmy Castor Bunch and 'The Mexican' by Babe Ruth. Early DJs would cue up two copies of the same record and skilfully loop these short snippets one after another to create a continuous beat.\n\nThe dance itself evolved from a combination of existing styles and movements, such as the energetic footwork of salsa, the acrobatic manoeuvres found in martial arts and the physicality of soul and Motown dancers like James Brown.\n\nThen came the 80s, a decade that catapulted breaking into the mainstream. The Rock Steady Crew, a legendary New York breakdance group, released the classic track 'Hey You' in 1983, featuring pioneering breakers like Crazy Legs, Ken Swift, and Kuriaki showcasing their moves.\n\nIn the same year, rap group RUN DMC's music video for 'It's Like That' platformed breakers battling it out, and the art form was also featured in the hugely popular movie Flashdance. These displays helped breaking gain attention overseas, particularly in Europe and Southeast Asia.\n\nWhile mainstream interest, in a similar fait to skateboarding, waned towards the end of the 80s, breaking continued growing in underground scenes and local communities.\n\nSince its birth, breaking has transformed from being a party dance to a worldwide competitive art form with hundreds of events, such as Red Bull BC One,* all over the world, thanks in part to the rise of the internet and social media, which helped boost its reach globally.\n\nIt was first introduced on the Olympic stage at the 2018 Summer Youth Games in Buenos Aires, where its success led the International Olympic Committee to include it in the 2024 line-up.\n\nOrganisers have stated that the sport's inclusion forms part of a larger mission to appeal to \"young people and reward creativity and athletic performance.\"\n\nSkateboarding, 3x3 basketball, and BMX freestyle will also take place alongside breaking at the Place de la Concorde, which has been described as \"the beating heart of urban sports and urban cultures.\"\n\nJudges at the Olympics will score breakers based on the Trivium judging system, which scores breakers on creativity, personality, technique, variety, performativity and musicality. The scores can fluctuate throughout the battle based on how breakers respond to their opponents.\n\nDancers will compete in one-on-one battles, each consisting of two 60-second throw downs. DJs will provide the music (a mix of funk, soul and contemporary hip-hop), while a host will manage the microphone.\n\nNine judges will then vote at the end of each battle to determine the winner.\n\n\"It's not about who spins the faster or who jumps the highest. If you're watching breaking for the first time try to view it as an art more than a sport. Really try to feel people's character when they dance and just enjoy it,\" says Menno van Gorp, a competitive b-boy who will be competing for the Netherlands in Paris.\n\nKnown on the worldwide breaking scene simply as Menno, he is one of the most accomplished, competitive b-boys, having won almost every major solo title there is.\n\nIn an interview with Red Bull, he stated: \"I have achieved everything in breaking that you can achieve. One thing that would be very nice to end my career with is a medal on the highest stage (referring to the Olympic Games in Paris).\"\n\nBefore all the excitement kicks off in Paris, it's worth getting familiar with some key terms and breaker lingo if you're tuning in to the sport for the first time:\n\nB-boy/b-girl - A male or female who practises the dance of breaking.\n\nThrow down - When a b-boy or b-girl hits the floor and starts breaking, they are doing a throw down.\n\nPower moves - Moves relying on speed, momentum, and acrobatic elements for performance. Common power moves include head spins, flares, air flares and windmills.\n\nToprock - Foot movement performed while standing, serving as the opening display of style. Common toprock steps include the Indian step, Bronx step and Charlie rock.\n\nDownrock - Any movement on the floor with the hands supporting the dancer as much as the feet. Common downrock moves include suicides, moonwalks and hand glides.\n\nFreezes - A technique that involves halting all body motion, often in an interesting or balance-intensive position in response to the music.\n\nRepeating - If a breaker is accused of 'repeating' in a battle it means that their opponent is saying that they're doing a move they've already performed during that competition.\n\nBite or biting - If a b-boy or b-girl is accused of 'biting' or 'being a biter' it means someone's saying that they have stolen or copied their moves or style from another breaker.", "source": {"uri":

Of course, global competitions are nothing new for breakers; the roster for the 2024 Olympics includes both reigning winners of the WDSF's World Breaking Championship, Victor \"B-Boy Victor\" Montalvo of the United States and Dominika \"B-Girl Nicka\" Banevi\u010d of Lithuania. But what if you're tuning in as someone who doesn't know your windmills from your backspins? \"If you get one thing out of this, understand that you're watching the purest form of hip-hop,\" says Luis \"Prevail\" Toledo, a New York-based breaker who has been dancing for 22 years and reps the Mighty Zulu Kingz, One Society, and Fresh Descendants crews. Below, a breakdown of the breaking basics, including why it's not \"breakdancing,\" how the events will be judged, when and where to tune in live, and its origins in hip-hop.\n\nBreaking originated in Black and brown communities in the Bronx as an outlet amid tense gang rivalries in the 1970s. Early practitioners \"had no escape from anything, so they wanted to dance it out through battles instead of actually having to fight,\" explains Toledo. The name comes from the \"break,\" or the percussive standout part of a song. When hip-hop founding father DJ Kool Herc noticed that people were going off on the dance floor during the breaks, he figured out how to extend those parts. (He's also credited with coming up with the terms \"B-boy\" and \"B-girl.\")\n\nThe main elements of breaking have pretty intuitive titles: Toprock refers to moves you do while standing up, downrock is what you do while you're on the floor, freezes are when you hit and hold an often gravity-defying pose, and power moves include acrobatic motions like spins.\n\nDo what you want ... but just know that some breakers will probably be rolling their eyes. \"Breakdancing\" is a word that was popularized by the media and sometimes incorrectly used to describe other street-dance styles, so it can represent an unwelcome simplification and commercialization to those who are protective of breaking culture. Victor \"B-Boy Victor\" Montalvo, a gold-medal favorite for the U.S. in the men's event, told Today that the media-made term has been considered \"corny.\" You might even get a nickname if you use it: \"They call them toys, people that don't know anything about the dance.\"\n\nLuckily, there's no need to wrap your head around a complicated points system. After a round-robin qualifier, breakers will battle each other in best-of-three rounds called \"throwdowns,\" where they'll get up to 60 seconds to improvise a routine to beats by New York's DJ Fleg or Poland's DJ Plash. During these one-on-one matchups, a panel of nine judges will move digital sliders in real time toward the side of whichever breaker they think is doing better in each of five different categories established by the WDSF:\n\nEach category is worth 20 percent, which means it is equally as important to, say, show off some advanced power moves as it is to be listening to the music and hitting the rhythm of the beats or specific instruments. That's where the artistic part of this sport comes in -- winning is not only about being the quickest or strongest.\n\nWith a play-by-play by David \"Kid David\" Shreibman and analysis by Ronnie \"B-Boy Ronnie\" Abaldonado, NBC's Olympics coverage should have enough commentary to help explain any concepts that might not be as obvious to a newbie, like how difficult a specific footwork sequence is or whether that breaker had good form when they were upside down doing a head spin on the floor.\n\nThe United States has two B-girls and two B-boys battling at the Olympics this year. In the women's event, we've got 35-year-old Sunny \"B-Girl Sunny\" Choi and 21-year-old Logan \"Logistx\" Edra. Victor \"B-Boy Victor\" Montalvo, 30, and Jeffrey \"B-Boy Jeffro\" Louis, 29, will represent Team USA in the men's event. In total, 16 men and 16 women will compete this year, representing more than a dozen countries.\n\nBreaking is becoming an official event six years after a strong showing at the Summer Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It's not on the schedule for L.A. 2028, but there's still hope that a successful introduction in Paris could help it return for the 2032 Games.\n\nAlthough some breakers have expressed concerns that becoming an Olympic event waters down the artistic spirit and culture of street battles and block parties, others see it as a good thing that breaking is going to gain more recognition as a sport on the world stage. \"I think it's needed,\" Toledo says of the event's Olympics debut. \"I'm happy and grateful for the people that are up there doing it.\" Everyone seems to know each other in some way or form in the tight-knit breaking community. (For example, Toledo often practices two to three times a week with Sunny Choi, the B-girl from Queens who was the first woman to qualify for the U.S. breaking team; he also hangs out with B-boy gold-medal favorite Montalvo every time they're at the same events.) As someone who has no Olympic aspirations and organizes community practices and events, judges battles, and competes at the grassroots level, Toledo believes the increased attention on breaking will translate to more opportunities for him, too.\n\nTune in on Peacock or NBCOlympics.com to watch the two-day competition, which will stream live. The current event schedule, with all times in ET, is listed below.\n\nIn New York, there will be a live watch party of the B-girl event at the Ladies of Hip-Hop studio in Queens (and, yes, you're welcome to dance along to music that will be played during commercial breaks).\n\nThe Red Bull BC One Cypher preliminary in New York, an open-to-the-public Saturday event that Toledo helped organize, will also carve out time for attendees to watch the Olympic B-boys compete live.\n\nYou can keep watching breaking after the Olympics by spectating at local events, or, for another global showdown, set a reminder for the Red Bull BC One World Final, a long-standing global competition that will take place this year on December 7 in Rio de Janeiro (it's historically been available to stream live on social media). If you feel inspired to start learning how to break, Toledo says many dance studios offer introductory programs that teach the basics in a class setting. In New York, there are also several weekly practice sessions that are open to all. Toledo recommends stopping by 360 Flow Studio on Mondays at 8 p.m., Cypher Studio on Tuesdays at 7:30 p.m., and the Williamsburg Community Center on Wednesdays and Fridays at 6:30 p.m.\n\n\"It can be intimidating to hang out around practitioners who have done this for years, but the cool thing about this community is everyone's very helpful and always wants you to be comfortable,\" he says. \"If you want to be in the corner and try to learn things, just let us know.\"", "source": {"uri": "vulture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vulture"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_zhan@vulture.com",

The b-girls will be the first to battle each other, one-by-one, first through a round-robin phase. They'll follow rules based on the Trivium judging system, which asks judges to evaluate breakers on their technique, vocabulary or variety, execution, musicality and originality.\n\nLike gymnastics, breakers have certain moves and tricks they work to land with precision and focus, but they'll also need to emphasize their style, personality and individuality as they sync to the beat of the DJ's soundtrack.\n\nThe elements of style and individuality play out from what the dancers wear, to their \"signature moves,\" to their b-boy or b-girl names themselves. No other Olympic sport has the structure of identifying the competitors this way, but it's a part of preserving the culture and essence of hip-hop in the art form, said Zack Slusser, vice president of Breaking for Gold USA and USA Dance.\n\n\"People coming into breaking need to understand that there's a history here of expression, especially from where it comes from,\" said Slusser. Hip-hop was born as a youth culture within Black and brown communities in the Bronx as a way to escape strife and socio-economic struggles and make a statement of empowerment at a time when they were labeled as lost, lawless kids by New York politicians.\n\nA statement of individuality\n\n\"Hip-hop is about building that individuality and that style, that character. You just want to make sure your presence is known,\" said American Jeffrey Louis, or \"b-boy Jeffro,\" who compared b-boy style to a signature on a document.\n\n\"Your signature is your stamp of approval ... your presence is known. And if you look good and you feel good, of course, you're probably going to perform well, so it all ties into that performance.\"\n\nBeyond the athletics, it's about identity, self-expression, personality and charisma, and the breakers will be bearing it all on stage for the judges to evaluate and the audience to receive.\n\n\"I feel like I've been able to tap into different eras,\" said Logan Edra, or \"b-girl Logistx,\" from Team USA. \"My style is infinite. I tap into different styles and I have different portals that I'm able to channel through for my style and for my breaking.\"\n\nFor Dominika Banevi\u010d, or \"b-girl Nicka\", from Lithuania, it was important to familiarize herself with the origins of the dance and the moves the original breakers from the 1970s were hitting. The 17-year-old is one of the youngest breakers on the roster, but she values tradition above all.\n\n\"The beauty of breaking is to develop your own style ... but you have to learn the foundation really well. Learn the basics first, then you can come up with your own style,\" she said.\n\nBreaking competition begins\n\nThe b-girls will start Friday with a pre-qualifier between India Sardjoe of the Netherlands, or \"b-girl India,\" against the refugee team's Manizha Talash, or \"b-girl Talash,\" who is originally from Afghanistan and sought asylum in Spain. Talash was a late addition to the Olympic roster -- she missed registration for any qualifying breaking events, but her story of breaking and defying the strict rule of the Taliban in her home country captured the attention of the International Olympic Committee executive board, and she was invited to participate.\n\nBreaking is not in the lineup of sports for the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, and Slusser said he's skeptical it'll make it into the events for Brisbane in 2032. It all comes down to funding.\n\n\"It was a miracle that we were even in Paris to begin with,\" he said. But for the breaking community, it's an achievement worth celebrating, even if it doesn't return to the Olympic stage.\n\nIn the end, breakers from the U.S. and around the world are hoping their debut at the Olympics leads to visibility and more resources for the breaking community through stakeholders and financial gains.\n\n\"The amount of exposure to the right people that can bring real change to our community, to our platform to help it grow -- it'll be significant to us. It'll allow us, for the first time, to find sustainability and help us elevate our platform,\" Slusser said.\n\n\"It would be great to see breaking make it back to the Olympic Games again. But at the same time, it's really going to go back to community work and leveraging this opportunity internally.\" ___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games",

For two days just before the close of the Games, competitors will showcase dizzying feats of athleticism and gravity-defying stunts in 60-second blasts of dance.\n\nBreaking - sometimes known as breakdancing, although that term is now considered obsolete - is a style of street dance with its origins in the United States in the 1970s, particularly among African American and Latino communities in New York. Characterised by acrobatic moves and complex footwork performed to funk, breakbeats and hip-hop, it is one of the original four disciplines of hip-hop, along with DJing, graffiti, and MCing.\n\nIn competitions, breakers take part in dance \"battles\", in which dancers take turns to show off their best moves. Vitally, every dance is different, there is no routine to follow, and b-boys and b-girls have no idea what they will be breaking to. The DJ alone dictates the music, setting the tone and pace for each battle while an MC - the master of ceremonies - hypes up the crowd and make sure the energy is pulsing.\n\nBreaking was introduced at the Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires in 2018, massively boosting its popularity and leading the way to its inclusion in Paris 2024.\n\nBreaking will take place over two days, with women competing on Friday 9 August, while the men will do battle on Saturday 10. Battles will happen at the Parc Urbain, built around the Place de La Concorde. The heart of Paris' centre for urban sport and culture, it will also host 3\u00d73 basketball, street and park skateboarding and BMX freestyle.\n\nThose taking part are not known as competitors, athletes or even dancers, but b-boys and b-girls - and are often known only by the b-boy or b-girl name. There will be 32 in total, 16 b-girls and 16 b-boys.\n\nThere is a round robin stage, where the 16 breakers are split into four groups and dance, for a minute each, against everyone in their group. The two best from each group progress to the knockouts. Most major breaking competitions have two or three throw downs in each battle, increasing to five in the final.\n\nA panel of judges score each round and each battle, marking breakers' performances based on five criteria, each worth 20% of the final score..\n\nTechnique: Scores are based on athleticism, body control, dynamics, space control, form, lines and shape, as well as whether certain moves have been executed correctly.\n\nVocabulary: The variation and quantity of moves, with a diverse set of moves in multiple positions needed for a top score.\n\nExecution: Essentially how \"clean\" a move is, and how distinct one move is from the next. They should flow, but not blend.\n\nMusicality: It's a dance, not a routine - judges will be looking at how the breaker feels and express the music.\n\nOriginality: The wow moment, how is the breaker making the dance their own.\n\nUnlike other judged sports, breakers face off in one-on-one battles to see who's best - there is no leaderboard.\n\nInstead of giving each criteria a score, judges - usually respected members of the breaking community - use a digital slider to slide towards a breaker in each category.\n\nThere are too many to count, but breakers combine three basic elements into their routine:\n\nToprock: Moves made while the breaker is standing up, consisting mainly of hand movements and nimble footwork. Most throw downs start with toprock - in breaking's roots, it was used as a way to tell other dancers to get out of the way.\n\nDownrock: Perhaps the moves most associated with breaking, performed on the floor. Breakers will spin on practically any part of their bodies at lightning speed, combining the moves with crafted footwork, drops and transitions.\n\nFreeze: When a breaker performs a total stop - usually in an acrobatic, seemingly impossible position, often signifying the end of a sequence.\n\nYou'd better believe it.

What to know about breaking", "body": "Breaking, more commonly known as breakdancing, is making its grand debut as an olympic sport in Paris.\n\nBreaking's roots can be traced to the Bronx where it emerged in the 70s from Black and brown youth and has since expanded to a multi-billion dollar global industry.\n\nThis dance form is known for its athleticism and is closely tied to hip-hop culture, characterised by a combination of athletic moves (think spins and flips).\n\nThe dance spread across the world and international competitions began in the 1990s.\n\nIn the basement of a sports complex in Paris, dozens of breakers, gathered almost every weeknight in July to freestyle. They warmed up with footwork - \"toprocking\" - and catching the beat before diving into floor moves. Samy Vongphrachanh, 19, was cheered on by a peer when he took risks and encouraged when he couldn't quite land a power move.\n\nThey are part of Paris' local breaking and hip-hop community.\n\n\"We come, we chill, we cypher - it's like the main essence of breaking,\" said Vongphrachanh, referring to the informal circle formed by breakers in which they enter one by one to dance and battle. \"It's sharing peace, unity, love and having fun.\"\n\nBreaking is making its olympic debut Friday with women's breaking which gets underway at 10 a.m. ET with qualifying rounds. Men's breaking will take place Saturday.\n\nOne of the B-Girls who will be participating is New York's own Sunny Choi.\n\nThe Queens, New York, native who spent time in Philadelphia at the University of Pennsylvania participating in breaking as the sport makes its Olympic debut isn't lost on her.\n\nThe sport (and dance form) has made big strides to spin its way to this point.\n\n\"I have so much gratitude and pride to be able to represent for our community,\" Choi told reporters in Paris.\n\n\"We came from the streets in Black and brown communities,\" the 35-year-old American told reporters. \"Breaking has really kind of globalized and now we have this extremely beautifully-diverse world.\"\n\nChoi explained that part of the popularity of breaking, comes from the fact that it is more accessible compared to other sports that could be costlier to practice.\n\n\"Breaking is a lot more accessible than a lot of other sports and art forms that are out there, you really just need a dance floor, some music,\" Choi said.\n\nJudges at the Olympics will score B-Girls and B-Boys based on the Trivium judging system, which scores breakers on creativity, personality, technique, variety, performativity and musicality. The scores can fluctuate throughout the battle, based on how breakers respond to their opponents.\n\nIn all, 32 breakers - 16 women and 16 men - will compete over two days, Aug. 9 and 10, at the iconic Place de la Concorde, a public square in Paris that is being transformed into an open-air stadium for the Olympics. The outdoor venue is meant to be a nod to the culture of street battles in breaking.\n\nThe Paris Games could be their only shot at an Olympic medal -- breaking won't be one of the sports at the Los Angeles Games in 2028.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_rap", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle rap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diving (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breakdancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footwork_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Footwork (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Pennsylvania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivium_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trivium (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_de_la_Concorde", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Place de la Concorde"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Globalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Dance", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Dance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Circus", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Circus", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/08/Breaking-Comcast-Plaza.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801468", "eventUri": "eng-9801468", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "dateEnd": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 2667, "textEnd": 2680}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

They move their feet at lightning speeds, then seconds later strike a pose, holding their bodies off the ground with one hand. They twirl, leap and spin, they flip, fall and float, and they can be both rhythmically robotic and athletically acrobatic.\n\nThe style of dance is called breaking. And it's about to step onto a whole new stage.\n\nFor the first time, breaking - known outside the culture as breakdancing - will be making an appearance in the Summer Olympics in Paris, with the women's competition scheduled for Friday and the men's events slated for Saturday.\n\nA total of 32 breakers (16 men and 16 women, known as B-boys and B-girls) from 16 countries will be going for gold as a dance style with 50 years of history unfolds in front of an international audience.\n\nAnd as the breaking community eagerly awaits what's to come, the breakers who have cultivated and carried on the culture in Maine are just as intrigued by how it will look.\n\n\"Never in a million years did I think (we) could break dance and be in the Olympics and get a gold medal to represent the United States,\" said Will Bruno, a 43-year-old breaker living in Biddeford who dances under the name Will Trix. \"That's such an accomplishment for the culture.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat culture is hip-hop, and breaking - along with rapping, DJing and graffiti art - has been central since the 1970s. And the dance element carries a lot of meaning for the breakers who perform it. For them, breaking isn't as much of an activity as a style of life, and a means for expression.\n\n\"This is my way I make friends, this is the way I meet new people, this is what I do on weekends for fun. If I'm going to New York City, I'm going because there's a break event there,\" said Josh Wright, a 33-year-old breaker and instructor from Portland who goes by the name Starstriker. \"It kind of drives my life.\"\n\nHe's not alone.\n\n\"You can't just be like, 'Oh, I'll do this for an hour a day.' You're in it,\" Will Trix said. \"And when you're not in it, you're looking at B-boy videos, you're watching hip hop dancers, you're engulfed in the culture itself. ... Even at their jobs, they're like, 'Oh, man, today's a rough day, but I can't wait until I get out and get with the boys and start breaking, and let all of this out.'\"\n\n***\n\nThe Olympic competitions (or battles) will feature one-on-one showdowns between dancers. A DJ will spin music and each dancer will perform a routine to it, one after the other, with the routine consisting of breaking's main elements: toprock (dance steps made while upright), drops (moves the breaker makes to go to the ground), footwork (moves the breaker makes while on the ground), power moves (the dynamic spins in which they show off their strength) and freezes (pauses during which the breaker holds a pose).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the routine, breakers will try to impress the nine-judge panel - and ignite the crowd - with jaw-dropping feats. They'll contort their bodies, move two ways at once, land on their heads and carry their body weight on their fingertips. They'll tap their feet like Fred Astaire, or moonwalk like Michael Jackson.\n\n\"The people (watching) for the first time are going to say, 'I can't believe the human body can do that,'\" said Pete \"Nonstop\" Vitello, 44, of Biddeford, a Brooklyn native who Wright said was key to introducing and spreading breaking culture in Maine. \"B-boys have adapted and have heightened their levels so much that the Olympics are going to be like no other. Even B-boys don't even know what to expect. I'm telling you, people are moving like you wouldn't believe today.\"\n\nJudges will critique the breakers on a variety of criteria, including the smoothness and complexity of their motion, the originality of the moves, and the degree to which it's synced to the music.\n\n\"First off, do you have foundation? If you're doing all this dance stuff, does it look like you've done it before, or does it look like you're making it up and trying to pretend?\" said Bruce \"Thunder\" Tracy, 48, of Portland, who has been teaching dance since 1995. \"They're looking for scoring on originality and flavor. ... Do they intrigue you? Do they create drama within their dance, do they tell a story? Do they make you feel anything?\n\n\"There are some guys that come out and wow you with moves, and there are some guys that come out and wow you with your presence. The guys that have both are the ones you have to watch out for.\"\n\nPart of the mystery surrounding the Olympic debut will be how the tone and atmosphere of a breaking battle on the streets or in a club translates to Paris. When breakers face off, it's a confrontation. Winning tactics include mind games, intimidation, and tricks to get under a dancer's skin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You've got to remember, this is almost like an underground fight club,\" Starstriker said. \"We get to battles and we wait for the battle to happen, and after the battle happens, then everybody is cool. But before that, it's like looking at stray dogs across the alley.\"\n\nInteraction and response is part of the game. A breaker who doesn't properly execute the fall to the ground will hear his opponent taunt him for \"crashing.\" Copying a move from another breaker will result in an accusation of \"biting the move,\" signaled by the opponent putting one forearm on top of the other.\n\n\"There's a bunch of trash talk that happens,\" Thunder said. \"That element can get in your head. How's that going to play out in the Olympics?\"\n\nThere's also a curiosity, and even a concern, among breakers about how a form of artistic expression can be fairly evaluated with points, and whether a push to win a competition will come at the expense of the emotion and feeling that's at the heart of the break.\n\n\"It's either going to be watered down and we're all going to hate it, and the rest of the world's going to be like, 'This is great, they're spinning on their heads,'\" Thunder said, \"or we're going to really get to show them what the thing looks like in its truest form.\"\n\n***\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fears are justified. Breakers are proud of the culture behind the dance, and of how it allows them ways to express themselves. Starstriker said breaking pulled him out of a life of petty crime as a kid. Nonstop said it gave his life direction after he was homeless in New York.\n\nFor B-boys and B-girls, breaking is something they know belongs to them. It's why the term \"breakdancing,\" an outsiders' word, gets scoffed at. And it's why nearly all breakers use an alias. It allows them to transform on the floor, and sink into that transformation.\n\n\"When I'm on the floor, I'm not Joshua Wright anymore, I don't have to worry about his problems,\" Starstriker said. \"I'm Starstriker B-boy. ... You can take on that other persona.\"\n\nWhat they're excited about, however, is what the Olympic exposure will do to an art form that has already started to see an uptick in public popularity.\n\n\"It's rare to find a dance studio that offers a breaking class at this point, but I have a feeling that's going to change,\" said Elizabeth Lau, the community programs director at Portland Youth Dance. \"Ten years ago, maybe a class was five to 10, tops. (Starstriker's) class this summer was 18 with a wait list.\"\n\nBreaking in Maine is still largely limited to Greater Portland, but its imprint on the state isn't going away. Lau started The Exchange, an annual event that brings hip-hop dancers to Portland for battles. And Will Trix is organizing the Hip Hop Summit, which will take place Aug. 31 at Congress Square Park and feature battles, rappers, DJs and graffiti artists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the Olympics offering its stage, breaking could get its biggest boost yet.\n\n\"It's about to blow up,\" Thunder said.\n\nBreakers themselves would be happy to see it.\n\n\"This is something that's around, this is something that happens, and it's something that can take you around the world,\" Starstriker said. \"And you can learn it in your driveway.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the

Here's how it works", "body": "Every four years, the Summer Olympics shine a spotlight on some of the oldest known sports - events like track and field or wrestling, whose roots date back more than a century.\n\nBut in recent years, the Olympics have also featured new, exciting sports too. And that's where breaking comes in.\n\nBreaking, more commonly known as breakdancing, is part of the new wave of sports that the International Olympic Committee has ushered in as part of a broader effort to appeal to younger fans and add an urban flair to the Summer Games. It follows the addition of sports such as skateboarding and surfing, which debuted at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\n\nBreaking is the only new sport at the 2024 Paris Olympics, and it has not been included in the initial sports program for the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.\n\nThat means breaking could very well be a one-and-done sport in the Olympics.\n\nAt the Olympics, the men's and women's breaking competitions will consist of a series of one-on-one battles, with each B-boy or B-girl trying to impress a panel of nine judges by executing a variety of moves. There are multiple rounds per battle, and in each round, competitors will try to land power moves - acrobatic spins, flips and the like - while also mixing in what is called \"top rocking,\" or dance elements performed while upright. They're also judged on criteria such as \"musicality\" and \"vocabulary,\" which reflect how they interact with the music.\n\nThough hip-hop is the soundtrack for every battle, competitors don't know ahead of time what style or tempo of music the DJ will play during each round. The top performers are able to both practice and prepare specific combinations of moves, but then adapt to the style of the music. Creativity is one of the key criteria for judging, which is fairly subjective.\n\nVictor Montalvo, who competes as B-boy Victor, qualified for Paris by winning the 2023 world championships in Belgium. He's been competing for more than a decade and is widely considered to be one of the top competitive breakers in the world. B-boy Jeffro will be the other American man in the field after he nabbed a late qualifying spot.\n\nSunny Choi (or B-girl Sunny) and Logan Edra (or B-girl Logistx) will represent Team USA on the women's side. Choi won the 2023 Pan American Games, while Edra has had past success in Red Bull's international breaking competition, BC One.\n\nBreaking was born in the Bronx in New York, so it should come as no surprise that the U.S. is one of the sport's dominant powers. But Japan, led by veteran B-boy Shigekix, is also consistently toward the top of the pack and figures to win at least one breaking medal in Paris. Canada, China, France and the Netherlands could also see their competitors in the medal mix.\n\nThe breaking competitions at the 2024 Paris Games will all be televised live on E!, with the women's competition slated to begin at 10:30 a.m. ET on Friday and conclude with the finals, which start at 2 p.m. ET. The men's competition will take place at the same times Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's Going to Be Intense.", "body": "Why it's called \"breaking\" and not \"breakdancing,\" how it will be scored, and more.\n\nWe're now more than halfway through the 2024 Summer Olympics, and while the staple sports such as swimming and gymnastics have been completed, Paris still has a lot left in store. Anticipation is particularly high when it comes to breaking, the Games' newest sport. Breaking, also known as breakdancing, may ring a bell to anyone who was around in the '80s: the intricate footwork, the physics-defying stunts, the style. But the art form has developed since its earlier days -- people aren't carrying cardboard boxes around anymore, though parachute pants have certainly made a strong comeback. On Friday, this style of dance will make its debut at the Paris Olympics, with women athletes (also known as b-girls) competing first, followed by the men, or b-boys, on Saturday. The action will take place at the Place de la Concorde, Paris' largest public square and the Olympics' cool-kid corner, where the other \"urban\" events -- BMX, skateboarding, etc. -- have taken place.\n\nWith the introduction of any Olympic sport, a lot of questions arise: How did this event arrive at the Olympics, and why does it feel at least four decades too late? How can you standardize something that's judged differently at various tournaments around the world? And why isn't this sport, which has drawn enough hype that even Snoop Dogg is excited for it, returning for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics? Here's everything you need to know about breaking at the Olympics.\n\nI thought it was called \"breakdancing\"? Why do they call it \"breaking\"?\n\nWhile it might seem like a new term, breakdancing has actually always -- and originally -- been referred to as breaking. The counterculture hip-hop dance form, which emerged from Black and Latino communities in the Bronx of New York City in the 1970s, was born when people would dance to a \"break\" in a track played at parties and gatherings. This was the dawn of hip-hop music, identifiable by both the reliance on a loop of a sample and then the satisfying break -- an instrumental interlude when everything but the hefty percussion drops out -- in a track. Then, hip-hop pioneers found ways to extend the break, which meant extended breaking on the dance floor. As b-boy and hip-hop historian Alien Ness attests in an episode of Vox's Today, Explained podcast, \"once you start extending the break, you have the birth of hip-hop music.\" The concept is somewhat evident in this clip in the classic 1984 film Beat Street: You can hear the DJ switch to a sample with no vocals, and then continue to mix the part of the track that is solely percussion -- that's the break. The term \"breakdancing\" was used commercially to explain the art form to the masses, but the original term is preferred by dancers and is seen as a more direct and respectful nod to the birth of hip-hop culture. As Team USA b-girl Sunny Choi put it to Time: \"If you call it breakdancing, you're not a breaker.\"\n\nSo, how will breaking work on the Olympic stage?\n\nBreaking will undergo a bracket-style order of operations. There will be two separate competitions for men and women, with 16 b-boys and 16 b-girls (though there will be a pre-qualifying battle between the 17- and 16-seed b-girls before the main event begins). The dancers will be placed into four groups of four that will go head-to-head in solo battles in a round-robin, meaning that, in these groups, every athlete will face off against every other athlete at least once (meaning: three battles per athlete in a group of four). Each battle will consist of three rounds, also called \"throw downs,\" where one breaker will get 60 seconds to improvise some moves to previously unheard music chosen by a DJ before the other competitor gets a chance to immediately respond with their own 60-second throw down. Whoever wins the best of the three rounds, per the judges' scoring system, wins the battle.\n\nThe two best breakers of each group will then move on to the quarterfinals, or the \"knockout\" stage, where they will be seeded into a bracket, with the lower seed facing off against the higher seed. From there, it works like a usual bracket where the winner of the battle moves on to the next round.\n\nSounds simple enough, but how will it be judged? Is it kind of like gymnastics?\n\nNot at all: There is no set routine planned out beforehand, so, unlike in gymnastics, there is no agreed degree of difficulty for a given routine. But, before I get into what the judges are looking for, I need to explain what they'll be looking at. The World DanceSport Federation has designated three main elements of breaking: the top rock (this generally refers to all moves performed while the breaker is standing, which usually means intricate footwork); the freeze (when an athlete holds a pose in an unusual position, like on their head or hands, during their performance); and the down rock (all parts of the performance that occur on the floor). The down rock holds the most identifiable parts of breakdancing -- power moves like headspins, airflares, and windmills.\n\nNine judges will look out for five WDSF-created criteria that each count for 20 percent of the final score: technique, vocabulary, execution, musicality, and originality. Technique involves certain moves having specific criteria, such as flexing or pointing your toes, but will also include the judges' perception of the breakers' athleticism, form, spatial awareness, and so forth. Vocabulary means that the dancers should aim to perform a variety of moves in multiple positions -- meaning you'd want a good combo of top rock and down rock. Execution will hinge on how cleanly the moves are done and how distinct each move is from the one before and after it -- the overall routine should flow, but not blur together. This is crucial, because there's an art to the build of a breaking composition, which usually moves like a narrative, accelerating up to an explosive action punctuated by a freeze. Good execution also involves not falling, or \"crashing,\" of course. Finally, musicality and originality are a given -- it still is a competitive dance form, after all.\n\nThe judges will use sliders to indicate their scores, showing audiences how one dancer might be outperforming another in a specific category. The result will be one vote from each judge per round, in favor of either competitor, derived from their given percentages. The odd number of judges prevents the event of a tie.\n\nBut enough with the cold calculations. The important thing to note is that breaking is about a combination of style and technicality. According to ESPN, \"the moves must be adapted to their personal styles and improvised to music in order to secure each judge's vote.\" This is why the improvisational element is key: You're literally responding to your opponent -- if they have an airflare, but you have a more intricate variation, you're likely going to throw it out.\n\nSounds intense! Are there deductions? I'm sure battling one-on-one can get heated.\n\nDance battling is a gritty space that definitely gets heated from time to time. Though braggadocio is encouraged and respected between dancers, each judge will have three \"misbehavior buttons\" categorizing any as mild, moderate, severe. A mild misbehavior, consisting of accidents and unintentional actions, will result in a 3-percent point deduction; moderate misbehaviors, consisting of intentional nonviolent acts, will result in a 6-percent point deduction; and severe misbehaviors -- intentional acts that are aggressive, violent, or sexual in nature -- will result in a 10-percent point deduction.\n\nThis all sounds really cool! I'm sure everyone in the dance community is happy about this.\n\nThe story of how breaking got into the Olympics is fascinating -- it involves the governing body known as the International DanceSport Federation rebranding as the WDSF and bringing in a former International Olympic Committee veteran consultant to help them get dance into the Olympics, and following that consultant's recommendation to shift the organization's focus from ballroom and Latin dancing to its unsung dynamic gem: breaking. It wasn't until the WDSF -- which is still trying to get ballroom and Latin dancing into the Games, by the way -- got breaking into the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in Argentina, where it became a social media hit, that the IOC was unable to ignore the sport anymore.\n\nStill, as is to be expected, there are mildly annoying classists who argue that breaking is not a sport (unlike, say, something like squash). But they're not the only ones with reservations: Even some original breakers have expressed worries over cheapening and turning their art into a codified sport. Naturally, there was always going to be a question of how this form of expression -- which is judged or regarded differently from tournament to tournament -- can maintain its authenticity when parsed into standardized judgeable components. Take Ken Swift, an original member of the Rock Steady Crew, who told Sports Illustrated that \"it's not a sport,\" but \"an art form that we created with our own terminology and heritage and tradition,\" likening its burgeoning identity as a sport to calling \"basketball a dance now after 75 years.\" In 2017, more than 2,000 people even signed breaker Serouj Aprahamian's petition to stop the sport's inclusion in the games and the WDSF's attempts to push it there.\n\nThere's also concern that breaking's wide popularity could leave the people who founded it behind. The New York City Rap Tour brought breaking to other international cities, like Paris, in the early '80s. But in the late '80s and early '90s, breaking fell out of fashion when the era of gangsta rap started to define hip-hop culture. Around that time, international dance festivals and tournaments started to pop up: one of the most well known, Battle of the Year, started in Germany in 1990, while Red Bull started hosting competitions in 2001. Given the dance's universality, the top dancers to watch at this year's Games come from all around the world, not just from the places with deep cultural ties to breaking. As Imani Kai Johnson, an associate dance professor at the University of California, Riverside, put it to Time: \"My investment is in hip-hop as a culture with Africanist aesthetic foundations, and not as a sport that is increasingly detached from any cultural context.\" Similarly, b-girl Sunny Choi warns competitors and watchers to not forget the sport's origins: \"Breaking comes from Black and brown communities in the Bronx. When it goes to the Olympics, we know those aren't the ones who are going to get all the money. I think it's our responsibility, as the first breakers who go, to be mindful of this.\"\n\nOn the flipside, plenty are excited for breaking to get the massive global exposure that the Olympics is known to grant lesser-known athletic heroes. It's been a long time coming: People have been petitioning for breaking to be considered an Olympic sport since the '80s, when a group of breakers joined Lionel Richie for the closing ceremony performance at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.\n\nAs for b-boys, all eyes are on Japan's Shigekix, 22, one of Japan's flag bearers at the opening ceremony, who is seeded at the top spot and has been name-dropped by plenty of breakers as the one to watch out for. The other breaker seen as a strong contender is Canada's Phil Wizard, 27, seeded second. Team USA's b-boy Jeffro, 29, is seeded third, though USA's Victor Montalvo, 30, only seeded eighth, is also considered to be a top competitor, having won the 2023 world title. The hometown favorite might be France's Dany Dann, 36, seeded seventh. And, like b-girl Nicka, Australia's 15 seed, b-boy J Attack, is only 16 years old.\n\nGosh, well I can't wait for the sport to be back on its home turf in the USA for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics!\n\nIndeed. Since 2020, every hosting city has been allowed to bring new sports into their games. The Los Angeles planning committee shortlisted breaking, cricket, baseball and softball, flag football, lacrosse, karate, kickboxing, squash, and motorsport. In the end, the five that were chosen are cricket, lacrosse, flag football, squash, and softball/baseball. This means that breaking's Olympic run was cut short before it even had a chance to prove itself. However, breaking will still be a part of the 2026 Youth Olympic Games in Dakar, and the slate for the 2032 Brisbane Olympics will be decided by 2027, meaning breaking still has a chance to rear its head(spin) again.", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nadira_goffe@slate.com", "name": "Nadira Goffe", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Rules explained", "body": "Doing so is an effort by the International Olympic Committee to modernise the Games, attract new and younger audiences and give athletes from smaller or emerging sports to showcase their talent to the world.\n\nAt Paris 2024, the sole debutant among the sports to be contested is known by a somewhat obscure name: breaking.\n\nWith roots in 1970s New York, breaking joins several other urban sports in the Paris 2024 event line-up, including skateboarding and BMX freestyle.\n\nBut just what does the Olympics' newest sport actually involve?\n\nRadioTimes.com breaks it all down, including the rules of the sport at the Paris 2024 Olympics.\n\nDon't miss a minute of the Games with our complete 16-day Olympics TV Guide download, including how to watch all the action on TV, online, on catch-up and on the radio.\n\nRead more: Olympics TV coverage | Olympics radio coverage | Olympics presenters and commentators\n\nBreaking is a style of street dance which originated in 1970s New York City.\n\nThe sport can be traced back to the New York borough of the Bronx in the early 1970s, where the dance style began to grow at events like block parties in tandem with the increasing popularity of the hip-hop genre of music.\n\nThe 'break' is the part of a song where vocals and other instruments fade out, leaving just the percussion - and it is in that break that early b-boys and b-girls (male and female competitors who practice the sport of breaking) began to showcase their acrobatic moves and quick footwork set to the backing of the hip-hop soundtrack.\n\nAs breaking's popularity spread, more communities and cultures got involved, forming crews to face off in both individual and team dance battles and leading to the first international breaking competitions starting up back in the 1990s.\n\nBreaking first featured at an Olympic event in 2018 when it was included at the Summer Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nIt was its success there that led to its addition to the event line-up for Paris 2024.\n\nIn Paris, the breaking competition is split into a men's event and a women's event.\n\nThe competition will see 16 b-boys and 16 b-girls face off in one-on-one battles consisting of three 60-second throw downs (the term for when a b-boy or b-girl hits the floor and starts breaking), where they must adapt their style and improvise to the beat of the DJ's tracks in a bid to secure votes from five judges.\n\nThe athletes take turns to showcase their routines, with popular moves including the 6-step, toprock, windmill and freeze, as well as flips and even dancers spinning on their head.\n\nTheir performances are judged on five criteria - technique, vocabulary (the variety of their moves), execution, musicality and originality - with the judges sliding a digital slider towards the dancer who is winning the head-to-head battle based on each of them.\n\nEach of the five criteria accounts for 20 per cent of the competitor's final score, with the winner of the round decided based on the average of the five criteria sliders.\n\nThe breaking competition at Paris 2024 will take place at the Place de la Concorde, with the women's event on 9th August followed by the men's event on 10th August.\n\nThe b-boys and b-girls are divided into groups of four for an initial round-robin stage, battling all the other breakers in their group to decide which two progress to the quarter-finals.\n\nThe eight quarter-finalists are then seeded into one-on-one single elimination (lose and you're out) battles based on their previous performance (for example, first versus eighth, second versus seventh).\n\nThis process is repeated for the semi-finals and the finals to crown the inaugural Olympic breaking champions.\n\n2023 world champions Victor Montalvo, of the United States, and Lithuania's Dominika Banevi\u010d (better known as B-Girl Nicka) were the first two competitors to book their places for Paris.", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_dakers@radiotimes.com", "name": "Alex Dakers", "type": "author", "isAgency":

The b-girls will be the first to battle each other, one-by-one, first through a round-robin phase. They'll follow rules based on the Trivium judging system, which asks judges to evaluate breakers on their technique, vocabulary or variety, execution, musicality and originality.\n\nLike gymnastics, breakers have certain moves and tricks they work to land with precision and focus, but they'll also need to emphasize their style, personality and individuality as they sync to the beat of the DJ's soundtrack.\n\nThe elements of style and individuality play out from what the dancers wear, to their \"signature moves,\" to their b-boy or b-girl names themselves. No other Olympic sport has the structure of identifying the competitors this way, but it's a part of preserving the culture and essence of hip-hop in the art form, said Zack Slusser, vice president of Breaking for Gold USA and USA Dance.\n\n\"People coming into breaking need to understand that there's a history here of expression, especially from where it comes from,\" said Slusser. Hip-hop was born as a youth culture within Black and brown communities in the Bronx as a way to escape strife and socio-economic struggles and make a statement of empowerment at a time when they were labeled as lost, lawless kids by New York politicians.\n\nA statement of individuality\n\n\"Hip-hop is about building that individuality and that style, that character. You just want to make sure your presence is known,\" said American Jeffrey Louis, or \"b-boy Jeffro,\" who compared b-boy style to a signature on a document.\n\n\"Your signature is your stamp of approval ... your presence is known. And if you look good and you feel good, of course, you're probably going to perform well, so it all ties into that performance.\"\n\nBeyond the athletics, it's about identity, self-expression, personality and charisma, and the breakers will be bearing it all on stage for the judges to evaluate and the audience to receive.\n\n\"I feel like I've been able to tap into different eras,\" said Logan Edra, or \"b-girl Logistx,\" from Team USA. \"My style is infinite. I tap into different styles and I have different portals that I'm able to channel through for my style and for my breaking.\"\n\nFor Dominika Banevi\u010d, or \"b-girl Nicka\", from Lithuania, it was important to familiarize herself with the origins of the dance and the moves the original breakers from the 1970s were hitting. The 17-year-old is one of the youngest breakers on the roster, but she values tradition above all.\n\n\"The beauty of breaking is to develop your own style ... but you have to learn the foundation really well. Learn the basics first, then you can come up with your own style,\" she said.\n\nBreaking competition begins\n\nThe b-girls will start Friday with a pre-qualifier between India Sardjoe of the Netherlands, or \"b-girl India,\" against the refugee team's Manizha Talash, or \"b-girl Talash,\" who is originally from Afghanistan and sought asylum in Spain. Talash was a late addition to the Olympic roster -- she missed registration for any qualifying breaking events, but her story of breaking and defying the strict rule of the Taliban in her home country captured the attention of the International Olympic Committee executive board, and she was invited to participate.\n\nThe b-boys take the stage Saturday.\n\nBreaking's Olympic future is murky\n\nBreaking is not in the lineup of sports for the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, and Slusser said he's skeptical it'll make it into the events for Brisbane in 2032. It all comes down to funding.\n\n\"It was a miracle that we were even in Paris to begin with,\" he said. But for the breaking community, it's an achievement worth celebrating, even if it doesn't return to the Olympic stage.\n\nIn the end, breakers from the U.S. and around the world are hoping their debut at the Olympics leads to visibility and more resources for the breaking community through stakeholders and financial gains.\n\n\"The amount of exposure to the right people that can bring real change to our community, to our platform to help it grow -- it'll be significant to us. It'll allow us, for the first time, to find sustainability and help us elevate our platform,\" Slusser said.\n\n\"It would be great to see breaking make it back to the Olympic Games again. But at the same time, it's really going to go back to community work and leveraging this opportunity internally.\" ___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nDenver

And don't pardon the pun, it was absolutely intended.\n\nThere are four elements to look for in the breaking competition:\n\nHow a breaker starts their dance, while still standing, before going to the floor.\n\nIt's an introduction to the dancer and their style, before they launch onto the floor into their footwork and other moves.\n\nAlso known as \"downrock\", these are moves done on the ground, with support from hands, as the breaker moves their legs through a variety of steps.\n\nDynamic moves that highlight acrobatics and strength, using repetitive, circular movements, including head spins, air flares and windmills.\n\nA static position when a breaker hits and holds a move for a few seconds.\n\nIt's most appreciated when it's synced up with a particular beat or sound in the music.\n\nGiven it's the first time this event's been held at the Olympics -- the biggest stage ever for the new sport -- it's really hard to say.\n\nYou can't knock Gunn's credentials. She literally lectures in the history of her chosen field.\n\nGunn did not take up breaking until her mid-20s and stands out among the teenagers qualified to date, who include Lithuanian world champion Dominika Banevic, a 16-year-old who competes as \"B-girl Nicka\".\n\nYet Gunn is far from an anomaly, with American rival Sunny Choi also set to fly the flag for mid-thirties breakers at Paris after giving up a corporate career.\n\nYounger bodies have it easier learning and perfecting \"power moves\", the more acrobatic elements of breaking that often demand speed, strength and momentum, Gunn concedes.\n\nHowever, Gunn is still trying out -- and nailing -- new elements with the help of her husband and coach Samuel Free, a competitive breaker under the name \"Sammy The Free\".\n\n\"It's a different experience. I obviously spend more time warming up, more time in recovery and just make sure I look after my body,\" Gunn said in an interview with Reuters before travelling to Paris.\n\n\"I don't think a 20-year-old needs to worry as much about those things.\"\n\nThis is where things get messy.\n\nBreaking was popular at the Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires in 2018 and drew enthusiastic crowds at its Asian Games debut in China last year.\n\nHowever, its addition to the Olympic program has had its detractors, with cynics dismissing it as a desperate ploy by the International Olympic Committee to attract a younger audience.\n\nSome dancers are also sceptical how breaking's underground roots and street culture fit the commercialised Olympic movement.\n\nThe organisers of the Los Angeles games in 2028 decided against keeping breaking, so all eyes after tonight shift to the potential of Brisbane in 2032.\n\nThough \"Raygun\" can see both sides of the debate, she raves about a highly accessible sport that has become a lot more inclusive and respectful of women since she penned her thesis.\n\n\"They get fit, they get a creative outlet and become part of this community,\" Gunn said.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki",

Breaking offers the Olympics a new beat.", "body": "Mr. Montalvo sees their role as an important one. \"A lot of people talk about breaking losing the essence throughout the years,\" he said at a media event in the spring. \"So I feel like it's up to the newer generation to dig into those roots and then bring that essence back into the dance.\"\n\nBreakers Victor Montalvo and Sunny Choi will soon compete for Team USA at the Summer Olympics in Paris. The No. 1 B-boy and B-girl have been part of the buzz surrounding breaking - word to the wise, do not call it breakdancing - as a sport in the Games for the first time. Breaking was introduced in the Summer Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2018, and the sport's popularity helped push the International Olympic Committee to officially include it for 2024. Among the reasons the IOC chose it: to increase youth engagement.\n\n\"My mind will be blown when I see it on TV,\" says Michael Holman, founder and director of the New York City Breakers, a breaking collective that started in 1982. Mr. Holman wrote a proclamation for breaking to be an Olympic sport in 1984. He was also one of the first to write down official rules for breaking competitions.\n\nMr. Holman says that he first saw the potential for breaking to be a sport because of the athleticism of the crews. They had amazing footwork, he says, but they also had slick power moves - like flares, spins, and windmills.\n\n\"There will be a part of me that feels like I had something to do with this, at least spiritually. I will feel incredible pride,\" Mr. Holman says of the upcoming competition.\n\nBreaking started in New York City in the 1970s. Breaking crews battled one another in front of DJ stands surrounded by crowds. The breakers won or lost a battle based on how loudly the crowd applauded.\n\nBreaking looks much different today from in the 1980s, when it was popularized by movies like \"Beat Street\" or \"Breakin'\" and \"Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo.\" Original breakers emulated soul singer James Brown. Latino youths added a heightened sense of gymnastic movements to the art form, and over time the influence of kung fu movies with swipes and arm movements became a part of it, Mr. Holman says.\n\n\"The music should inspire the moves. The music should be just as important to the moves as the way you wrote the routine and the combinations,\" Mr. Holman emphasizes.\n\nMuch like gymnastics, breaking incorporates physical movement, strength, and skill coordination. It is also a global phenomenon, with European and Asian countries leading the way in hosting tournaments year-round.\n\nA nine-member panel will judge each category, B-boys and B-girls, with 16 competitors in each one.\n\nAthletes perform for one minute, but points won't be deducted if a routine goes a little longer. Each battle is a three-round, rapid-fire competition: When one breaker ends their routine, the next starts up.\n\nWhat makes breaking different from other Olympic sports is that breakers will not be able to choose their own music, and will have to dance to a medley curated by a DJ. Breakers are judged on technique, vocabulary, execution, musicality, and originality. Each category accounts for 20% of the score.\n\n\"Music is the most important thing to us,\" Mr. Montalvo said while meeting with the media in April. \"We have the breaking playlist, but we don't know what the song is. Sometimes you don't like the song, but you gotta go out there and fake it till you make it and act like it's the best,\" he added.\n\nMuch of modern breaking consists of complex power moves: windmills, which feature dancers spinning upside down while their legs kick out in a circle; freezes, in which performers stop with their hands on the floor and with their legs arched back or crossed while staying still; and headspins. The routine is rounded out with footwork and dancing.\n\nMr. Montalvo and U.S. team members will have in mind what routines they bounce and spin to the best, but most importantly, they will be improvisational while they entertain the judges.\n\n\"With breaking you gotta be creative, you gotta have style, you gotta have individuality, you gotta have your own fingerprint,\" he says.\n\nDancers are selected a variety of ways. Mr. Montalvo won a gold medal at the 2023 WDSF World Breaking Championship in Belgium to qualify. Ms. Choi captured gold at the Pan American Games in 2023 to earn her spot on the women's team.\n\nMr. Montalvo started breaking in his hometown near Orlando, Florida, when he was 6 years old. His father and uncle, who learned the art in Mexico in the 1980s, taught him.\n\nMs. Choi learned breaking while in college at the University of Pennsylvania. She has traveled the world and seen the talent of breakers from as young as 5 years old to those in their 30s, like her, or older.\n\n\"I'm trying to match them in soul, who I am, in showing my character about me, myself, and being able to represent my community,\" she says of hip-hop and breaking while at the media event.\n\nNow that breaking will be on a larger stage, Ms. Choi says, it is important that it not get diluted, and that people properly know about and respect the culture. She plans to pay homage to the originators, OGs as they are called, and talk about the culture.\n\nBreaking helps her dig deep into herself and focus when she has moments of depression. \"The better I understand myself, the better I can do out there and the better that I can show up,\" she says.\n\nShe is used to not being able to pick her own music in competitions. If she could choose, though, she leans toward artists ranging from current Grammy-nominated rapper Pusha T to old-school rap group N.W.A. \"It depends on my mood,\" she says, smiling.\n\nMr. Montalvo sees their role as an important one. \"A lot of people talk about breaking losing the essence throughout the years. So I feel like it's up to the newer generation to dig into those roots and then bring that essence back into the dance.\"", "source": {"uri": "csmonitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Dancing surrounded by a circle of fellow breakers, called B-boys and B-girls, in a formation named a cypher is \"an opportunity to show yourself.\"\n\n\"It's kind of like speaking a different language that everybody can understand,\" said Caldwell, who lives in Anne Arundel County. \"It is truly poetry in motion.\"\n\nThat hip-hop language will be broadcast in a new way Friday and Saturday when 17 B-girls and 16 B-boys from countries around the globe face off for the first time at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Snoop Dogg, who has been commentating for NBC, told Vogue it's the event he's most excited to watch. It will be the only new sport to debut this summer.\n\nSome Marylanders anticipate that the spotlight will boost breaking's fame. Already, it's drawing attention to how breaking has changed over the decades.\n\n\"It'll definitely be more popular. That's pretty much a given,\" said Antonio Castillo, a Prince George's County resident who's helped put breaking on a bigger stage. \"But will it last for a long time?\"\n\nBlack and Latino kids started the dance style in the Bronx in the 1970s, and it emerged as a pillar of hip-hop culture. Today, competitions like Red Bull BC One bring together breakers worldwide.\n\nAt the Olympics, four breakers will compete on Team USA: Victor \"B-boy Victor\" Montalvo of Florida, who became the first American ever to qualify last year; Texas' Jeffrey Louis, known as B-boy Jeffro; and B-girls Sunny Choi, from Tennessee, and Logan \"Logistx\" Edra, of California.\n\nThey'll be up against top contenders including Philip \"Phil Wizard\" Kim of Canada; Japan's Shigeyuki \"Shigekix\" Nakarai, Ayumi Fukushima and Ami Yuasa; and Lithuania's Dominika \"Nicka\" Banevic, who are all expected to have a chance of bringing home medals.\n\nSince a DJ gets to pick the tracks, breakers will improvise during battles as judges evaluate them on criteria such as technique, \"vocabulary\" and originality; a 133-page document lays out the World DanceSport Federation \"Breaking for Gold\" rules and regulations.\n\n\"I'm probably going to cry. ... Because for me, I associated breaking with America,\" said Castillo, who encountered it for the first time as a kid in Mexico, where he was born, and started practicing.\n\nIn 2011, he founded the academy that became ALL10 Breaking, which offers classes, camps and workshops in Washington, D.C., and Virginia. He also created the Competitive Breakin' League in 2014 and launched USA Breakin' as a D.C. nonprofit in 2020.\n\nA few years earlier, he started a petition for two slots at the Youth Olympic Games for American breakers. Breaking appeared in the 2018 Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, but without U.S. representation.\n\nThis week, spectators will witness \"the best in the world compete at the highest platform that ever existed for breaking,\" said Castillo, who flew to Paris on Monday.\n\nHis first student in D.C., Isaac \"Fawzy\" Witte, also views the Olympics as a boon for breaking.\n\n\"It's going to bring a lot of attention to breaking, which is really dope,\" said Witte, a 17-year-old Montgomery Blair High School senior who lives in Silver Spring and coaches at ALL10 Breaking.\n\nHe's battled in national competitions -- including last year's Breaking for Gold USA qualifier in New York -- after getting into breaking as a kid \"with a lot of energy and no way to really use it.\"\n\nZoe Kirk, aka B-girl Rage, a senior at Chesapeake High School and a member of Baltimore's Deadly Venoms Crew, also competed in a New York Breaking for Gold USA qualifier in 2022, where she came up against Team USA's Sunny and others. She battled Logistx that same year in Orlando, Florida.\n\n\"I really like her style and the way she does things. And I even like the way she talks positively about learning and experimenting,\" Kirk, 17, said of Logistx.\n\nKirk's parents, Keely and Russ Kirk, own Pasadena's Jamz Dance Studio, which played a part in courting the International Olympic Committee to propel breaking to new heights. She said Team USA has a good chance of winning gold.\n\n\"Breaking is one of those styles that people don't necessarily understand. ... So seeing something like breaking -- like a raw, original style -- in the Olympics, is probably one of the best things that people could see,\" she said. \"It's going to be very intense.\"\n\nThe Olympic stage is undoubtedly a departure from the humbler side of breaking.\n\n\"We're all used to practicing in hallways, on cardboard, in the streets,\" said Matthew \"Match\" Chan, 30, a University of Maryland, College Park computer science Ph.D. student who is the president of the school's B-Terps club.\n\nChan said he's interested in seeing breaking featured more consistently in the Olympics (it won't be included in 2028).\n\n\"It is, to a lot of people, first and foremost a culture. And you want to preserve the community,\" he said. \"I remember ... seeing documentaries when I first started, basically about how breaking and all these other street dances became kind of like a fad. ... And it kind of destroyed the image and the culture a little bit.\"\n\nShawn Stevens, a Jamz Dance Studio instructor and co-founder of the Deadly Venoms Crew, was drawn to the \"outlaw feel\" of breaking in the '90s, back when the venues were Baltimore clubs, including The Paradox and Twilight Zone.\n\nJudging USA Breakin' and Competitive Breakin' League battles, Stevens, 49, got an inside look at the rise of breaking to an Olympic sport, something he said will be \"authentic, with a professional feel to it\" -- and could grow interest in workshops and classes.\n\n\"We allow it to be judged as a sport. ... But in reality, after it's over, the essential love of the dance is the art,\" said Stevens, aka B-boy Shogun. \"If stuff stays stagnant, it doesn't really grow. So it's always changing.\"\n\nBut change comes with challenges.\n\nCaldwell, who works in education and is part of a crew called The Elusives, said he prefers a freer, \"natural\" style. He doesn't break as intensely as he used to, but still practices with crewmates and occasionally competes and judges.\n\nHe said the Olympic version of breaking is more focused on \"athleticism rather than musicality.\" Music licensing issues can get in the way of high-profile battles (at the Olympics, DJs will choose from pre-cleared tracks), and videographers don't always catch key moments, Caldwell said.\n\n\"There's just more rules in place, unfortunately, when it comes to Olympic-style breaking,\" he said. \"It's ... never going to show the complete picture. Because the complete picture is either at a jam, or a party, or a social event where people are just getting down naturally to the real music playing around them. There's just going to be aspects that are kind of the core of breaking that won't be there.\"\n\n\"It's a hard shoulder shrug for me,\" he added. \"It wasn't meant to be fancy.\"\n\nThere's been talk in the breaking community about how the Olympics could prompt newer generations to focus more on big moves and the \"athletic elements\" over the subtler, artistic ones -- but that awareness means that outcome could be prevented, Deadly Venoms Crew's B-girl Gala said.\n\n\"Some of the best dancing is done when you're not thinking and it's coming from within,\" said B-girl Gala, 26, a nonbinary Baltimore breaker who uses they/them pronouns.\n\nWith crewmate Angela Miracle Gladue, aka B-girl Lunacee, B-girl Gala runs an organization called Break With No Fears, which connects women, gender-nonconforming, nonbinary and LGBTQ+ breakers.\n\nThey're optimistic that the Olympic platform will open up opportunities for breakers to make a better living, and have an impact on people who might not have seen themselves in breaking before.\n\n\"I'm hoping that the Olympics will inspire more girls to learn breaking,\" B-girl Gala said. \"Because seeing B-girls compete on an international stage would show that breaking is not just for boys.\"", "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Baltimore Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But few arise from the battle-centric beginnings of breaking -- never \"break dancing,\" a term disdained by pioneers and practitioners -- where spontaneous crowd response and the reaction of peers were the ultimate rewards.\n\nSixteen B-girls will compete on Aug. 9, followed by 16 B-boys on Aug. 10, all of whom will be measured by a panel of nine judges from around the world. Here's how they'll determine which breakers will win medals.\n\nBreakers will face off in head-to-head battles, similar to the competitions at parks and parties when breaking originated in the Bronx during the 1970s.\n\nThe competitors will be separated into four groups in an opening round-robin round and will not know the music ahead of time. A D.J. will spin, and the breaker will try to marry their moves to the music.\n\nEach battle will consist of three rounds, or throwdowns, with the breakers alternating one-minute turns. The breaker who wins the best of three will advance.\n\nEight winners -- two from each group -- will advance to the knockout or quarterfinal phase, where they will be ranked in a bracket according to their opening-round scores. The No. 1 ranked breaker will battle No. 8, No. 2 vs. No. 7, and so on, eliminating competitors through a final four and gold medal battle.\n\nThe judges will score breakers on five criteria: vocabulary, technique, execution, originality and musicality.\n\nDuring most cyphers, the circles where breakers battle informally, the applause of invested audiences declares a winner in real time. Likewise in the Olympic competition, viewers won't have to wait until after a battle ends to know who is ahead. Judges will use digital sliders, like the faders on a D.J.'s mixing board, to represent each of the scoring criteria, moving a slider toward the breaker they believe is ahead in, say, originality at that moment. There are penalties for crashes, wipeouts and falls.\n\nBreaking will also be the only Olympic sport with a misbehavior button. At its core, breaking is a battle of one-upmanship. But a judge can hit three different misbehavior buttons if a competitive act crosses the line into crassness.\n\nThe buttons range in the severity of the transgression, with the third reserved for the most overt ones like inappropriate moves or comments. In that case, the athlete's total score will be reduced by 10 percent.\n\nBreaking in Paris is overseen by the World DanceSport Federation, which ushered it into the Olympics.\n\nThe umbrella organization governs a wide range of dances, including Caribbean and disco. Nearly 30 years ago, it tried to introduce ballroom dancing to the Olympics.\n\nThe federation has no ties with breaking's roots, raising eyebrows for those wary that the art form would be appropriated. In 2017, more than 2,000 people signed an online petition titled \"Get the WDSF's Hands Off Hip-Hop,\" which accused the federation of trying \"to exploit breaking as a Trojan horse to get its foot in the door of the Olympics.\"\n\nBut the organization worked with breakers in mapping the journey to Paris. The DanceSport Breaking Committee, the organized branch of U.S.A. Breakers, includes Zack Slusser, a founding member of the Pro Breaking Tour who goes by B-boy Cracker Zacks, and Zahra Hamani, known as B-girl Jeskilz, a member of Rock Steady Crew.\n\n\"They want to pick different opinions, different styles to be as fair as possible, because all these dancers come from different places,\" said Beta Langebeck, a B-girl who has judged breaking competitions for Red Bull. \"The good thing is they have that option. They have options to get judges from all different styles to make it as fair as possible.\"\n\nOn the men's side, medal favorites include: Victor Montalvo, known as B-boy Victor, the first American to qualify for the Games and a two-time Red Bull BC One world champion; Menno van Gorp (B-boy Menno) and Lee-Lou Demierre of the Netherlands; and Japan's Shigeyuki Nakarai (B-boy Shigekix).\n\nLeading contenders among the women include: Dominika Banevic, a Lithuanian B-girl who just turned 17; Ami Yuasa and Ayumi Fukushima of Japan; Sya Dembele (B-girl Syssy) of France; and Logan Edra (B-girl Logistx) of the United States.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing", "type": "wiki",

They'll follow rules based on the Trivium judging system, which asks judges to evaluate breakers on their technique, vocabulary or variety, execution, musicality and originality.\n\nLike gymnastics, breakers have certain moves and tricks they work to land with precision and focus, but they'll also need to emphasize their style, personality and individuality as they sync to the beat of the DJ's soundtrack.\n\nThe elements of style and individuality play out from what the dancers wear, to their \"signature moves,\" to their b-boy or b-girl names themselves. No other Olympic sport has the structure of identifying the competitors this way, but it's a part of preserving the culture and essence of hip-hop in the art form, said Zack Slusser, vice president of Breaking for Gold USA and USA Dance.\n\n\"People coming into breaking need to understand that there's a history here of expression, especially from where it comes from,\" said Slusser. Hip-hop was born as a youth culture within Black and brown communities in the Bronx as a way to escape strife and socio-economic struggles and make a statement of empowerment at a time when they were labeled as lost, lawless kids by New York politicians.\n\n\"Hip-hop is about building that individuality and that style, that character. You just want to make sure your presence is known,\" said American Jeffrey Louis, or \"b-boy Jeffro,\" who compared b-boy style to a signature on a document.\n\n\"Your signature is your stamp of approval ... your presence is known. And if you look good and you feel good, of course, you're probably going to perform well, so it all ties into that performance.\"\n\nBeyond the athletics, it's about identity, self-expression, personality and charisma, and the breakers will be bearing it all on stage for the judges to evaluate and the audience to receive.\n\n\"I feel like I've been able to tap into different eras,\" said Logan Edra, or \"b-girl Logistx,\" from Team USA. \"My style is infinite. I tap into different styles and I have different portals that I'm able to channel through for my style and for my breaking.\"\n\nFor Dominika Banevi\u010d, or \"b-girl Nicka\", from Lithuania, it was important to familiarize herself with the origins of the dance and the moves the original breakers from the 1970s were hitting. The 17-year-old is one of the youngest breakers on the roster, but she values tradition above all.\n\n\"The beauty of breaking is to develop your own style ... but you have to learn the foundation really well. Learn the basics first, then you can come up with your own style,\" she said.\n\nThe b-girls will start Friday with a pre-qualifier between India Sardjoe of the Netherlands, or \"b-girl India,\" against the refugee team's Manizha Talash, or \"b-girl Talash,\" who is originally from Afghanistan and sought asylum in Spain. Talash was a late addition to the Olympic roster -- she missed registration for any qualifying breaking events, but her story of breaking and defying the strict rule of the Taliban in her home country captured the attention of the International Olympic Committee executive board, and she was invited to participate.\n\nThe b-boys take the stage Saturday.\n\nBreaking is not in the lineup of sports for the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, and Slusser said he's skeptical it'll make it into the events for Brisbane in 2032. It all comes down to funding.\n\n\"It was a miracle that we were even in Paris to begin with,\" he said. But for the breaking community, it's an achievement worth celebrating, even if it doesn't return to the Olympic stage.\n\nIn the end, breakers from the U.S. and around the world are hoping their debut at the Olympics leads to visibility and more resources for the breaking community through stakeholders and financial gains.\n\n\"The amount of exposure to the right people that can bring real change to our community, to our platform to help it grow -- it'll be significant to us. It'll allow us, for the first time, to find sustainability and help us elevate our platform,\" Slusser said.\n\n\"It would be great to see breaking make it back to the Olympic Games again. But at the same time, it's really going to go back to community work and leveraging this opportunity internally.\" ___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

First is toprock, which is footwork performed by the breaker in a standing position. There's also downrock, which is when breakers dance low to the ground and are equally supported by their arms and legs. Then, there are power moves, which are more complicated acrobatic moves where the breaker is typically only supported by one body part. Finally, there are freezes, where breakers stop all movement and maintain their balance in an often difficult position.\n\nBoos and cheers often decide the winners in the underground scene, according to B-girl Mantis. The Olympics' process is more formal, however.\n\nBreakers will take turns battling 1 on 1 over a series of three, one-minute rounds, to music that will be played by a DJ.\n\nAccording to the International Olympic Committee, nine judges will score athletes' performances based on these five factors: technique, vocabulary, musicality, execution and originality, with the last two categories counting the most. Each round will be judged individually and the competitor who wins the most rounds wins gold.\n\nYes and no. Local breakers expressed mixed feelings about the art form's global attention.\n\nJohn \"Flonetik\" Vinuya, who owns 360 Flow Breaking studio in Kensington, Brooklyn, with his wife B-girl Mantis, acknowledged that the sport's ascendance into mainstream national and international competitions can be great for the upcoming B-boys and B-girl dancers \"because they have a goal to reach.\"\n\nBut he expressed concern that the practice might lose a little of its freewheeling creativity.\n\n\"There's always going to be a fight between whether breaking is still culture or if it's a sport, now that you can make money off of it,\" Flonetik said. \"But there's still a lot of us out here that think about that cultural aspect of hip-hop, and we're not trying to commercialize it.\"\n\nGabriel \"Kwikstep\" Dionisio is one of the city's original breakers who started in 1981 at age 11. He echoed the idea that as the sport goes mainstream, it loses some of its earlier elements.\n\nHe said that mainstream commercial competitions like the Red Bull BC One competition and now, the Olympics, avoid the high stakes rivalries of more traditional breakdancing.\n\n\"Those are not battles, they're not cyphers in the way we know them,\" Kwikstep said. \"In a real cypher, the person you're battling may be your actual archnemesis, there might be real animosity.\"\n\nBut Kwikstep expressed dismay that breaking's popularity among Black and Latino youth in New York City was waning, even as it's gained a following in places like Japan, the Netherlands and France.\n\n\"Black and brown people, we export our culture around the world, and then wherever it was born, it becomes inaccessible to the people who created it,\" he said.\n\n\"After the interest about breaking from the Olympics is gone, how do we keep our own momentum going?\" he wondered.", "source": {"uri":

That same year, Chino 'Action' Lopez of the legendary crew the New York City Breakers wrote on a piece of paper: \"We, the New York City Breakers, see the Olympic Games as our future. We see breakdancing as a future Olympic sport, and ourselves as pioneers in making this dream a reality.

Here we are again, 40 years later, and breaking is about to make its debut at the Paris Olympic Games -- not as a form of entertainment but as a competitive sport.\n\nThere has been much discussion about its inclusion in the Olympics, and impassioned opinions are coming from all sides: from bewildered sports fans, from excited dance enthusiasts and from deep within the breaking community itself. \"It's this whole sport-verses-art thing,\" London \"B-Boy London\" Reyes told Observer. \"Everybody's trying to make breaking one or the other. To me, I think it can be two things at once.\"\n\nReyes, who grew up in the Bronx and now lives in Yonkers, entered the underground hip-hop scene in 1979 as a DJ (\"But not as the main DJ, just as a guy that would carry the crates.\") and started dancing in 1981. He was an early member of the New York City Breakers and has stayed connected to the crew and the wider B-boy community ever since. \"You can be disappointed in how it all played out,\" he said, referring to the long and complicated journey to get breaking accepted by the International Olympic Committee, \"But you can't be disappointed that it's in the Olympics. That's something to be celebrated!\" Then he added with a laugh that \"it's amazing something that started in the Bronx took the world over, really.\"\n\nA short history of breaking as an art form\n\nBreaking did start in the Bronx in New York City in the 1970s, as did the other pillars of hip-hop culture: DJing, MCing and graffiti art. The elements were inseparable, then: all part of a new lifestyle. Hip-hop's origin story is the stuff of legends -- a young Jamaican American DJ, a block party, a set of turntables and two identical records, people dancing to the instrumental breaks in the music.\n\nThe new style that evolved amid all that combined elements from many sources -- gymnastics, martial arts and capoeira, double dutch and social dances like funk, disco, the Lindy Hop and the Charleston. Breaking has always been both artistic and athletic.\n\nBreaking (and hip-hop culture in general) spread through the city and then, when the mainstream media took an interest, through the country and the world. Crews began to form and practice together, meeting up with other crews to show off their new routines and battle each other in gatherings that were casual but competitive.\n\nAt the time, breakers were mostly Black and Puerto Rican, mostly young and mostly male. B-girls were there from the beginning, too, but there were fewer, and they didn't get as much attention in the media. Ana \"Rokafella\" Garcia entered the scene in 1994 when breaking was, as she told Observer, \"not popular\" anymore. \"Many of the male Breakers from the original generation weren't so receptive to women trying to participate in Breaking... It was only a few who were enthusiastic about welcoming and helping to develop B-girl talent.\"\n\nOne of those few was Gabriel \"Kwikstep\" Dionisio, who Garcia called \"one of the last ambassadors of the original wave of Breakers\" in New York City. \"I realized that I had to have an undeniable high skill level if I was going to create a lane for myself. Kwikstep encouraged me to learn not only the moves but about the music, Breakin history and the roots of this dance, and that helped me establish myself as a force.\"\n\nGarcia is undeniably still a force, and her hard work has paved the way for this and future generations of B-girls. She and Dionisio went on to run Full Circle Productions together and are both still active in the breaking community.\n\nWhile breaking as an art form never went away, its mainstream popularity did wane. According to many, like veteran breaker and Princeton University lecturer Raphael Xavier, 1984 was the form's pinnacle. It was featured in movies, on TV, in commercials and at the Summer Olympics closing ceremonies. It was even slated for President Ronald Reagan's second inauguration ceremony. After that, things began to slow down, and it looked like breaking was on its way out.\n\nHow breaking became a competitive sport\n\nBut breaking was reborn, and its new form looked a lot like a sport. International breaking competitions have been taking place since the 1990s -- since 1990, to be exact, when Germany hosted the first Battle of the Year (BOTY), which was then called the International Breakdance Cup. Even though American mainstream culture had lost interest in breaking, the rest of the world hadn't. The BOTY was the first large-scale, formally judged breaking competition. It has been held annually ever since and is still one of the largest breaking competitions in the world.\n\nOther international breaking events soon followed, including the B-boy Masters Pro-Am (now the ProAm Dance/DJ Expo) in Miami in 1997, organized by Ricardo \"B-boy Speedy Legs\" Fernandez ,Jr., who is largely responsible for creating the blueprint for breaking competitions in the United States. Inspired by his background in competitive martial arts, he created separate categories based on abilities and styles, including Traditional 1vs1, B-Girl and Crew Battles. He also created one of the first judging systems for competitive breaking.\n\n\"He had a concept,\" Antonio Castillo told Observer. \"It wasn't just the circle, people battling. He created a system.\" Castillo entered the scene as a B-boy in 1996 and has become one of the most influential advocates for the sport. He founded The Lab Breakin' Academy in Washington D.C. and the Competitive Breakin League. He met Fernandez, Jr. around 2010 and the two became fast friends. \"You know, us three, the New York City breakers, Speedy Legs and myself, we all have something in common, right? And that's that we all saw breaking as a sport.\" Castillo helped expand the reach of that sport by developing scoring criteria, rules and regulations and an arena for competitions. He traveled around the U.S. to share his system with other communities so that they could host their own events.\n\nThese formally judged competitions breathed new life into the breaking community, and many other large-scale events rose up around the world, including the World DanceSport Federation's World Championships and the Red Bull BC One Championships.\n\nAfter years of negotiations headed up by the WDSF, as well as advocacy by Castillo and other competitive breaking advocates, the International Olympic Committee finally agreed to include breaking on the sports programs for the 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires (where it topped one million viewers, according to NBC) and then -- thrillingly -- to the 2024 Olympic Games now on in Paris.\n\nThe structure of the Olympic competition\n\nHere's how it will work: 16 B-Girls and 16 B-Boys will face off in solo battles, with the women competing on August 9 and the men on August 10. The full-day competitions are expected to last about five hours.\n\nEach day will begin with round robin sets of four groups of four. Every one-on-one battle in the round robin will consist of two rounds (each exchange between one breaker and another is a round). When one breaker finishes their round, their opponent instantly begins their routine in a battle format. After each breaker faces the other three opponents in their group once (with solos lasting approximately one minute), the breakers will be ranked by number of rounds won, with the top two in each group advancing to the quarterfinals. In the quarterfinals, semifinals and finals, each battle is a three-round one-on-one contest. The semifinal winners will face off for gold, while the semifinal losers will compete for bronze.\n\nBreaking's scoring system explained\n\nA panel of nine judges will score the battles on five criteria: technique, vocabulary, originality, execution and musicality. Each category constitutes 20 percent of the total score.\n\n\"Technique\" and \"execution\" focus on the actual skills the athletes are performing -- how well they do the moves and how smooth the transitions are between. \"Vocabulary\" deals with the moves themselves -- their variety and difficulty. \"Musicality\" is one of the most exciting categories to watch because the breakers don't know what music the DJ will play until it's playing. They will have to quickly connect to the beat and improvise.\n\nBreakers come prepared with moves, but their routines are never fully choreographed. They must decide on the spot, based on the music and their current opponent, what to do next. This takes us to the final category, \"originality,\" which gets to the deepest roots of breaking. The best breakers have always created their own moves and their own fresh styles. Repeating themselves or \"biting\" (copying) others can negatively impact scores.\n\nThat said, there are no raw scores assigned to individual moves, as in gymnastics or figure skating. The panel will be judging the competitors on a sliding scale in a comparative judging system. Whichever competitor is deemed the winner by the majority of judges will win the round.\n\nThe Trivium Judging System, which builds on the pioneering work of breakers like Fernandez, Jr. and Castillo, was developed by influential B-boy Niels \"Storm\" Robitzky and DJ Kevin \"Renegade\" Gopie. The \"intuitive digital scoring platform that allows judges to react to Breakers in real-time according to their physical (body), artistic (mind) and interpretative (soul) qualities\" was used in the 2018 Youth Olympics with great success.\n\nThe moves you'll see in Olympic breaking\n\nAs you watch for musicality and originality, there are certain movements you'll see. Each routine starts with moves performed standing up, known as top rock. Top rocking was traditionally used to clear the space in a packed room, signaling others to get out of the way. This is where breakers establish their fierce or cute or funny personas. Back in the day, this could take up most of the dance routine, but nowadays, it's only the beginning.\n\nThen the breakers will transition to the floor with a (smooth, hopefully) \"go-down\" or \"drop\" to begin down rock -- the moves performed on the floor. Subcategories in down rock include footwork (like leg sweeps, kicks and the six-step), supine spins (like the 1990 or 2000) and power moves (like the windmill, float and the flares and air flares inspired by pommel horse flares). Another move to look for is the freeze -- actually the opposite of movement -- when the breaker halts their set completely while holding a difficult position. Breakers can also throw in other tricks like flips and headpins.\n\nWho to watch in the Paris games\n\nMost of the athletes competing qualified via the 2023 World Championships, the Continental Games/Championships (Africa, Asia, Europe, Pan Am and Oceania) and the Olympic Qualifier Series (OQS) held in Shanghai and Budapest in May and June of this year. France was granted two spots (one per gender), and there were four Universality places (two per gender) on offer. To be eligible for a Universality place, athletes needed to compete in the OQS and finish in the top twenty-four of the final rankings.\n\nThe U.S. will be represented by four athletes: Sunny Choi (\"B-Girl Sunny\"), Logan Edra (\"B-Girl Logistx\"), Jeffrey Louis (\"Jeffro\") and Victor Montalvo (\"Victor\").\n\nChoi, a former gymnast, is the 2019 world silver medalist and 2023 U.S. champion. Edra finished second at the 2023 U.S. Championships behind Choi and won the Red Bull BC One World Final in 2021. Louis lost to Montalvo in the 2022 World Games final and is ranked No. 4 in the World DanceSport Federation rankings. Montalvo is the 2023 world champion and is considered the gold medal favorite.\n\nOther B-Girls expected to contend for the medal are Lithuania's 2023 world championship Dominika Banevic (\"B-Girl Nicka\"), Japan's 2022 world champion Ami Yuasa (\"Ami\"), Japan's 2021 world champion Ayumi Fukushima (\"B- Girl Ayumi\"), the Republic of China's 2022 world runner-up Liu Qingyi (\"671\"), France's bronze medalist at the 2023 Worlds Say Dembele (\"B-Girl Syssy\"), and the Netherlands' 2022 European and Red Bull BC One champion India Sardjoe (\"India\").\n\nOther B-Boys to watch for are Canada's former world champion and Pan American champion Philip Kim (\"B-Boy Phil Wizard\"), Japan's bronze medalist at the 2018 Youth Olympics, 2022 World Games and 2023 World Championships Shigeyuki Nakarai (\"B-Boy Shigekix\"), France's 2022 European champion Danis Civil (\"B-Boy Dany Dann\") and Kazakhstan's 2021 Red Bull BC One World Final champion Amir Zakirov (\"Amir\").\n\nWhat to look for when watching Olympic breaking\n\nWhen I asked veteran breakers what to look for when watching both the art and sport of breaking this during the Paris Games, they offered this advice:\n\nReys said, \"Look for a person's energy. Like when you hear people speak, they can speak in a calm manner, or they can speak in a more forceful tone. Usually, the person who speaks with a little bit more of a forceful tone will get more attention. It's the same thing with breaking. The one who speaks with more of a force when they dance is going to get a little bit more attention... Also, look for originality. Something that's different, unique, peculiar, odd or special. And then look at form. Lines, movement, the way they get in and out of things, the way they start and finish things. I think that's pretty important, too. What is it that they're trying to say? What statement are they leaving?\"\n\nGarcia said, \"It's a dance, so listen to the music and see how each one responds to it with their moves. It's also a call and response, so look at how they each respond to what the other dancer does and try to outmaneuver the other.\"\n\nCastillo said, \"Look at the exchange between competitors. There's a conversation going on when they're going back and forth. It's not just technical moves. There's a feeling behind it. Be aware that everyone has their own unique style. And the biggest thing is that people are dancing to the music on the spot. There is no premeditated music selection or anything like that.\"\n\nAnd Xavier said, \"I urge the viewers to sit back and enjoy what they are going to witness. Do not place judgment on any parts of the event. Definitely do not compare yesteryear to today's current state of breaking or the culture. Do not compare race or ethnicity. Extremely different times, places, generations, cultures and circumstances have gotten it to this point.\"\n\n\"One thing hip-hop has done is bring together a multiverse of cultures, backgrounds and traditions,\" he added. \"Let's enjoy this moment together as it was intended.\"\n\nThe inaugural Olympic Breaking competition will start on Friday, August 9 and conclude on Saturday, August 10.

The scores can fluctuate throughout the battle, based on how breakers respond to their opponents.\n\nIn all, 32 breakers - 16 women and 16 men - will compete over two days, Aug. 9 and 10, at the iconic Place de la Concorde, a public square in Paris that is being transformed into an open-air stadium for the Olympics.

But recently, she's zoned out to her boyfriend's favorite song, \"\u00c9touff\u00e9e\" by Vince Staples.\n\n\"It's a nice chill kind of vibe,\" she said at the Nike Athlete House in Paris. \"But it's actually good for warming up like right before a battle. It gets you into it.\"\n\nChoi said her other go-to song is Nas' \"Hate Me Now\" featuring Puff Daddy.\n\n\"It gets you in the mode to go destroy something,\" she said. \"I'll turn this on when I'm sprinting. ... It helps to motivate me. I can use the music to kind of change over time my mood. I can ramp up or ramp down using the music.\"\n\nAhead of breaking's Olympic debut this week, dancers from Philly-based Hip Hop Fundamentals brought the sport to the Comcast Center Plaza.\n\nBenyaamin Barnes-McGee, director of operations for Hip Hop Fundamentals and a 5x world champion who goes by the B-Boy name BoxWon, said he was excited to showcase breaking and introduce people to the sport, artform and culture.\n\nBarnes-McGee said he started breaking around the time Choi was attending school in Philadelphia. They've seen each other at competitions for years.\n\n\"She is very talented. Very talented,\" Barnes-McGee said. \"A tactician and has a high chance of bringing home the gold.

If you're not familiar with breaking terminology, not to worry.\n\nHere's a glossary of terms you might hear during the breaking competition.\n\nSEE MORE: How to watch breaking at the Paris Olympics: TV and stream info, schedule\n\nWhen you heard breaking was joining the Olympic sport roster, you might have wondered why it's not called breakdancing.\n\nThe simple answer is that breakdancing is not the real title of the sport. Breaking originated in the Bronx in the 1970s. DJ Kool Herc realized that people tend to dance with more energy during the instrumental section songs, also known as the \"break.\" He then created the style of producing a song composed entirely of the dancing beat, or the \"breakbeat.\" Herc began hosting parties, and then later competitions, where people would come and dance to his breakbeats without having heard them beforehand. They called the dancing to these beats, \"breaking,\" and the sport was born.\n\nWhen breaking started to permeate throughout more mainstream media, such as television and movies, people began referring to it as breakdancing, though that was never the term used by the true breaking community.\n\nSEE MORE: At just 17, Lithuanian breaker Dominika Banevic eyes Paris gold\n\nThe terms \"B-Boys\" and \"B-Girls\" are titles for the breaking athletes themselves. When DJ Herc began hosting breaking parties and competitions, he called the participants \"Break-Boys\" and \"Break-Girls.\" Ever since, breaking athletes have often used the title in front of their breaking name. For example, Canadian breaking athlete, Philip Kim, is known as \"B-Boy Phil Wizard.\"\n\nWhile many breaking athletes use the prefix, not all prefer it, with some competitors electing to just be referred to by their breaking name.\n\nPower head: Someone who loves to practice and perform mostly power moves in their breaking, which are acrobatic moves that require momentum, speed, endurance, strength, flexibility, and control. The breaker is generally supported by their upper body, while the rest of their body creates circular momentum.\n\nFootwork cat: Someone who loves to practice and perform footwork in their breaking.\n\nPopping: A continuous flexing of the muscles to the beat. Some moves include arm and body waves that look like an electric current has passed through the body.\n\nLocking: Freezing from a fast movement and \"locking\" into a certain position, holding it, and then continuing at the same speed as before.\n\nHeadspin: In a headstand position, the breaker spins by pushing with their hands.\n\nHeelspin: Breaker puts their weight on one heel and initiates a spin by swinging their leg.\n\nWindmill: Breaker rotates continuously on one shoulder with their feet in the air and legs apart.\n\nBackspin: Breaker balances weight on their upper back and goes into a spin by pushing with their hands or swinging the legs across the body.\n\nThrow down: When the B-Girl or B-Boy hits the floor and starts breaking, they are doing a throw down.\n\nSet: A set is a breaker's prepared round or combination of moves.\n\nRepeating: When a breaker reuses a move that they've already done during the competition, they are considered to have been \"repeating.\" Twenty percent of a breaker's score is originality, and repeating can negatively impact that score.\n\nBite/biter/biting: When a breaker is accused of \"biting\" or being a \"biter,\" it means that they have either stolen or copied moves/style from another breaker. Similar to \"repeating,\" this can also affect a breaker's originality score.\n\nCrashing: If a breaker \"crashes,\" it means they failed an attempted move and fell during or at the end of their attempt. This may be the most common cause of a breaker losing a battle. The best breakers, however, know how to turn a crash into a move and can control the crash enough to continue their flow into something else.\n\nCrew: A group of breakers who train and compete together.

Here's all you need to know about it and the physics behind breakdancers' moves.\n\nBreaking is set to debut at the Olympics around 7:30 pm on Friday. Wondering what this 'Breaking' is exactly? In simple words, it's breakdance. Breakdancing is professionally known as Breaking. At the games on Friday, dancers will be seen twisting, spinning, and seemingly defying gravity as they show their moves in a one-on-one battle to win a medal on August 10.\n\n\"It is a sport that combines dance and athletic movement requiring balance, strength and flexibility,\" a video shared by the Paris Olympics explained while describing this new sport.\n\nBreaking is a one-on-one battle in which athletes are judged on their dance moves. It's \"an urban dance style\" that began in New York as one of the pillars of hip-hop culture. It will mow make its Olympic debut at Paris Games 2024.\n\nIt will be held at the Place de la Concorde, the largest public square in the city.\n\nThis is the first time Breaking has been added as a sport in an Olympic Games. Breaking had first featured at the Summer Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires in 2018. \"Following its outstanding success at the Games in Argentina, breaking was added to the Paris 2024 Olympic programme as a new sport,\" Paris Olympics website says.\n\nThe sport was officially added to the Olympic program on December 7, 2021. As of now, breaking is not scheduled to be included on the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic program.\n\nAs per the details shared by the Paris Olympics official website, athletes will use a combination of power moves -- including windmills, the 6-step, and freezes -- \"as they adapt their style and improvise to the beat of the DJ's tracks in a bid to secure the judges' votes and take home the first Olympic breaking medals\".\n\nAthletes often perform a mix of leg sweeps, swings and kicks, as well as 360-degree spins. Numerous fast spins in succession is known as a power move, in which the athletes' feet rarely touch the ground. The opposite of a power move is said to be a \"freeze\" - where dancers stop completely during a routine.\n\nThe National Geographic explained a part of physics that helps break-dancers to freeze in between their set.\n\nIn a short video, Nat Geo explained, \"The key to maintaining that balance is having our centre of mass over a source of support. So, in order to hold the freeze position, breakers have to make sure that their centre of mass is located over an area of support on the ground.\"\n\n\"This is why so many of the freeze positions that are seen have a hand, elbow, or even a head down on the floor. It sets up a triangle that acts as a wide base of support, which allows the breakers to move their limbs and bodies around in different directions,\" the video explained with illustrations.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "akriti_anand@livemint.com", "name": "Akriti Anand", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Breakdancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gravity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_move", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power move"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_de_la_Concorde", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Place de la Concorde"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Street dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Athletics at the Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Youth Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buenos Aires"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buenos Aires"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Geographic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-step", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "6-step"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windmill", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windmill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Center of mass"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/08/09/600x338/67_1723206516081_1723206518522.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801468", "eventUri": "eng-9801468", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 587, "textEnd": 596}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Here's what to know about it", "body": "PARIS, France -- Breakdancing -- professionally known as breaking -- is set to take center stage in the final days of the Paris 2024 Olympics. It's the first time a medal will be up for grabs for the sport with dancing roots.\n\nHere's everything you need to know.\n\nBreakdancing -- professionally known as breaking -- began in the Bronx borough of New York City in 1970s, where it was rooted as part of the hip-hop scene. The word \"breaking\" refers to the instrumental breaks in the music.\n\nThe sport is renowned for its lively freestyle battles between two dancers that include acrobatic movements, fast footwork and the involvement of the DJ and an MC. It requires a lot of agility, balance, strength and flexibility.\n\nIn breaking, \"B-boys\" for men and \"B-girls\" for women go head-to-head in one-on-one battles led by an MC to music played at random by a DJ.\n\nInternational competitions were first held in the 1990s, but the event is making its Olympic debut for the first time ever at the Paris Games.\n\nThe 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires was the first time an Olympic event showcased breaking. After massive success, it joined the official program for Paris 2024 where it will be the only new sport contested at the Games.\n\nThe competition will take place in the La Concorde, the largest public square of Paris, where many of the newer and more urban sports, like skateboarding, BMX Freestyle and 3x3 Basketball, have been held.\n\nBreaking involves dancers linking together a series of fast-paced moves that break down into either \"top rocks\" or \"down rocks.\" Top rocks happen when the dancer is standing, and usually marks the start of a routine before they head down to the floor for the down rock portion of the routine. In the down rock, athletes are using their hands just as much as their feet in their movements.\n\nWhile in the down rock, dancers move quickly from leg sweeps to swings, kicks and 360-degree spins. Athletes can combine a series of moves and spins for a \"power move,\" where the dancers' feet hardly ever touch the ground.\n\nThe opposite of a power move is a \"freeze,\" where dancers halt their routine, frozen in a pose, showing off the strength and balance needed for breaking.\n\nAt the Olympics, 16 B-boys and 16 B-girls will battle, where athletes will be judged on five categories: musicality, vocabulary, originality, technique and execution. Each category accounts for 20% of the score.\n\nEach breaker has 60 seconds to complete a routine.\n\nAccording to the Olympics, B-Boy Victor, from the United States, and B-Girl Nicka are the reigning world champions, but they predict half the field would have a shot at the top prize on any given day. But with the grueling schedule in the heat, it will likely come down to the day.\n\nThe inaugural competition will happen Friday, Aug. 9 and Saturday, Aug. 10, with the women's competition taking place on the first day and the men's competition the second day.\n\nEach day will start with a \"round-robin\" phase with four groups of four. The top two in each group will advance to the quarterfinals, followed by the semifinals and, finally, the battle for medals. It will all happen over the course of about five hours.\n\nThe first battle between the women is slated for 10 a.m.", "source": {"uri": "wltx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WLTX News 19 Columbia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Breakdancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Disc jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boroughs of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_rap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle rap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrobatics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acrobatics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3x3_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "3x3 basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_BMX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle BMX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Concorde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Youth Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skateboarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buenos Aires"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buenos Aires"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Round-robin tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Circus", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Circus", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.wltx.com/assets/WXIA/images/d9e7111a-a5fc-4af8-8cf1-67082b35fc1d/20240808T233705/d9e7111a-a5fc-4af8-8cf1-67082b35fc1d_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801468", "eventUri": "eng-9801468", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 2804, "textEnd": 2810}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 2825, "textEnd": 2832}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

The competition will see 16 B-boys and 16 B-girls vying for gold in two electrifying events -- one for men and one for women.\n\nSet against the stunning backdrop of Place de la Concorde in Paris, the women's competition kicks off on August 9, followed by the men's event on August 10. The breakers will showcase a thrilling mix of power moves, including iconic techniques like windmills, the 6-step, and freezes, as they battle through round-robin stages, quarterfinals, semifinals, and intense medal battles.\n\nBreaking, a core element of hip-hop culture alongside DJing, rapping, and graffiti, originated in the Bronx, New York, in the 1970s. Over the decades, it has evolved into a recognized competitive sport. Its inclusion in the Olympic program came after its overwhelming success at the 2018 Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, where it drew over a million spectators.\n\nThe competition rules are as dynamic as the dance itself. Breakers, known as B-girls and B-boys, will engage in head-to-head throwdowns -- best-of-three-round dance-offs where each competitor has up to 60 seconds to showcase their skills. The opposing breaker will respond with their own moves, making for a high-energy battle.\n\nJudging these epic showdowns will be a panel of nine experts, who will score each round based on five key criteria: technique, vocabulary, execution, musicality, and originality. Each category contributes 20 percent to the overall score. Using a digital slider, judges will make real-time decisions, shifting in favor of the dancer who excels in each category.\n\nAs the world watches, these breakers are set to make history, bringing the raw energy and creativity of breaking to the Olympic stage for the first time.", "source": {"uri": "dnaindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Breakdancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recording Industry Association of America certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_de_la_Concorde", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Place de la Concorde"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_(culture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop (culture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2018_Summer_Youth_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-step", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "6-step"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_move", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power move"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graffiti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Round-robin tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disc jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epic poetry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buenos Aires"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buenos Aires"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern_Pentathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern Pentathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2024/08/09/2645226-dscxcdc-c-x-4-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801468", "eventUri": "eng-9801468", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "dateEnd": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 130, "textEnd": 145}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 567, "textEnd": 575}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 608, "textEnd": 617}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

It is an art form': Breaking and its origins take the Olympic stage", "body": "PARIS -- Jeffrey Louis' parents were not pleased when they discovered that their youngest son had not just taken up breakdancing but had become obsessed with it. As proud Haitian immigrants, they had a vision of the American dream, and this was not it.\n\n\"My parents didn't want me breaking at all,\" Louis said earlier this week. \"We came from Haiti, we came here for opportunity. So, when my parents found out that I was breaking, it just didn't seem like the best choice as far as creating a career path.\"\n\nHis parents came around in 2022 when Louis qualified for the World Games. His sister sent him a video of his mother dancing while he was competing. \"That's when I realized they had my back,\" he said. \"From there on I was really able to go on and fully focus on breaking.\"\n\nOn Friday, Louis' family will be in Paris watching him make history as a member of Team USA's inaugural Olympic breaking team. Louis is an Olympian and a pioneer. The University of Houston grad is a hometown hero.\n\n\"I've been received really well,\" he said. \"I have a strong community behind me in my city. It seems like the whole United States has started following through and getting behind this whole movement.\"\n\nLouis and his Olympic teammates, Logan Edra, Victor Montalvo and Sunny Choi, will uphold the honor of a discipline that was created in the Bronx neighborhood in New York, by young African American dancers in the early 1970s. The art form has become a global phenomenon. While that has been great as far as growth is concerned, there is pressure to represent.\n\nJust as the U.S. men's and women's Olympic basketball teams are expected to win gold, the U.S. breaking team feels pressure to win gold in an art form that was created in the United States.\n\n\"I live in New York, so I get, 'You don't have a choice, you got to bring it home. You have to represent,' \" Louis said. \"There are moments where I'm like, 'I don't know if I can do this.' But I have to remember, one, I'm here, I'm representing and two, at the end of the day, they're going to be happy for me no matter what. But I've had to kind of work through that, because initially that was something that I really struggled with. Going to jams and just hearing that over and over again. It's like, 'But what happens if I don't [win]?' But just being here, we've already made it we've already won.\"\n\nThe narrative of whether breaking is art or sport has emerged as a source of concern, if not controversy in elements of the breaking community. Purists don't want the dance to be a sport. They do not want to forget dance and its connection to music and rhythm. Some question whether breaking being in the Olympics will take away from the culture and the essence of breaking.\n\n\"I think that if you have the right representatives, it's not going to take away,\" Louis said. \"It's only going to put it in the best light possible.\"\n\nMontalvo was clear that while breaking has been accepted as an Olympic event, it remains an art form. \"First of all, this is a dance,\" he said. \"It is an art form, so it's not about who's the fastest, who's the strongest. It's about who has more showmanship, who has more originality, character and creativity.\"\n\n\"We're still athletic and were artists. We're both, so for us it's about being ourselves and keeping the essence alive,\" Edra said.\n\nThe competitive element of sport won't hurt the art because breaking has always been fiercely competitive. \"The battles have always been part of breaking,\" Edra said. \"As long as we tap into that spirit and that energy of the battle, that's part of it. That's why breaking's special. There's nothing else that has the battle part of it and the dance is part of it.\"\n\nInside and outside of the breaking community, reactions varied when the International Olympic Committee announced that breaking would become an Olympic sport.\n\nChoi, a Wharton School graduate, was skeptical. \"Initially I was like, 'This can't be real,' not because I don't think that breaking fits in, but it didn't match in my mind, what the Olympics represented to me. I saw it as this kind of platform for these very refined and elegant sports.\"\n\nChoi's dream was to be an Olympic-caliber gymnast. In her mind, breaking was the complete opposite of gymnastics.\n\n\"It's just like really cool, vibrant culture started in the streets,\" Choi said. \"It's a little bit gritty but still really raw. Imagine that in the Olympics. It just didn't work for me initially.\"\n\nThe momentum grew and breaking was added to the Paris Olympics. Choi had to make a choice, and she took up breaking. To pursue her childhood dream of going to the Olympics, she would go to the Olympics as a breaker, not a gymnast.\n\nMy first thought when I heard the news was \"appropriation,\" not because I studied breaking but because of how throughout history African American ingenuity and style has been stolen, marginalized and appropriated. I wondered how an urban underground grassroots art form, invented by African Americans and refined by Latin dancers -- now embraced by the world -- wound up in the Olympics.\n\nWould breaking's Black roots be acknowledged or erased?\n\nThese are the questions that prompted Serouj \"Midus\" Aprahamian to examine breaking history to make sure its Black roots are not erased. Aprahamian, an assistant professor of dance at the University of Illinois, was part of the breaking scene of the 1990s. He was born in Lebanon and came to the United States with his family at age 5. He grew up Rowland Heights, a small city, in the San Gabriel Valley of Los Angeles County.\n\nNow 43, Aprahamian has been involved in breaking and underground hip-hop dances since the 1990s, when he began breaking as a teenager. As a practitioner, especially after the commercialization of breaking in the 1980s, pioneers from the 1980s encouraged Aprahamian to dig into the history and find out where the dances he was doing came from. They cautioned him to not to treat them as a fad or a spectacle.\n\n\"So as a practitioner, looking into these questions of where the dance started, there was a bunch of contradictions, not just with breaking, but all of hip-hop is poorly disseminated,\" he said. \"Media narratives, even scholarly narratives, are pretty inaccurate.\n\n\"I basically had an opportunity to do a Ph.D. on this topic, and most of it is just driven as a practitioner wanting to know where this stuff comes from.\"\n\nHis dissertation became a book, The Birth of Breaking: Hip-Hop History from the Floor Up. His goal in writing the book was to set the record straight. Aprahamian wanted to go beyond the narrative that breaking was something that began in the Bronx and was a Black and Latino innovation. Breaking was Black at the beginning.\n\n\"One thing that was clear was when breaking started, it was a Black thing,\" he said during a recent interview. \"But nobody ever talked to those individuals. So, it's like their stories aren't accessible.\"\n\nThanks to social media, Aprahamian was able to track down some of the early breakers and go beyond well-known names. He interviewed some of the 1970s pioneers whose stories were never told, who were never known, who came before the era of the 1980s when breaking became documented and commercialized. These early breakers were undocumented geniuses and pioneers of what a global audience will witness in Paris on Friday and Saturday.\n\n\"We started hearing names of Kool Herc's parties being the epicenter of the hip-hop and breaking,\" Aprahamian said. \"But then you start hearing the names of people that were there.\"\n\nHe cited Keith and Kevin Smith, who called themselves the N -- a Twins (now the Legendary Twins). \"There was Phase 2, there's all these names you would hear, and you would know they're African American, but we never saw anything beyond just hearing their names. And then that alone was a question: Why don't we know them beyond just hearing their names?\" Aprahamian said.\n\nTo their credit, the members of this pioneering team of U.S. breakers are aware of the legacy they represent and the torch they carry for nameless generations of dancers who competed, not for medals but for pride and for a unique underground culture.\n\n\"For us it's important to keep the culture alive, and to remember the roots of it and to bring that essence here to show the world,\" Montalvo said.\n\nChoi added, \"One of the things I'm really looking forward to about breaking being in the Olympics is the additional exposure for our community. We understand that we wouldn't be here without the culture, without the community that started all of this.\"\n\nAprahamian is not sure that he will watch the two-day Olympic competition. He believes that other competitions throughout the year are equally as competitive but don't have the Olympic brand.\n\n\"If I want to see high-level breaking, I'm not really going to tune into the Olympics,\" he said. \"For all the talk about how this is going to change everything, I personally don't see what the big deal is. It's a one-time thing. Los Angeles didn't even accept breaking into its competition.\"\n\nThat breaking won't be at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics is a sore spot. But for Louis and his teammates, indeed, for every dancer/athlete competing Friday and Saturday, this Olympic breaking competition is a dream come true. And regardless of whether the United States wins the gold medal, Louis, Edra, Montalvo and Choi art part of a far-reaching homegrown legacy that has given a gift to the world.\n\nThe United States is responsible for this Olympic breaking party in France. The world has come here to celebrate and dance.", "source": {"uri": "andscape.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Andscape"}, "authors": [{"uri": "william_c_rhoden@andscape.com", "name": "William C.

The b-girls will be the first to battle each other, one-by-one, first through a round-robin phase. They'll follow rules based on the Trivium judging system, which asks judges to evaluate breakers on their technique, vocabulary or variety, execution, musicality and originality.\n\nLike gymnastics, breakers have certain moves and tricks they work to land with precision and focus, but they'll also need to emphasize their style, personality and individuality as they sync to the beat of the DJ's soundtrack.\n\nThe elements of style and individuality play out from what the dancers wear, to their \"signature moves,\" to their b-boy or b-girl names themselves. No other Olympic sport has the structure of identifying the competitors this way, but it's a part of preserving the culture and essence of hip-hop in the art form, said Zack Slusser, vice president of Breaking for Gold USA and USA Dance.\n\n\"People coming into breaking need to understand that there's a history here of expression, especially from where it comes from,\" said Slusser. Hip-hop was born as a youth culture within Black and brown communities in the Bronx as a way to escape strife and socio-economic struggles and make a statement of empowerment at a time when they were labeled as lost, lawless kids by New York politicians.\n\n\"Hip-hop is about building that individuality and that style, that character. You just want to make sure your presence is known,\" said American Jeffrey Louis, or \"b-boy Jeffro,\" who compared b-boy style to a signature on a document.\n\n\"Your signature is your stamp of approval ... your presence is known. And if you look good and you feel good, of course, you're probably going to perform well, so it all ties into that performance.\"\n\nBeyond the athletics, it's about identity, self-expression, personality and charisma, and the breakers will be bearing it all on stage for the judges to evaluate and the audience to receive.\n\n\"I feel like I've been able to tap into different eras,\" said Logan Edra, or \"b-girl Logistx,\" from Team USA. \"My style is infinite. I tap into different styles and I have different portals that I'm able to channel through for my style and for my breaking.\"\n\nFor Dominika Banevi\u010d, or \"b-girl Nicka\", from Lithuania, it was important to familiarize herself with the origins of the dance and the moves the original breakers from the 1970s were hitting. The 17-year-old is one of the youngest breakers on the roster, but she values tradition above all.\n\n\"The beauty of breaking is to develop your own style ... but you have to learn the foundation really well. Learn the basics first, then you can come up with your own style,\" she said.\n\nThe b-girls will start Friday with a pre-qualifier between India Sardjoe of the Netherlands, or \"b-girl India,\" against the refugee team's Manizha Talash, or \"b-girl Talash,\" who is originally from Afghanistan and sought asylum in Spain. Talash was a late addition to the Olympic roster -- she missed registration for any qualifying breaking events, but her story of breaking and defying the strict rule of the Taliban in her home country captured the attention of the International Olympic Committee executive board, and she was invited to participate.\n\nThe b-boys take the stage Saturday.\n\nBreaking is not in the lineup of sports for the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, and Slusser said he's skeptical it'll make it into the events for Brisbane in 2032. It all comes down to funding.\n\n\"It was a miracle that we were even in Paris to begin with,\" he said. But for the breaking community, it's an achievement worth celebrating, even if it doesn't return to the Olympic stage.\n\nIn the end, breakers from the U.S. and around the world are hoping their debut at the Olympics leads to visibility and more resources for the breaking community through stakeholders and financial gains.\n\n\"The amount of exposure to the right people that can bring real change to our community, to our platform to help it grow -- it'll be significant to us. It'll allow us, for the first time, to find sustainability and help us elevate our platform,\" Slusser said.\n\n\"It would be great to see breaking make it back to the Olympic Games again. But at the same time, it's really going to go back to community work and leveraging this opportunity internally.\" ___", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AP NEWS"},

Breakdancers, termed B-boys and B-girls, from around the world will face off in solo battles for the first-ever Olympic medals awarded in breaking.\n\nRoxbury dancer and Team USA athlete Alex Diaz, otherwise known as B-boy El Ni\u00f1o, is president of a Boston breaking crew called the Floor Lords. The group performed at the Omni Boston Hotel at the Seaport on Sunday to celebrate the initiation of breaking as an Olympic sport and demonstrate what the competition will look like. Diaz was joined by dancers Vayu Kieta, Alfred Hibbert, and Nic Fortenbach to perform in front of the gathering crowd, spinning, flowing, and propelling from limb to limb to hype up onlookers.\n\nThe crew was formed in 1981, making it one of the oldest breaking groups not just in the country, but the whole world. Before him, his uncle, Lino Delgado, or B-boy Leanski, was president and one of the earliest members of the crew.\n\nFollowing the performance, Diaz had some advice on what newcomers to the sport should look out for.\n\nBreaking is a one-on-one competition, and each dancer will get two solo rounds to showcase their expertise. Because DJs mix the music live, dancers don't know the songs beforehand and must perform an improvised routine. However, they come prepared with sets and combinations that they've practiced beforehand, said Diaz.\n\nAthletes will be scored based on five criteria: technique, vocabulary, originality, execution, and musicality. This means that the judges are looking at how a dancer's form is, how they are using the different elements of breaking, whether they are listening to the music and following the beat, and what originality they are bringing to the table. Armed with iPads, judges will issue their scores by moving sliders for each of the five criteria, then calculating a final number.\n\nThere are four main elements of breaking. Toprock is movement that is done standing up, typically as an opener to the routine. Power moves are the main acrobatic moves of breaking, which require high speed and momentum. Footwork is how the dancer performs on the floor, with both their hands and legs supporting their body weight. And lastly, freezes are an abrupt halt of all movement to accentuate a beat.\n\nBreakers must be original in order to stand out from the rest. For example, Brazilian breakers may incorporate a bit of capoeira, a Brazilian martial art, said Diaz. Being of Puerto Rican and Dominican descent, he likes to mix a bit of salsa dance into his routines.\n\nThe DJ gives both dancers the same song to fairly evaluate which one performs better, then switches to a different song for the next round. All music is the same BPM, or beats per minute.\n\nTraining consists of practicing either improvisation or sets and combinations. For example, a common combo is a windmill to baby freeze, said Diaz, who teaches the windmill to his beginner students aged four to 11. In addition, breakers must repeatedly practice improvisation to show judges that they can go off-script without messing up, thus earning more points. Nutrition, strength training, and recovery are also just as important as practicing breaking, said Diaz.\n\n\"The dance keeps evolving as much as the human body lets it,\" said Diaz.\n\nEarly breakers in the 80s would head spin, then drop onto their backs, but that has largely changed into something more complex and difficult since then, first into continuous head spinning, then into posing or grabbing one's legs or chin while spinning. One move called the flare was adapted from gymnastics, resembling the movement an athlete does on the pommel horse apparatus.\n\nThe U.S. roster consists of Victor Montalvo, or B-boy Victor, Jeffrey Louis, B-boy Jeffro, Logan Edra, B-girl Logistx, and Sunny Choi, B-girl Sunny.\n\n\"Breaking was invented here, and I think a lot of the breakers from the U.S., we just have what we call the essence,\" said Diaz, who expressed confidence in Team USA's chances. \"I'm hoping we get the gold, but overall, I think that we will at least be on the podium for sure.\"\n\nThe competition will be fierce, though, according to Diaz, and France will have the home field advantage. The best veterans and up-and-coming breakers from around the world are sure to put up a strong fight, including big names like Phil Wizard from Canada, Hiro10 from Japan, B-boy Menno and B-boy Lee from the Netherlands, and Hong 10 from South Korea.\n\nA member of Team USA, Diaz is heading to Paris later this week to support his teammates and witness history in the making. He will not be competing, as only the top two B-boys were chosen for the Olympics -- Diaz placed fourth.\n\nThe journey was an arduous one -- \"Oh wow, it was a lot,\" Diaz chuckled.\n\nThe community-based group Breaking for Gold USA partnered with USA Dance, a ballroom organization that already had ties to the International Olympic Committee and the World DanceSport Federation. They also had to come up with a point system and set up six national qualifiers around the country to find Team USA. This entire process then had to happen worldwide too.\n\nBut the hard work was worth it, said Diaz, all for the \"greater good of this Olympic dream.\"\n\nViewers can tune into the Paris Games' breaking competition on Friday, Aug. 9th and Saturday, Aug. 10th.", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sanjana_mishra@boston.com", "name":

Unfortunately for the darling of the Paris Games, he won't get to see the sport in 2028 when the Summer Games land in Los Angeles, his home city.\n\nThe inclusion of sports such as breaking are part of a flexible process to align with the goals of each host city's organizing committee, which \"proposes events that it feels are fit their vision for their specific edition of the Games,\" an IOC spokesman said in an email.\n\nInstead, Los Angeles selected cricket, flag football, lacrosse, squash and baseball/softball. In addition to breaking, karate, motorsport and kickboxing were rejected.\n\nCompetition for 16 \"B-girls\" is scheduled for Friday, while the men will battle Saturday.\n\nDespite the disappointment from fans about the 2028 Games, the breaking community appears unfazed.\n\n\"I'm just focused on the Paris 2024 Olympics,\" said Team USA''s Victor Montalvo, or B-boy Victor. \"For us, it was shocking that we were even in the Olympics because we never expected it at all. So, we're just appreciative.\"\n\nFor Montalvo, the highest ranked U.S. male breaker in the world and the first person to qualify for Team USA breaking in the Olympics, the announcement that the sport would debut in Paris couldn't have come at a better time. Although winning any type of medal would be a success in Montalvo's eyes, his ultimate goal remains bringing breaking to a larger audience and inspiring new generations.\n\n\"So, I just want to make sure that everyone understands what this dance is about and what hip hop is about,\" he said. \"Because it's all about peace, unity and having fun.\"\n\nSet at Place de la Concorde, this year's breaking competition should be memorable. With street dancing's popularity in France, and the sport's debut at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympic Games in Argentina attracting over one million viewers, it's no surprise that breaking has been added to this year's Games.\n\nEdson Magana - also known as B-boy House - an accomplished breakdancer and assistant clinical professor at Arizona State's School of Music, Dance and Theatre, insists the Ollympics' knowledge of breaking, isn't entirely new. Instead, he sees this year's Olympic debut as a strategy to revive engagement with viewers and attract new generations, making breaking's inclusion both exciting and controversial.\n\nAlthough breaking's Olympic debut offers a great opportunity for the athletes, its exclusion from the Los Angeles Games is concerning, Magana said, considering breaking originated in the United States.\n\n\"I think the Olympics needs us more than we need them,\" Magana said.\n\nFrom Red Bull sponsorships to Samsung marketing campaigns, breaking has found global success, with championships held around the world.Yet Magana worries the Olympics might impact the very essence of breaking.\n\nWith a culture that was built on offering a voice to the voiceless, being accessible to everyone and prioritizing inclusion, some in the breaking community worry the Olympics might impact its message, though others remain hopeful about its positive impact.\n\nJeffrey Louis, or B-boy Jeffro, a member of Team USA's breaking team, understands the community's concern but remains optimistic.\n\n\"\"I know there's a lot of skepticism about will breaking take away from the culture, being in the Olympics, will it take away from the core, the essence of breaking,\" he said. \"But if we have the right representatives, it's not going to take away, it's only going to push it in the best light possible.\"\n\nTyquan Hodac, the executive director of Breaking for Gold USA, believes Team USA has the right representatives.\n\n\"These four (competitors), I call them the chosen ones,\" he said. \"They're really the ones to represent us on this platform. As you all know, the story of hip hop is basically a story of hope and these four are really representing that type of hope for the youth, for the culture, they're the voice of the voiceless.\"\n\nWhile Team USA breaking is optimistic about the culture being preserved, viewers familiar with breaking competitions should anticipate a few changes at the Olympics.\n\nUnlike typical indoor events, the breaking competitions will take place outdoors. The judging panel will consist of nine judges all adhering to a scoring system based on originality, technicality, vocabulary, execution and musicality.", "source": {"uri": "cronkitenews.azpbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cronkite News - Arizona PBS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Breakdancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Montalvo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Victor Montalvo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickboxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kickboxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrosse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lacrosse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Squash (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Softball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_de_la_Concorde", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Place de la Concorde"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Youth Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voicelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voicelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/secondbreak1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801468", "eventUri": "eng-9801468", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

The top two from each group will go to the quarterfinals and then semifinals, and the best-of-three medal round will determine who takes home the gold.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Breakdancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunny_Choi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunny Choi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Youth Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disc jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Louis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Louis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_de_la_Concorde", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Place de la Concorde"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Circus", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Circus", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/22/001e594f-3b1c-4709-a543-9171c1bb799a/thumbnail/1200x630/90316614abc90ca320757cf097033f83/ap24203604656953.jpg?v=0a0c17d349635d55704afd4e16e28fc6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801468", "eventUri": "eng-9801468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

The IOC has introduced an interesting event that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nTo gather the attention of the new generation, the IOC has decided to introduce something new, typically for urban sports. A new sport or exciting event has been added to the Olympic program, and that is called 'breaking.' But what is it? Currently, it is generating significant interest and attention. How does breaking work, and have any rules been tweaked for the Olympics? Let's take a look to understand this sport, which will make its debut at the Paris Olympics 2024.\n\nOne of the four fundamental elements of hip-hop, alongside DJing, rapping, and graffiti, breaking emerged in the streets of New York in the 1970s. It gradually transitioned from the streets to the Olympic stage. In 2020, the International Olympic Committee added breaking to the 2024 Summer Olympic lineup, and it is now set to take place in two categories, men's and women's. The women's competition will be held on August 9, and the men's competition will take place on August 10.\n\nOne of the four fundamental elements of hip-hop, alongside DJing, rapping, and graffiti, breaking emerged in the streets of New York in the 1970s.

Each match consists of the best of three rounds, known as throwdowns. In each throwdown, each breaker has 60 seconds to complete their routine, with the goal of outperforming their opponent.\n\nEach set consists of 16 breakers, divided into four groups of four participants each, competing in a round-robin stage. Just like in any other tournament, each participant will face all the other breakers in their respective group in one-on-one battles. The two victorious breakers from each group will advance to the quarterfinal stage, and eight breakers will be seeded from 1 to 8. The lower seed will face the higher seed in one-on-one battles. A knockout format will begin and continue through the semifinals and final stages.", "source": {"uri": "insidesport.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Sport India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aman_verma@insidesport.in", "name": "Aman Verma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graffiti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disc jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breakdancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Round-robin tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern_Pentathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern Pentathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://d16f573ilcot6q.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/breaking-event-olympics.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801468", "eventUri": "eng-9801468", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 1049, "textEnd": 1057, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 1104, "textEnd": 1113, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

There is also a strong focus on youth.\"\n\nBreaking follows in the footsteps of surfing, skateboarding and sport climbing, which were all contested for the first time at the Tokyo Olympics. Five more new sports will also be included at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, including cricket, squash and lacrosse.\n\nBreaking will take place at La Concordia on August 9-10, with 33 b-boys and b-girls competing in two separate medal events. 16 men and women will face off in head-to-head battles and perform to music chosen by DJs in order to prevent them from rehearsing routines to specific tracks.\n\nTheir routines will then be judged, with a specific focus on musicality, vocabulary, originality, technique and execution. Unlike the other judged sports at the Olympics, breakers will not be given a score with judges instead using a digital slider to pick the winner.\n\nEach of the five categories amount to 20% of the final score, with the winners of each battle progressing in a round-robin tournament. The b-girls event is taking place on August 9 and the b-boys event on August 10.\n\nNo breakers will be representing Team GB, with b-boy Kid Karam, b-boy Sunni and b-boy Sheku and failing to qualify for the Olympics. France, Japan and America have the most representatives with four, while the Netherlands, China and Ukraine will have three breakers in action.\n\nHowever, breaking is not scheduled to be part of the 2028 Games, with the president of the World DanceSport Federation Shawn Tay hopeful the sport's performance in Paris will help persuade the IOC to add bring it back for the 2032 Olympics in Brisbane.\n\n\"All of us at the WDSF are profoundly disappointed with this outcome,\" Tay said. \"We worked relentlessly over many months to present a powerful and passionate proposal that detailed all the many advantages breaking as a dance sport discipline brings to the Olympic Movement and Olympic Games.\n\n\"Ensuring the success of breaking's Olympic debut at Paris 2024 is therefore on the forefront of the WDSF agenda. Our performance in Paris will define the future of dance sport within the Olympic Movement, and it is imperative that we must work together to do everything within our power to exceed expectations next summer on the Place de la Concorde.\n\n\"By doing so, we will demonstrate on the dance floor that breaking, a sport popular among youths from diverse backgrounds, and a sport rooted in beautiful values such as inclusivity, is a perfect fit for the Olympic Games.\"\n\nFollow all the action from Day 14 of the Paris Olympics with Mirror Sport's live blog\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

This is FTW Explains: The Olympics. During the Olympics, some of the sports can be intimidating, especially if you're not super familiar with them. That's OK because we're here to help.\n\nBreakdancing, or simply breaking, is set to make its Olympic debut at the 2024 Paris Games. It was added to the Olympic lineup following success at the Summer Youth Olympic Games in 2018 in Buenos Aires.\n\nEach team at the Paris Olympics could qualify up to four athletes -- two each for the men's and women's competitions -- and Team USA has a full team of four breakers: Sunny Choi and Logan Edra for the women's competition and Victor Montalvo and Jeffrey Louis for the men's event.\n\nHow does breaking work as an Olympic event? As Olympics.com explains: \"Athletes will use a combination of power moves -- including windmills, the 6-step, and freezes -- as they adapt their style and improvise to the beat of the DJ's tracks in a bid to secure the judges' votes and take home the first Olympic breaking medals.\"\n\nAhead of the Games, For The Win spoke with Choi and asked her to explain her top-3 things Olympics fans should know when watching breaking.\n\n\"One of the biggest misconceptions that I have gotten along the way is that we choose our music; we do not,\" Choi told For The Win. \"The DJ picks the track for us, and we don't know what it's going to be, and sometimes it's a brand-new track.\n\n\"When we walk out there, it's definitely possible that the DJ is going to have new music produced for the Games that we've never heard before. And it's not like we get it in advance. They just play it and you go, so I think that adds an element of suspense and excitement.\"\n\n\"A lot of us are freestyling a lot of our rounds,\" Choi said. \"Not everyone freestyles 100 percent, and there's a wide variety. But you're going to see, especially with the American breakers, freestyling a lot. So even we don't know what we're going to do.\n\n\"So not only doing not knowing music, but we also don't really know exactly what we're about to go throw because it's dependent on the music. We really want to connect to the moment and to the music and then just go do what feels right. So I might kind of plan anywhere from like 20 to 40 percent of my round, but no more than that. Everything else is just what comes out in the moment.\"\n\nFor athletes and fans watching, Choi said to just enjoy it and be present in the moment because breaking is a good time.\n\n\"Breaking has this energy that I feel like you don't get in so many other sports,\" she said. \"It's like a party.

Each dancer has up to 60 seconds per round to showcase their moves, with the opposing dancer responding in kind.\n\nA panel of nine judges will evaluate each performance based on five criteria: technique, vocabulary, execution, musicality, and originality. Each criterion accounts for 20% of the total score. Judges will use a digital slider to score the performances in real-time, adjusting their scores to reflect the dancer's ability to surpass the other's record in each category.\n\nBreaking's inclusion in the Paris 2024 Olympics represents a thrilling expansion of the Games' traditional boundaries, celebrating not just athleticism but also cultural expression and artistic creativity.", "source": {"uri": "indtoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "INDToday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Breakdancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_(culture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop (culture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2018_Summer_Youth_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graffiti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_performance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Street performance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disc jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buenos Aires"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buenos Aires"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://indtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Nagarjuna-Sagar-Project-1024x576.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801468", "eventUri": "eng-9801468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Originating in the 1970s in New York, Breaking features techniques such as top rock and freeze moves. It was included to capture younger audience's interest, following its success at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympic Games in Argentina.Breaking makes Olympic debut in Paris on July 9, with the B-Girls Pre-Qualifier Battle at the Parc Urbain. The players known as breakers, or breakdancers, will sync their moves to the DJ's breakbeat in front of the biggest audience breaking has ever known. Interstingly, a Netherlands player named India will perform against Talash from Afghanistan today. However, Talash is representing Refugee Olympic Team in this game. The b-girls' competition will kick off on Friday with a pre-qualifier match between \"b-girl India\" (India Sardjoe of the Netherlands) and \"b-girl Talash\" (Manizha Talash of the refugee team). Talash, originally from Afghanistan, sought asylum in Spain.\n\nBreaking, originally known as breakdancing, is a dance form that has deep cultural roots. The term \"Breaking\" was chosen by the original B-Boys and B-Girls to reflect the dance's origins, which took place during DJ track breaks. The Olympics has adopted this term to honor its culture, history, and authenticity. Breaking started at block parties in New York in the 1970s and reached mainstream popularity by the 1980s, with groups like the Rock Steady Crew and the New York City Breakers pioneering many moves seen today.\n\nThe 33 breakers representing 15 countries and the Refugee Olympic Team will take to the dance floor on Friday and Saturday, vying for gold for the first time in Olympic history.\n\nThe techniques in Breaking include standing footwork known as top rock and floor movements known as down rock. The sport also incorporates tricks called power moves, which involve twists and spins, and freeze movements, where dancers freeze in poses using their heads or hands for support. A well-known example is the 'baby freeze.'\n\nToprock: This is how a breaker begins their dance while still standing, serving as an introduction to the dancer and their style before they transition to the floor for footwork and other moves.\n\nFootwork (Downrock): These are the ground moves where the breaker uses their hands for support while moving their legs through a series of steps.\n\nPower Moves: Dynamic moves that emphasize acrobatics and strength, involving repetitive, circular motions such as head spins, air flares, and windmills.\n\nFreeze: A static position where the breaker hits and holds a move for a few seconds, often syncing it with a specific beat or sound in the music for maximum impact.\n\nThe longest-running Breaking competition globally is the Battle of the Year, which began in Germany in 1990 as the International Breakdance Cup. The World DanceSport Federation was officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1997, cementing Breaking's place on the world stage.\n\nThe IOC aims to include sports that are popular and appeal to all age groups. Recently, it has introduced skateboarding, sport climbing, and surfing to the Games. It was first introduced at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympic Games in Argentina, where it garnered over 1 million viewers. The sport appeals to a younger generation through its dynamic performance and captures the interest of an older audience who enjoy watching it. Breaking was officially added to the Olympic program on 7 December 2021.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Same with modern pentathlon, where Jessica Savner of the U.S. muses about finding \"better ways to market and show our sport.\"\n\nThe situation for breaking, which begins competition on Friday, is somewhat different because the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles have already decided not to include it.\n\nStill, Montalvo and his fellow breakers say they feel the need to perform for something beyond individual glory.\n\nOlympic sports have come and gone during the last century.\n\nWho remembers that tug-of-war, rope climb and live pigeon shooting were once part of the Games? Baseball and softball are returning in 2028 after a brief departure, but their long-term status remains uncertain.\n\nBeing included can mean millions upon millions in broadcast contracts and corporate sponsorships.\n\n\"It's the golden ticket,\" said Mark Dyreson, a sports historian at Penn State. \"Getting onto the Olympic program can make a difference between your sport struggling and hitting the jackpot financially.\"\n\nThe International Olympic Committee monitors television numbers and demographics, with an emphasis on attracting younger audiences. Thus the addition of skating, surfing and, before them, snowboarding.\n\n\"They want the hot sports,\" Dyreson said. \"They want what TV wants.\"\n\nNew sports can wrangle an audition by way of a policy that allows each host city to propose additions to the program. Newcomers receive a one-time pass, no guarantee of sticking around.\n\nOlympic leaders have a say in all this, which helps explain why cricket will debut in 2028. Hardly a staple of the Southern California sports scene, it gives the IOC an entree into the South Asian market.\n\nBreaking, which traces its roots to New York in the late 1960s, was added this summer because of its popularity in France.\n\nThe competition will begin with a round-robin format in which breakers go head-to-head in \"battles,\" working their way through basic footwork, power moves and airborne tricks.\n\nJudges will watch for technique, repertoire, execution, musicality and originality, but instead of scoring the routines -- as in diving or gymnastics -- they will simply choose a winner. The top competitors advance to a knockout stage.\n\nTony Estanguet, president of the Paris 2024 organizing committee, said: \"Our ambition from the outset has been to highlight what has made the Games so strong for thirty-two Olympiads -- the diversity of sports, the emotion of performances -- while seizing the opportunity offered by the IOC to enrich this offering and propose a new dimension.\"\n\nAsked about making the program, French B-boy Mounir Biba responded: \"It only remains for us to live up to the honor bestowed upon us.\"\n\nLast year, Olympic officials met to decide the fate of modern pentathlon, a sport that for more than a century has combined running, swimming, fencing, shooting and equestrian show jumping.\n\nHardly a premier event, it suffered a critical blow at the Tokyo Games when television cameras caught German coach Kim Raisner punching an unruly horse during the riding competition.\n\nThe sport's international federation earned a temporary reprieve after voting to phase out jumping over the next four years and replace it with a segment in which athletes will traverse an obstacle course.\n\n\"We are not forgetting our past, our heritage, but our goal is the future,\" federation president Klaus Schormann said.\n\nSport climbing has also changed, but under different circumstances. Hoping to capitalize on a successful debut in Tokyo, officials will keep the boulder and lead formats as a combined event, but hold speed climbing separately.\n\nWith two racers scrambling side-by-side up a 50-foot wall, the speed event is made for television. Brooke Raboutou of the U.S. envisions her sport continuing to gain traction.\n\n\"I think more climbing gyms are coming up,\" she said. \"The Olympics just bring a lot more viewers and a lot more people.\"\n\nThe B-boys and B-girls have mixed emotions about Paris.\n\nSunny Choi of the U.S. calls it \"bittersweet\" that her sport will not be part of the Los Angeles Olympics. Montalvo says he is \"bummed\" about the one-and-done status. But the next couple of days will offer the chance to show the world a few things.\n\nThat breaking involves strategy and degree of difficulty. That it can be highly competitive -- if one breaker goes big, watch for the other to adjust on the fly, improvising trickier moves.\n\n\"This is a huge opportunity to bring eyes, bring awareness, bring resources, corporate sponsors,\" said Jeffrey \"Jeffro\" Louis of the U.S. \"This is an opportunity to build [the sport] up.\"\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, the breakers can put on a show that will pave the way for their return.\n\n\"People are going to see how amazing breaking is,\" Montalvo said. \"Hopefully it's back in 2032.\"", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

This is FTW Explains: The Olympics. During the Olympics, some of the sports can be intimidating, especially if you're not super familiar with them. That's OK because we're here to help.\n\nBreakdancing, or simply breaking, is set to make its Olympic debut at the 2024 Paris Games. It was added to the Olympic lineup following success at the Summer Youth Olympic Games in 2018 in Buenos Aires.\n\nEach team at the Paris Olympics could qualify up to four athletes -- two each for the men's and women's competitions -- and Team USA has a full team of four breakers: Sunny Choi and Logan Edra for the women's competition and Victor Montalvo and Jeffrey Louis for the men's event.\n\nHow does breaking work as an Olympic event? As Olympics.com explains: \"Athletes will use a combination of power moves -- including windmills, the 6-step, and freezes -- as they adapt their style and improvise to the beat of the DJ's tracks in a bid to secure the judges' votes and take home the first Olympic breaking medals.\"\n\nAhead of the Games, For The Win spoke with Choi and asked her to explain her top-3 things Olympics fans should know when watching breaking.\n\n1. Breakers have no control over what music is played\n\n\"One of the biggest misconceptions that I have gotten along the way is that we choose our music; we do not,\" Choi told For The Win. \"The DJ picks the track for us, and we don't know what it's going to be, and sometimes it's a brand-new track.\n\n\"When we walk out there, it's definitely possible that the DJ is going to have new music produced for the Games that we've never heard before. And it's not like we get it in advance. They just play it and you go, so I think that adds an element of suspense and excitement.\"\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Facebook (@facebook)\n\n2. Breakers are improvising a ton when they're competing\n\n\"A lot of us are freestyling a lot of our rounds,\" Choi said. \"Not everyone freestyles 100 percent, and there's a wide variety. But you're going to see, especially with the American breakers, freestyling a lot. So even we don't know what we're going to do.\n\n\"So not only doing not knowing music, but we also don't really know exactly what we're about to go throw because it's dependent on the music. We really want to connect to the moment and to the music and then just go do what feels right. So I might kind of plan anywhere from like 20 to 40 percent of my round, but no more than that. Everything else is just what comes out in the moment.\"\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Sunny Choi (@_sunnychoi)\n\n3. Breaking competitions can seem like one big party\n\nFor athletes and fans watching, Choi said to just enjoy it and be present in the moment because breaking is a good time.\n\n\"Breaking has this energy that I feel like you don't get in so many other sports,\" she said. \"It's like a party. You have an emcee who's hyping up the crowd. You've got a DJ, and then we're dancing, you know? And so there's an energy about it that's so different from so much else that you're going to see at the Games. And so I'm just like, go out there, be in the moment. Go scream for your favorite people, and have fun because I think it's going to be a really great event.\"\n\nSimone Biles made a surprising admission to Snoop Dogg about attending Olympic events The 2024 Paris Olympics Closing Ceremony will reportedly feature Snoop Dogg, Billie Eilish and Red Hot Chili Peppers Kevin Durant celebrated Team USA's comeback win against Serbia in the most wholesome way", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michelle_r_martinelli@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Michelle R.

Stylized footwork, acrobatic poses, and head spins are some of the moves that characterize the style of dance.\n\n\"People in the Bronx were having a really bad time back in the day,\" Navarro said. \"They were trying to find an escape.\"\n\n\"At first I thought (head spins) was about, like, speed and strength,\" Argueta said. \"But it's really not. It's about balance.\"\n\nArgueta says it takes years to perfect and create new moves that combine martial arts and gymnastics.\n\n\"Things don't happen overnight,\" Argueta said.\n\nThe B-boys and B-girls of North Texas are now more excited than ever that their sport and their culture will take center stage at the Olympics.\n\n\"It gives us another opportunity to compete and grow and train harder,\" Argueta said.\n\nThe Olympic battles for breaking are set for Friday and Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "nbcdfw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alicia_barrera@nbcdfw.com", "name": "Alicia Barrera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Breakdancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navarro_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Navarro County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Navarro County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rony_Argueta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rony Argueta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concorde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas\u2013Fort_Worth_metroplex", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrobatics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acrobatics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Street dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Texas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of North Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acrobatics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acrobatics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://media.nbcdfw.com/2024/08/n5pr-p-oly-breaking-aba_KXAS5XQ0_2024-08-08-16-41-44.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801468", "eventUri": "eng-9801468", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "dateEnd": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 162, "textEnd": 171}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

Then She Found Olympic Breaking", "body": "Women's Health may earn commission from the links on this page, but we only feature products we believe in. Why Trust Us?\n\nThere are some sports at the Summer Olympics that have been around for ages, like sailing or track and field. But some of the newer ones have tons of buzz -- and breaking is one of them.\n\nIn case you're not familiar with it, breaking is the professional form of breakdancing. It makes its Olympic debut on August 9, and people are understandably pumped about it.\n\nBreaking athletes are scored by a panel of judges and they need to show off their athleticism and artistry in response to spontaneous beats laid down by a DJ. Nine judges will score athletes on five criteria, per Olympics.com: Execution, musicality, originality, technique, and vocabulary (i.e. the variety of movements they use).\n\nOne athlete to watch is Sunny Choi, who won gold at the 2023 Pan American Games. Sunny actually has a background in gymnastics -- and she uses it in breaking.\n\nIn a July/August Women's Health print story, the 35-year-old said that she suffered a few knee injuries in high school during the thick of gymnastics training, which required surgery. She ended up feeling \"really burnt out\" and left the sport by the time she got to college at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\"I get to college and I'm just lost because I had spent my whole entire childhood in the gym and didn't know anything else,\" she said. \"I didn't know how to be a human, basically.\"\n\nShe ended up taking a free breaking class in college and found that her gymnastics skills came in handy. \"I started breaking, initially kind of recreationally,\" she said.\n\nBy the end of college, she was training seven days a week. \"I started battling and it was almost like an addiction,\" she said. \"I always had a bit of a bittersweet relationship with breaking. I hated it because it was so hard for me in so many ways and it challenged me in ways that I'd never been challenged before. But I also loved it for almost the same reasons.\"\n\nBut Sunny said that training for breaking is \"very, very different\" from training for gymnastics. \"I feel like, in some ways, breaking is so much harder than gymnastics because there's an added mental piece that was never there for me for gymnastics, which is that on-the-spot, creative element when we don't know a song that the DJ's going to play,\" she said. \"Some people kind of choreograph their rounds in advance, but to be more true to the roots of breaking, you should freestyle.\"\n\nUltimately, she's excited for breaking to burst onto the world stage -- despite critics asking why the sport is in the Olympics in the first place.\n\n\"I feel really grateful for being able to carry this role, and I feel like it's an opportunity to share [breaking] with a lot of people,\" she said. \"But I can't change everyone's perspective. Everyone's going to see this and take away what they want from it. My hope is that people see the authenticity in breaking.\"", "source": {"uri": "womenshealthmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Women's Health"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunny_Choi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunny Choi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breakdancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sailing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disc jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_American_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pan American Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Pennsylvania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/olympians5-66b50341ad2ef.jpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.763xh;0,0.215xh&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801468", "eventUri": "eng-9801468", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 429, "textEnd": 437}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

It features spins, footwork, transitions and power moves.\n\nPower moves? They are as their name implies: a combination of complex sequences that require impressive strength. They often involve a breaker spinning their whole body on hands, back, shoulders or head.\n\nHOW IS BREAKING SCORED?\n\nThe competition consists of battles between two athletes. Each battle consists of a number of rounds. In each round one athlete performs first, then the other responds.\n\nEach round is judged against five criteria: technique, originality, execution, vocabulary - meaning the variety of moves, styles, and transitions - and musicality. Musicality refers to how well the breaker weaves together their moves to the beats.\n\nWhile the breaker knows the playlist of songs that the DJ select during the battle, they do not know the exact song they will be dancing to until it blares out of the loudspeakers.\n\nWHERE IS THE BREAKING TAKING PLACE? The breaking is being held at Place de la Concorde, one of Paris' main plaza's and the same site that held the BMX and skateboarding events. Breaking will make its Olympic debut in Paris but Los Angeles has already said it will not be part of its programme in 2028 and odds are it will not return when Brisbane hosts in 2032.\n\n(Reporting by Richard Lough; Editing by Alison Williams)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boroughs of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breakdancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Street dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Block party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrobatics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acrobatics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BMX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_de_la_Concorde", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Place de la Concorde"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skateboarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudspeaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loudspeaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disc jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Moving_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Moving Services", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 67}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801468", "eventUri": "eng-9801468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 0, "relevance": 1}

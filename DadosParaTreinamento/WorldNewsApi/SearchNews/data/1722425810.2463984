It seems like thousands of WA families just did. The question the state government needs to answer now is \u2014 why? And will these families get another shot at some extra relief? As of Monday, roughly 142,000 families had not cashed in on the WA government's Student Assistant Payment \u2014 a cost-of-living relief measure open to all parents and carers with school-age children. The $103 million scheme allowed families to claim $250 for every secondary school student and $150 for primary and kindergarten students. There was no means testing involved \u2014 it was for anyone with a school-aged kid in their care. The payments are supposed to help cover the costs associated with sending children to school \u2014 like school uniforms, books, excursions, stationary and other essential items. But if you are only just learning about these payments for the first time right now \u2014 sorry, it's too late. The deadline was midnight on June 28. On Monday, the government said more than $67 million in payments been distributed to 350,000 school students and their families. At that stage, around 29 per cent of eligible families had still not made a claim. Northern families not claiming And it seems like some of the state's most vulnerable families may not have accessed the payments. In response to questions asked in parliament last week, the government revealed that at that stage just 2,706 of the 7,088 eligible students in the Kimberley had accessed the payment \u2014 around 38 per cent. It was not much better in the Pilbara, where just under half of the 10,856 eligible families had accessed the payment. Why would this possibly be the case? Education Minister Tony Buti told ABC Pilbara this week that the government had done all it could to get the message out. \"We have been constantly putting the message out through various forums, we've sent out letters to all [school] principals,\" he said. One theory is that some people found the process for accessing the payments clunky and complicated. To access the payments, the government directed eligible people to the ServiceWA app, which it claimed was \"the fastest and most convenient method\". But in order to download the app, users first needed to download and set up an account with the separate myGovID app, which verifies people's identities through various documents like passports and driver's licences. Alternatively, people could also fill out an online form or lodge the application via the post, although they were warned this was less secure and would take much longer to process their payment. 'Painful and onerous' I asked one mother of a high-schooler in Perth how she found the process and she replied: \"Painful.\" This mother, an educated and tech-savvy professional, said she was grateful for the payment, which came through quickly after the application was lodged. But she did not understand why the process had to be so \"onerous\" and wondered how someone with limited digital literacy skills or internet access would have possibly managed. Another mum I asked on Thursday afternoon, who had two high-school children, had not made a claim. She said she had started the process but became overwhelmed by all the identification documents and apps involved and just gave up. Not everyone agreed. One comment, on Premier Roger Cook's Facebook page, implied the process had been a breeze. \"Just claimed easily with the app,\" the Facebook user wrote. \"Took about 7 mins including my logging into MyGov.\" Call for deadline extension On Monday, minister Buti said that if the government's payments were to reach 75 per cent of eligible carers that would be \"outstanding\". But without a school-by-school or electorate breakdown of which students have benefited, it is impossible to know whether these payments have reached the families who need it most. On Thursday, Liberal leader Libby Mettam called for the deadline to be extended. \"This cost-of-living relief has been a mess from the start and it is telling that in some regions less than half of the families have been able to attain these payments during a cost-of-living crisis,\" she said. The state government has vowed to redirect any of the unclaimed funds back into the pockets of WA families. It is not yet clear how it plans to do this. If it is through a means-tested approach next time, then it may mean that some families will end up with two much-needed support payments. Others \u2014 like some of those in the Kimberley, perhaps \u2014 may not be so lucky.

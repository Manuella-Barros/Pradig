McMaster, arguing he is insufficiently supportive of Israel and soft on Iran. Trump recently issued a rare public statement of support for McMaster.\n\nBannon's comments on North Korea, which contradict Trump's tough approach, could add to pressure on the president to fire him.

(AP) -- President Donald Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon said there's no military solution to the threat posed by North Korea and its nuclear ambitions, despite the president's recent pledge to answer further aggression with \"fire and fury.\"\n\nIn an interview with The American Prospect posted online Wednesday, Bannon told the liberal publication that the U.S. is losing the economic race against China. He also talks about purging his rivals from the Defense and State departments.\n\nBannon is also asked about the white supremacist movement, whose march on Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend led to deadly violence. He dismisses them as \"losers,\" ''a fringe element\" and \"a collection of clowns.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"There's no military solution (to North Korea's nuclear threats), forget it,\" Bannon says. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nTrump tweeted earlier Wednesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"made a very wise and well-reasoned decision\" by backing down after heightening fears of nuclear conflict in a series of combative threats, including against the U.S. territory of Guam.\n\nBannon also outlined his push for the U.S. to adopt a tougher stance on China trade, without waiting to see whether Beijing will help restrain Kim, as Trump has pressed China's leader to do. Trump also has lamented U.S. trade deficits with China.\n\n\"The economic war with China is everything,\" Bannon says. \"And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said Thursday both sides have benefited from trade.\n\nAsked about Bannon's comments, Hua said at a regular new briefing, \"There is no winner in a trade war. We hope the relevant people can refrain from dealing with a problem in the 21st century with a zero-sum mentality from the 19th or the 20th century.\"\n\nHua appealed for dialogue to \"preserve the sound and steady growth of China-U.S. relations.\"\n\nBannon was a key general election campaign adviser and has been a forceful but contentious presence in a divided White House. The former leader of conservative Breitbart News, Bannon has drawn fire from some of Trump's closest advisers, including son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nThe president is under renewed pressure to fire Bannon, who has survived earlier rounds of having fallen out of favor with Trump.\n\nEarlier this week, the president passed up an opportunity to offer a public vote of confidence in Bannon. Trump said he's a \"good person\" and not a racist, adding that \"we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\"\n\nThe latest anti-Bannon campaign comes as Trump faces mounting criticism for insisting that white supremacist groups and those who opposed them were both at fault for deadly violence last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nIn the interview, Bannon muses about getting rid of administration officials who disagree with his strategy toward China and North Korea and replacing them with \"hawks.\"\n\n\"We gotta do this.

Bannon never intended for his conversation with the magazine's co-editor Robert Kuttner to be published, according to a person familiar with Bannon who asked not to be identified. The publication comes as there is speculation that Bannon's job is peril, reportedly over Trump's discomfort with the credit Bannon gets for being the intellectual force behind the administration.\n\nLast month, White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci was removed just 10 days into the job after Scaramucci made lewd comments about Bannon and others in an interview with the New Yorker that he also later said was meant to be off the record. According to Kuttner, Bannon told him he reached out because he agreed with Kuttner's past writings on China. Bannon rarely speaks with reporters on the record, let alone a liberal-leaning magazine.\n\nYou May Also Like To Watch:\n\nIn a telephone interview, Kuttner said the issue of whether his conversation with Bannon was off the record never came up, even indirectly. \"He phoned and began by saying how much he agreed with my work on trade and it just went from there. He knows the rules. It's on the record unless someone puts it off.\"\"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" Bannon is quoted as saying in the interview about his fueds with other senior officials over China. He pointed to fellow Goldman Sachs Group Inc. alumni, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, who are pushing for a softer stance on trade with China. \"We're still fighting. There's Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.\"\n\nThe interview comes as the White House has struggled to respond to Saturday's violent racial protests in Charlottesville, Virginia and as some aides -- including Cohn -- have objected in private to Trump's restrained denunciations of white supremacists. Bannon approved of the president's approach, said officials in the administration who asked not to be named. Bannon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the interview, Bannon said his rivals in the administration are \"wetting themselves\" as he works to undermine their influence with the president and he bragged about working to get some of them ousted. There has been speculation in recent days that Bannon could be in danger of losing his job, though Trump spoke in supportive terms about about him at Tuesday's press conference.\n\nBannon said he favors pushing back against Chinese economic expansion, arguing only one country will emerge as a leader from what he described as an \"economic war.\" \"To me, the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover,\" he said.\n\nHe advocated for the U.S. to file a complaint under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act -- which allows for sanctions against countries that violate trade agreements or engage in unfair trade practices -- as well as follow-up complaints against steel and aluminum dumping, Kuttner wrote.\n\n\"We're going to run the tables on these guys. We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us,\" Bannon said.\n\nBannon also dismissed speculation that the U.S might consider using military action against North Korea to get the regime there to abandon its intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear weapon programs. Trump recently vowed to deliver \"fire and fury\" onto North Korea.\n\n\"There's no military solution, forget it,\" Bannon said. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nIn the interview, Bannon also dismissed the so called far-right that he helped organize and inflame when he led Breitbart News and during Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more,\" he said. \"These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\nStill, Bannon said he's fine with the issue of race taking over the national conversation. \"The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" he is quoted as saying. \"I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"", "id": "9644478", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Steve Bannon tells

The publication comes as there is speculation that Bannon's job is peril, reportedly over Trump's discomfort with the credit Bannon gets for being the intellectual force behind the administration.\n\nLast month, White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci was removed just 10 days into the job after Scaramucci made lewd comments about Bannon and others in an interview with the New Yorker that he also later said was meant to be off the record.\n\nAccording to Kuttner, Bannon told him he reached out because he agreed with Kuttner's past writings on China. Bannon rarely speaks with reporters on the record, let alone a liberal-leaning magazine.\n\nIn a telephone interview, Kuttner said the issue of whether his conversation with Bannon was off the record never came up, even indirectly. \"He phoned and began by saying how much he agreed with my work on trade and it just went from there. He knows the rules. It's on the record unless someone puts it off.\"\n\n\"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" Bannon is quoted as saying in the interview about his feuds with other senior officials over China. He pointed to fellow Goldman Sachs alumni, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, who are pushing for a softer stance on trade with China. \"We're still fighting. There's Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.\"\n\nThe interview comes as the White House has struggled to respond to Saturday's violent racial protests in Charlottesville, Virginia and as some aides -- including Cohn -- have objected in private to Trump's restrained denunciations of white supremacists. Bannon approved of the president's approach, said officials in the administration who asked not to be named. Bannon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the interview, Bannon said his rivals in the administration are \"wetting themselves\" as he works to undermine their influence with the president and he bragged about working to get some of them ousted. There has been speculation in recent days that Bannon could be in danger of losing his job, though Trump spoke in supportive terms about about him at Tuesday's press conference.\n\nBannon said he favors pushing back against Chinese economic expansion, arguing only one country will emerge as a leader from what he described as an \"economic war.\"\n\n\"To me, the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover,\" he said.\n\nHe advocated for the U.S. to file a complaint under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act -- which allows for sanctions against countries that violate trade agreements or engage in unfair trade practices -- as well as follow-up complaints against steel and aluminum dumping, Kuttner wrote.\n\n\"We're going to run the tables on these guys. We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us,\" Bannon said.\n\nBannon also dismissed speculation that the U.S might consider using military action against North Korea to get the regime there to abandon its intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear weapon programs. Trump recently vowed to deliver \"fire and fury\" onto North Korea.\n\n\"There's no military solution, forget it,\" Bannon said. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nIn the interview, Bannon also dismissed the so called far-right that he helped organize and inflame when he led Breitbart News and during Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism - it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more,\" he said. \"These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\nStill, Bannon said he's fine with the issue of race taking over the national conversation. \"The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" he is quoted as saying. \"I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"", "id": "9679805", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Steve Bannon says

There have been increasing calls from the left and the right for the removal of the former editor of Breitbart News. When Trump was asked at a press conference this week if the chief strategist would remain in his position, the president said: \"We'll see.\"\n\nIt is unclear why Bannon chose to call Kuttner, who wrote that he had not requested the interview and was \"stunned\" to hear from him. However after publication stories circulated that Bannon was unaware he was providing an interview.\n\nThere have been recent reports of internal conflicts and power struggles within the administration, and Bannon made the call amid an intense backlash related to Trump's links to the far right and the president's comments that there were \"very fine people\" at a violent white nationalist protest in Charlottesville.\n\nIn the American Prospect story, headlined \"Steve Bannon, unrepentant\", Trump's top aide said: \"We're at economic war with China. It's in all their literature. They're not shy about saying what they're doing. One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path. On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow.\"\n\nContradicting Trump's threats of \"fire and fury\" on North Korea, Bannon said: \"There's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats], forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nBannon also discussed his \"battle inside the administration to take a harder line on China trade\", Kuttner wrote. Asked about his adversaries at the US departments of state and defense, Bannon responded, \"Oh, they're wetting themselves.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I'm changing out people at east Asian defense; I'm getting hawks in. I'm getting Susan Thornton [acting head of east Asian and Pacific affairs] out at state.\"\n\nThe State Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday night. At the time of writing Susan Thornton was still listed in her position.\n\nKuttner also asked Bannon about the \"ugly white nationalism epitomized by the racist violence in Charlottesville and Trump's reluctance to condemn it\". Heather Heyer, a civil rights activist, was killed when a man alleged to be a white nationalist drove a car into a crowd of counter protesters on Saturday.\n\nBannon dismissed the far right as \"irrelevant\", Kuttner wrote, quoting the Trump aide as saying: \"Ethno-nationalism - it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more ... These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\nRegarding the Democrats, Bannon said: \"The longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nKuttner wrote that he had never spoken to Bannon before and that the question of whether the call was on or off the record never came up.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, Trump's short-lived communications director, was recently fired after he called up a reporter and launched a foul-mouthed rant against senior colleagues, including Bannon.\n\nBannon has attracted significant controversy during his time at the White House, where he was blamed for the failed implementation of the travel ban, which was quickly blocked by the courts.\n\nIt has been reported that the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his wife, Ivanka Trump, have long urged Bannon's dismissal.\n\nThe president tried to downplay Bannon's influence on his campaign at the recent press conference, saying, \"I like Mr Bannon. He's a friend of mine.

Just last week, Trump pledged to answer North Korean aggression with \"fire and fury.\"\n\nIn an interview with The American Prospect posted online Wednesday, Bannon tells the liberal publication that the U.S. is losing the economic race against China and talks about purging his rivals from the Defense and State departments.\n\nAsked about the white supremacist movement, whose march on Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend led to deadly violence, Bannon dismisses them as \"losers,\" ''a fringe element\" and \"a collection of clowns.\"\n\nThe White House and a representative for Bannon did not immediately respond to requests for comment on what is viewed as an unusual interview by one of the most contentious members of Trump's inner circle who is again facing an uncertain future in the White House.\n\nTrump passed up an opportunity this week to offer a public vote of confidence in Bannon, who was a key campaign adviser during the general election and has become a forceful presence in a divided White House. But the former leader of the conservative Breitbart News has drawn fire from some of Trump's closest advisers, including son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nThe latest anti-Bannon campaign comes as Trump finds himself increasingly isolated, except among his core supporters, for insisting that white supremacist groups and those who opposed them were both at fault in Charlottesville.\n\nOthers believe Bannon is behind a campaign conservative groups and the Breitbart website are waging against national security adviser H.R. McMaster, arguing he is insufficiently supportive of Israel and soft on Iran. Trump recently issued a rare public statement of support for McMaster.\n\nBannon's comments on North Korea, which contradict Trump's tough approach, could add to pressure on the president to fire him. Bannon has survived earlier rounds of having fallen out of favor with Trump, who is irked by perceptions that Bannon was the mastermind of Trump's winning campaign and that he guides policy in the White House.\n\n\"There's no military solution (to North Korea's nuclear threats), forget it,\" Bannon says. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nTrump tweeted early Wednesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"made a very wise and well-reasoned decision\" by backing down after heightening fears of nuclear conflict in a series of combative threats, including against the U.S. territory of Guam.\n\nBannon also outlined his push for the U.S. to adopt a tougher stance on China trade -- without waiting to see whether Beijing will help restrain Kim as Trump has pressed China's leader to do. Trump also has lamented U.S. trade deficits with China.\n\n\"The economic war with China is everything,\" Bannon says. \"And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said Thursday that both sides have benefited from trade.\n\nAsked at a regular news briefing about Bannon's comments, Hua said \"there is no winner in a trade war. We hope the relevant people can refrain from dealing with a problem in the 21st century with a zero-sum mentality from the 19th or the 20th century.\"\n\nHua appealed for dialogue to \"preserve the sound and steady growth of China-U.S. relations.\"\n\nIn the interview, Bannon muses about getting rid of administration officials who disagree with his stance on China and North Korea and replacing them with \"hawks.\"\n\n\"We gotta do this. The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy,\" Bannon says. \"Don't get me wrong.

There's Treasury and [National Economic Council chair] Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.\"\n\n\"We gotta do this,\" Bannon continued about taking an aggressive stance against China on trade issues. \"The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy. Don't get me wrong. It's like, every day.\"\n\n\"To me, the economic war with China is everything,\" Bannon told Kuttner. \"And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nBannon's call to Kuttner, who says he'd never spoken to the former Breitbart publisher before, came as Bannon's future in the White House is uncertain. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said \"we'll see\" what happens with Bannon, in the middle of a chaotic press that blamed \"both sides\" for violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend.\n\n\"Well we'll see - look, like, I like Mr. Bannon, he's a friend of mine, but Mr. Bannon came on very late, you know that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I went through 17 senators, governors, and I won all the primaries. Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that, and I like him, he is a good man, he is not a racist, I can tell you that. He's a good person. He actually gets a very unfair press in that regard, but we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon, but he's a good person, and I think the press treats him frankly very unfairly.\"\n\nBannon, who in the past has bragged about his connections to the \"alt-right,\" dismissed the far-right protesters as an irrelevant \"fringe element.\"\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers,\" Bannon said. \"It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more.\"\n\n\"These guys are a collection of clowns,\" the president's chief strategist added.\n\nBannon also said pursuing a military option with North Korea in the face of its nuclear threats is useless.\n\n\"There's no military solution, forget it,\" Bannon said. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul [South Korea] don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"", "id": "9591417", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "His future in jeopardy, Bannon attacks administration rivals", "image":

Lee -- a hero of the slave-holding Confederacy..\n\nBut in the interview, Bannon seemed to dismiss the groups as fringe elements, and blamed the media for giving them outsized coverage.\n\nHundreds of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and members of the \"alt-right\" march down East Market Street toward Lee Park during the \"Unite the Right\" rally August 12, 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia.

I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more,\" he's quoted saying. \"These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\nTrump has come under fire at home and abroad for insisting that white supremacist groups and those who opposed them were both at fault for deadly violence last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia. The statements, including a contentious Tuesday press conference during which he insisted that \"both sides\" were at fault, have been widely seen as giving support to white supremacist groups, many of whose leaders have expressed satisfaction with the president.\n\nAccording to a report from insider news platform Axios, Bannon has been delighted by Trump's statements -- dubbing them a victory for the nationalist camp in the White House over the \"globalists\" he fears are trying to drag the president towards a conventional line.\n\nIn this April 9, 2017, file photo, White House chief strategist Steve Bannon steps off Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base, Md. (AP/Alex Brandon)\n\nAs the head of the Brietbart news organization, Bannon gave white nationalism a high-profile platform, and his senior position with Trump is regarded as a sign of close ties between the movement and the administration.\n\nA forceful but contentious presence in a divided White House, Bannon has drawn fire from some of Trump's closest advisers, including son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nThe president is under renewed pressure to fire Bannon, who has survived earlier rounds of having fallen out of favor with Trump.\n\nAt the Tuesday press conference, the president also passed up an opportunity to offer a public vote of confidence in Bannon. Trump said he's a \"good person\" and not a racist, adding that \"we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\"\n\nMuch of the interview was devoted to Bannon's platform of economic nationalism and tensions with North Korea.\n\nIn the interview, Bannon mused about getting rid of administration officials who disagree with his strategy toward China and North Korea and replacing them with \"hawks.\"\n\n\"We gotta do this. The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy,\" Bannon said. \"Don't get me wrong.

Trump also has lamented US trade deficits with China.\n\n\"The economic war with China is everything,\" Bannon said. \"And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nAFP contributed to this report.", "id":

But the former leader of the conservative Breitbart News has drawn fire from some of Trump's closest advisers, including son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nThe latest anti-Bannon campaign comes as Trump finds himself increasingly isolated, except among his core supporters, for insisting that white supremacist groups and those who opposed them were both at fault in Charlottesville.\n\nOthers believe Bannon is behind a campaign conservative groups and the Breitbart website are waging against national security adviser H.R. McMaster, arguing he is insufficiently supportive of Israel and soft on Iran. Trump recently issued a rare public statement of support for McMaster.\n\nBannon's comments on North Korea, which contradict Trump's tough approach, could add to pressure on the president to fire him. Bannon has survived earlier rounds of having fallen out of favour with Trump, who is irked by perceptions that Bannon was the mastermind of Trump's winning campaign and that he guides policy in the White House.\n\n\"There's no military solution (to North Korea's nuclear threats), forget it,\" Bannon says. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nTrump tweeted early Wednesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"made a very wise and well-reasoned decision\" by backing down after heightening fears of nuclear conflict in a series of combative threats, including against the U.S. territory of Guam.\n\nBannon also outlined his push for the U.S. to adopt a tougher stance on China trade -- without waiting to see whether Beijing will help restrain Kim as Trump has pressed China's leader to do. Trump also has lamented U.S. trade deficits with China.\n\n\"The economic war with China is everything,\" Bannon says. \"And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said Thursday that both sides have benefited from trade.\n\nAsked at a regular news briefing about Bannon's comments, Hua said \"there is no winner in a trade war. We hope the relevant people can refrain from dealing with a problem in the 21st century with a zero-sum mentality from the 19th or the 20th century.\"\n\nHua appealed for dialogue to \"preserve the sound and steady growth of China-U.S. relations.\"\n\nIn the interview, Bannon muses about getting rid of administration officials who disagree with his stance on China and North Korea and replacing them with \"hawks.\"\n\n\"We gotta do this.

(AP) -- Contradicting a boss already under pressure to fire him, President Donald Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon says there's no military solution to the threat posed by North Korea and its nuclear ambitions. Just last week, Trump pledged to answer North Korean aggression with \"fire and fury.\"\n\nIn an interview with The American Prospect posted online Wednesday, Bannon tells the liberal publication that the U.S. is losing the economic race against China and talks about purging his rivals from the Defense and State departments.\n\nAsked about the white supremacist movement, whose march on Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend led to deadly violence, Bannon dismisses them as \"losers,\" \"a fringe element\" and \"a collection of clowns.\"\n\nA White House spokeswoman said \"Bannon's comments stand on their own.\"\n\nIn a separate interview with the DailyMail.com, Bannon said his comments to The American Prospect \"drew fire away from\" Trump and that he successfully \"changed the (media) narrative\" around Trump with the earlier interview.\n\nBannon, one of the most contentious members of Trump's inner circle, is again facing an uncertain future in the White House, a situation that could be further complicated by his decision to give the initial interview.\n\nTrump passed up an opportunity this week to offer a public vote of confidence in Bannon, who was a key campaign adviser during the general election and has become a forceful presence in a divided White House. But the former leader of the conservative Breitbart News has drawn fire from some of Trump's closest advisers, including son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nThe latest anti-Bannon campaign comes as Trump finds himself increasingly isolated, except among his core supporters, for insisting that white supremacist groups and those who opposed them were both at fault in Charlottesville.\n\nOthers believe Bannon is behind a campaign conservative groups and the Breitbart website are waging against national security adviser H.R. McMaster, arguing he is insufficiently supportive of Israel and soft on Iran. Trump recently issued a rare public statement of support for McMaster.\n\nBannon's comments on North Korea, which contradict Trump's tough approach, could add to pressure on the president to fire him. Bannon has survived earlier rounds of having fallen out of favor with Trump, who is irked by perceptions that Bannon was the mastermind of Trump's winning campaign and that he guides policy in the White House.\n\n\"There's no military solution (to North Korea's nuclear threats), forget it,\" Bannon says. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nTrump tweeted early Wednesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"made a very wise and well-reasoned decision\" by backing down after heightening fears of nuclear conflict in a series of combative threats, including against the U.S. territory of Guam.\n\nBannon also outlined his push for the U.S. to adopt a tougher stance on China trade -- without waiting to see whether Beijing will help restrain Kim as Trump has pressed China's leader to do. Trump also has lamented U.S. trade deficits with China.\n\n\"The economic war with China is everything,\" Bannon says. \"And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said Thursday that both sides have benefited from trade.\n\nAsked at a regular news briefing about Bannon's comments, Hua said \"there is no winner in a trade war. We hope the relevant people can refrain from dealing with a problem in the 21st century with a zero-sum mentality from the 19th or the 20th century.\"\n\nHua appealed for dialogue to \"preserve the sound and steady growth of China-U.S. relations.\"\n\nIn the interview, Bannon muses about getting rid of administration officials who disagree with his stance on China and North Korea and replacing them with \"hawks.\"\n\n\"We gotta do this. The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy,\" Bannon says.\n\nOne official Bannon mentioned by name is Susan Thornton, currently America's top diplomat for Asia.\n\nOn Thursday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson signaled support for his senior adviser. After greeting Japan's defense chief and top diplomat at the State Department, Tillerson pointedly shook Thornton's hand in front of the cameras as their meeting began.", "id": "9741139", "details":

But the former leader of the conservative Breitbart News has drawn fire from some of Trump's closest advisers, including son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nThe latest anti-Bannon campaign comes as Trump finds himself increasingly isolated, except among his core supporters, for insisting that white supremacist groups and those who opposed them were both at fault in Charlottesville.\n\nOthers believe Bannon is behind a campaign conservative groups and the Breitbart website are waging against national security adviser H.R. McMaster, arguing he is insufficiently supportive of Israel and soft on Iran. Trump recently issued a rare public statement of support for McMaster.\n\nBannon's comments on North Korea, which contradict Trump's tough approach, could add to pressure on the president to fire him.

The publication comes as there is speculation that Bannon's job is peril, reportedly over Trump's discomfort with the credit Bannon gets for being the intellectual force behind the administration.\n\nLast month, White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci was removed just 10 days into the job after Scaramucci made lewd comments about Bannon and others in an interview with the New Yorker that he also later said was meant to be off the record.\n\nAccording to Kuttner, Bannon told him he reached out because he agreed with Kuttner's past writings on China. Bannon rarely speaks with reporters on the record, let alone a liberal-leaning magazine.\n\nIn a telephone interview, Kuttner said the issue of whether his conversation with Bannon was off the record never came up, even indirectly. \"He phoned and began by saying how much he agreed with my work on trade and it just went from there. He knows the rules. It's on the record unless someone puts it off.\"\n\n\"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" Bannon is quoted as saying in the interview about his fueds with other senior officials over China. He pointed to fellow Goldman Sachs Group Inc. alumni, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, who are pushing for a softer stance on trade with China. \"We're still fighting. There's Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.\"\n\nThe interview comes as the White House has struggled to respond to Saturday's violent racial protests in Charlottesville, Virginia and as some aides -- including Cohn -- have objected in private to Trump's restrained denunciations of white supremacists. Bannon approved of the president's approach, said officials in the administration who asked not to be named. Bannon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the interview, Bannon said his rivals in the administration are \"wetting themselves\" as he works to undermine their influence with the president and he bragged about working to get some of them ousted. There has been speculation in recent days that Bannon could be in danger of losing his job, though Trump spoke in supportive terms about about him at Tuesday's press conference.\n\nBannon said he favors pushing back against Chinese economic expansion, arguing only one country will emerge as a leader from what he described as an \"economic war.\"\n\n\"To me, the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover,\" he said.\n\nHe advocated for the U.S. to file a complaint under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act -- which allows for sanctions against countries that violate trade agreements or engage in unfair trade practices -- as well as follow-up complaints against steel and aluminum dumping, Kuttner wrote.\n\n\"We're going to run the tables on these guys. We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us,\" Bannon said.\n\nBannon also dismissed speculation that the U.S might consider using military action against North Korea to get the regime there to abandon its intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear weapon programs. Trump recently vowed to deliver \"fire and fury\" onto North Korea.\n\n\"There's no military solution, forget it,\" Bannon said. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nIn the interview, Bannon also dismissed the so called far-right that he helped organize and inflame when he led Breitbart News and during Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more,\" he said. \"These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\nStill, Bannon said he's fine with the issue of race taking over the national conversation. \"The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" he is quoted as saying. \"I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\n--With assistance from Margaret Talev", "id": "9636614", "details": {}, "date":

(AP) -- Contradicting a boss already under pressure to fire him, President Donald Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon says there's no military solution to the threat posed by North Korea and its nuclear ambitions. Just last week, Trump pledged to answer North Korean aggression with \"fire and fury.\"\n\nIn an interview with The American Prospect posted online Wednesday, Bannon tells the liberal publication that the U.S. is losing the economic race against China and talks about purging his rivals from the Defense and State departments.\n\nAsked about the white supremacist movement, whose march on Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend led to deadly violence, Bannon dismisses them as \"losers,\" ''a fringe element\" and \"a collection of clowns.\"\n\nThe White House and a representative for Bannon did not immediately respond to requests for comment on what is viewed as an unusual interview by one of the most contentious members of Trump's inner circle who is again facing an uncertain future in the White House.\n\nTrump passed up an opportunity this week to offer a public vote of confidence in Bannon, who was a key campaign adviser during the general election and has become a forceful presence in a divided White House. But the former leader of the conservative Breitbart News has drawn fire from some of Trump's closest advisers, including son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nThe latest anti-Bannon campaign comes as Trump finds himself increasingly isolated, except among his core supporters, for insisting that white supremacist groups and those who opposed them were both at fault in Charlottesville.\n\nOthers believe Bannon is behind a campaign conservative groups and the Breitbart website are waging against national security adviser H.R. McMaster, arguing he is insufficiently supportive of Israel and soft on Iran. Trump recently issued a rare public statement of support for McMaster.\n\nBannon's comments on North Korea, which contradict Trump's tough approach, could add to pressure on the president to fire him. Bannon has survived earlier rounds of having fallen out of favor with Trump, who is irked by perceptions that Bannon was the mastermind of Trump's winning campaign and that he guides policy in the White House.\n\n\"There's no military solution (to North Korea's nuclear threats), forget it,\" Bannon says. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nTrump tweeted early Wednesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"made a very wise and well-reasoned decision\" by backing down after heightening fears of nuclear conflict in a series of combative threats, including against the U.S. territory of Guam.\n\nBannon also outlined his push for the U.S. to adopt a tougher stance on China trade -- without waiting to see whether Beijing will help restrain Kim as Trump has pressed China's leader to do. Trump also has lamented U.S. trade deficits with China.\n\n\"The economic war with China is everything,\" Bannon says. \"And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said Thursday that both sides have benefited from trade.\n\nAsked at a regular news briefing about Bannon's comments, Hua said \"there is no winner in a trade war. We hope the relevant people can refrain from dealing with a problem in the 21st century with a zero-sum mentality from the 19th or the 20th century.\"\n\nHua appealed for dialogue to \"preserve the sound and steady growth of China-U.S. relations.\"\n\nIn the interview, Bannon muses about getting rid of administration officials who disagree with his stance on China and North Korea and replacing them with \"hawks.\"\n\n\"We gotta do this. The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy,\" Bannon says. \"Don't get me wrong. It's like, every day.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap", "id": "9705723", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump aide: No military

One, to The New York Times, which was abhorrent. The second, to the progressive news magazine, The American Prospect. It's the latter that's getting all the attention, so much attention, it crashed the magazine's servers.\n\nBut why? Bannon's job reportedly is on thin ice. The violence in Charlottesville has turned up the heat on the neo-Nazi, white nationalist wing of the Trump White House, and in Tuesday's disastrous press event the president refused to say if Bannon's job was safe.\n\n\"We'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nSo what happened Wednesday? How damaging was Bannon's interview with The American Prospect?\n\nHere's what a Bannon colleague in the White House told Axios.\n\n\"Since Steve apparently enjoys casually undermining U.S. national security, I'll put this in terms he'll understand: This is DEFCON 1-level bad.\"\n\nHere's what has Americans stunned:\n\nContrary to Trump's threat of fire and fury, Bannon said: \"There's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats], forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nSo Bannon feels totally comfortable undermining U.S. foreign policy and national security. He gave away America's leverage. If you think it wasn't intentional, guess again.\n\n\"I was a little stunned to get an email from Bannon's assistant midday Tuesday, just as all hell was breaking loose once again about Charlottesville, saying that Bannon wished to meet with me,\" The American Prospect's Robert Kuttner reported.\n\nIn other words, Bannon heard Trump's refusal to offer him support, and has decided to go out in a blaze of glory - whatever the cost. Remember, Bannon is a founding board member of the far right wing website Breitbart and served as its publisher until Trump tapped him to run his flailing presidential campaign. And remember, Bannon is a strategist.\n\nThat was not the end of the interview.\n\nBannon also said, \"We're at economic war with China,\" and if we don't get the upper hand in five or ten years we'll have lost.\n\nAll of this, frankly, sounds like giving aid and comfort to the enemy, but that's for others to decide.\n\nIf revealing the White House game plan and beliefs about China and North Korea weren't enough, Bannon also went after Trump's core base of white nationalists.\n\nI asked Bannon about the connection between his program of economic nationalism and the ugly white nationalism epitomized by the racist violence in Charlottesville and Trump's reluctance to condemn it. Bannon, after all, was the architect of the strategy of using Breitbart to heat up white nationalism and then rely on the radical right as Trump's base.\n\nHe dismissed the far right as irrelevant and sidestepped his own role in cultivating it: \"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more.\"\n\n\"The Democrats,\" he said, \"the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nThat echoes Bannon's remarks in the interview he gave to The New York Times, which are stunning:\n\nStephen K. Bannon, the president's chief strategist, said in an interview that if Democrats want to fight over Confederate monuments and attack Mr. Trump as a bigot, that was a fight the president would win.\n\n\"President Trump, by asking, 'Where does this all end' -- Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln -- connects with the American people about their history, culture and traditions,\" he said.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Mr. Bannon added. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\nBannon, Axios notes, now says he didn't know he was giving an interview. Kuttner makes clear Bannon contacted him out of the blue, they have never spoken before, Bannon did not say it was off the record, and did not even mention it, and, most importantly, Bannon is a media guru and former publisher.", "id": "9762529", "details": {"gpCnt": 3}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "'This Is DEFCON 1-Level Bad': Steve Bannon Accused of Giving Interview 'Casually Undermining US

(AP) -- Contradicting a boss already under pressure to fire him, President Donald Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon says there's no military solution to the threat posed by North Korea and its nuclear ambitions. Just last week, Trump pledged to answer North Korean aggression with \"fire and fury.\"\n\nIn an interview with The American Prospect posted online Wednesday, Bannon tells the liberal publication that the U.S. is losing the economic race against China and talks about purging his rivals from the Defense and State departments.\n\nAsked about the white supremacist movement, whose march on Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend led to deadly violence, Bannon dismisses them as \"losers,\" ''a fringe element\" and \"a collection of clowns.\"\n\nA White House spokeswoman said \"Bannon's comments stand on their own.\"\n\nIn a separate interview with the DailyMail.com, Bannon said his comments to The American Prospect \"drew fire away from\" Trump and that he successfully \"changed the (media) narrative\" around Trump with the earlier interview.\n\nBannon, one of the most contentious members of Trump's inner circle, is again facing an uncertain future in the White House, a situation that could be further complicated by his decision to give the initial interview.\n\nTrump passed up an opportunity this week to offer a public vote of confidence in Bannon, who was a key campaign adviser during the general election and has become a forceful presence in a divided White House. But the former leader of the conservative Breitbart News has drawn fire from some of Trump's closest advisers, including son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nThe latest anti-Bannon campaign comes as Trump finds himself increasingly isolated, except among his core supporters, for insisting that white supremacist groups and those who opposed them were both at fault in Charlottesville.\n\nOthers believe Bannon is behind a campaign conservative groups and the Breitbart website are waging against national security adviser H.R. McMaster, arguing he is insufficiently supportive of Israel and soft on Iran. Trump recently issued a rare public statement of support for McMaster.\n\nBannon's comments on North Korea, which contradict Trump's tough approach, could add to pressure on the president to fire him. Bannon has survived earlier rounds of having fallen out of favor with Trump, who is irked by perceptions that Bannon was the mastermind of Trump's winning campaign and that he guides policy in the White House.\n\n\"There's no military solution (to North Korea's nuclear threats), forget it,\" Bannon says. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nTrump tweeted early Wednesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"made a very wise and well-reasoned decision\" by backing down after heightening fears of nuclear conflict in a series of combative threats, including against the U.S. territory of Guam.\n\nBannon also outlined his push for the U.S. to adopt a tougher stance on China trade -- without waiting to see whether Beijing will help restrain Kim as Trump has pressed China's leader to do. Trump also has lamented U.S. trade deficits with China.\n\n\"The economic war with China is everything,\" Bannon says. \"And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said Thursday that both sides have benefited from trade.\n\nAsked at a regular news briefing about Bannon's comments, Hua said \"there is no winner in a trade war. We hope the relevant people can refrain from dealing with a problem in the 21st century with a zero-sum mentality from the 19th or the 20th century.\"\n\nHua appealed for dialogue to \"preserve the sound and steady growth of China-U.S. relations.\"\n\nIn the interview, Bannon muses about getting rid of administration officials who disagree with his stance on China and North Korea and replacing them with \"hawks.\"\n\n\"We gotta do this. The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy,\" Bannon says.\n\nOne official Bannon mentioned by name is Susan Thornton, currently America's top diplomat for Asia.\n\nOn Thursday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson signaled support for his senior adviser. After greeting Japan's defense chief and top diplomat at the State Department, Tillerson pointedly shook Thornton's hand in front of the cameras as their meeting began.\n\n-- -- --\n\nAssociated Press

He also talks about purging his rivals from the Defense and State departments.\n\nBannon is also asked about the white supremacist movement, whose march on Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend led to deadly violence. He dismisses them as \"losers,\" \"a fringe element\" and \"a collection of clowns.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"There's no military solution (to North Korea's nuclear threats), forget it,\" Bannon says. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nTrump tweeted earlier yesterday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"made a very wise and well-reasoned decision\" by backing down after heightening fears of nuclear conflict in a series of combative threats, including against the US territory of Guam.\n\nBannon also outlined his push for the US to adopt a tougher stance on China trade, without waiting to see whether Beijing will help restrain Kim, as Trump has pressed China's leader to do. Trump also has lamented US trade deficits with China.\n\n\"The economic war with China is everything,\" Bannon says.\n\n\"And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said yesterday both sides have benefited from trade.\n\nAsked about Bannon's comments, Hua said at a regular new briefing, \"There is no winner in a trade war. We hope the relevant people can refrain from dealing with a problem in the 21st century with a zero-sum mentality from the 19th or the 20th century.\"\n\nHua appealed for dialogue to \"preserve the sound and steady growth of China-US relations.\"\n\nBannon was a key general election campaign adviser and has been a forceful but contentious presence in a divided White House. The former leader of conservative Breitbart News, Bannon has drawn fire from some of Trump's closest advisers, including son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nThe president is under renewed pressure to fire Bannon, who has survived earlier rounds of having fallen out of favor with Trump.(AP)\n\nEarlier this week, the President passed up an opportunity to offer a public vote of confidence in Bannon. Trump said he's a \"good person\" and not a racist, adding that \"we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\"\n\nThe latest anti-Bannon campaign comes as Trump faces mounting criticism for insisting that white supremacist groups and those who opposed them were both at fault for deadly violence last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.", "id": "9682718", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17",

He pointed to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, both alumni of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. who are pushing for a softer stance on trade with China. \"We're still fighting. There's Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.\"\n\nThe interview was conducted Tuesday by the magazine's co-editor Robert Kuttner, who said Bannon told him he reached out because he agreed with Kuttner's past writings on China. Bannon rarely speaks with reporters on the record, let alone a liberal-leaning magazine.\n\nThe interview with Bannon comes as the White House has struggled to respond to Saturday's violent racial protests in Charlottesville, Va., and as some aides -- including Cohn -- have objected in private to Trump's restrained denunciations of white supremacists. Bannon approved of the president's approach, officials in the administration who asked not to be identified have said.\n\nBannon, who also once worked at Goldman Sachs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the interview.\n\nIn the interview Bannon said his rivals in the administration are \"wetting themselves\" as he works to undermine their influence with the president and he bragged about working to get some of them ousted. There has been speculation in recent days that Bannon could be in danger of losing his job, though Trump spoke in supportive terms about ahim at Tuesday's news conference.\n\nBannon said he favors pushing back against Chinese economic expansion, arguing only one country will emerge as a leader from what he described as an \"economic war.\"\n\n\"To me, the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover,\" he said.\n\nHe advocated for the United States to file a complaint under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act -- which allows for sanctions against countries that violate trade agreements or engage in unfair trade practices -- as well as follow-up complaints against steel and aluminum dumping, Kuttner wrote.\n\n\"We're going to run the tables on these guys. We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us,\" Bannon said.\n\nBannon also dismissed speculation that the U.S might consider using military action against North Korea to get the regime there to abandon its intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear weapon programs. Trump recently vowed to deliver \"fire and fury\" onto North Korea.\n\n\"There's no military solution, forget it,\" Bannon said. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nBannon also was dismissive in the interview of the so called far-right that he helped organize and inflame when he led Breitbart News and during Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more,\" he said. \"These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\nStill, Bannon said he's fine with the issue of race taking over the national conversation. \"The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" he is quoted as saying. \"I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Reuters cited three White House officials earlier Wednesday who said

(AP) - Contradicting a boss already under pressure to fire him, President Donald Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon says there's no military solution to the threat posed by North Korea and its nuclear ambitions. Just last week, Trump pledged to answer North Korean aggression with \"fire and fury.\"\n\nIn an interview with The American Prospect posted online Wednesday, Bannon tells the liberal publication that the U.S. is losing the economic race against China and talks about purging his rivals from the Defense and State departments.\n\nAsked about the white supremacist movement, whose march on Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend led to deadly violence, Bannon dismisses them as \"losers,\" ''a fringe element\" and \"a collection of clowns.\"\n\nThe White House and a representative for Bannon did not immediately respond to requests for comment on what is viewed as an unusual interview by one of the most contentious members of Trump's inner circle who is again facing an uncertain future in the White House.\n\nTrump passed up an opportunity this week to offer a public vote of confidence in Bannon, who was a key campaign adviser during the general election and has become a forceful presence in a divided White House. But the former leader of the conservative Breitbart News has drawn fire from some of Trump's closest advisers, including son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nThe latest anti-Bannon campaign comes as Trump finds himself increasingly isolated, except among his core supporters, for insisting that white supremacist groups and those who opposed them were both at fault in Charlottesville.\n\nOthers believe Bannon is behind a campaign conservative groups and the Breitbart website are waging against national security adviser H.R. McMaster, arguing he is insufficiently supportive of Israel and soft on Iran. Trump recently issued a rare public statement of support for McMaster.\n\nBannon's comments on North Korea, which contradict Trump's tough approach, could add to pressure on the president to fire him. Bannon has survived earlier rounds of having fallen out of favor with Trump, who is irked by perceptions that Bannon was the mastermind of Trump's winning campaign and that he guides policy in the White House.\n\n\"There's no military solution (to North Korea's nuclear threats), forget it,\" Bannon says. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nTrump tweeted early Wednesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"made a very wise and well-reasoned decision\" by backing down after heightening fears of nuclear conflict in a series of combative threats, including against the U.S. territory of Guam.\n\nBannon also outlined his push for the U.S. to adopt a tougher stance on China trade - without waiting to see whether Beijing will help restrain Kim as Trump has pressed China's leader to do. Trump also has lamented U.S. trade deficits with China.\n\n\"The economic war with China is everything,\" Bannon says. \"And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said Thursday that both sides have benefited from trade.\n\nAsked at a regular news briefing about Bannon's comments, Hua said \"there is no winner in a trade war. We hope the relevant people can refrain from dealing with a problem in the 21st century with a zero-sum mentality from the 19th or the 20th century.\"\n\nHua appealed for dialogue to \"preserve the sound and steady growth of China-U.S. relations.\"\n\nIn the interview, Bannon muses about getting rid of administration officials who disagree with his stance on China and North Korea and replacing them with \"hawks.\"\n\n\"We gotta do this. The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy,\" Bannon says. \"Don't get me wrong. It's like, every day.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Photo by Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nBRIDGEWATER, N.J. -- President Donald Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon says there's no military solution to the threat posed by North Korea and its nuclear ambitions, despite the president's recent pledge to answer further aggression with \"fire and fury.\"\n\nIn an interview with The American Prospect posted online Wednesday, Bannon tells the liberal publication that the U.S. is losing the economic race against China. He also talks about purging his rivals from the Defense and State departments.\n\nRELATED LINKSHow the term 'alt-left' came to be President Trump defended the Charlottesville marchers. Here's what we saw. Photo of 'Antifa' man assaulting officer was doctored, analysis shows\n\nBannon is also asked about the white supremacist movement, whose march on Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend led to deadly violence. He dismisses them as \"losers,\" \"a fringe element\" and \"a collection of clowns.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIt's highly unusual for Bannon, one of the most contentious members of Trump's inner circle, to give a lengthy interview to a journalist, much less one from a liberal publication.\n\nHis comments on North Korea, which contradict Trump's tough approach, could add to pressure on the president to fire him. Bannon has survived earlier rounds of having fallen out of favor with Trump, who is irked by perceptions that he was the mastermind of Trump's winning campaign and guides policy in the White House.\n\n\"There's no military solution (to North Korea's nuclear threats), forget it,\" Bannon says. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nTrump tweeted earlier Wednesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"made a very wise and well-reasoned decision\" by backing down after heightening fears of nuclear conflict in a series of combative threats, including against the U.S. territory of Guam.\n\nFiery rhetoric between North Korea and the U.S. seems to be cooling down, if temporarily. While Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Tuesday the U.S. is \"interested\" in dialogue, analysts believe Kim Jong Un's latest propaganda statement may offer a hint of de-escalation. Special correspondent Nick Schifrin reports.\n\nBannon also outlined his push for the U.S. to adopt a tougher stance on China trade, without waiting to see whether Beijing will help restrain Kim, as Trump has pressed China's leader to do. Trump also has lamented U.S. trade deficits with China.\n\n\"The economic war with China is everything,\" Bannon says. \"And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said Thursday both sides have benefited from trade.\n\nAsked about Bannon's comments, Hua said at a regular new briefing, \"There is no winner in a trade war. We hope the relevant people can refrain from dealing with a problem in the 21st century with a zero-sum mentality from the 19th or the 20th century.\"\n\nHua appealed for dialogue to \"preserve the sound and steady growth of China-U.S. relations.\"\n\nBannon was a key general election campaign adviser and has been a forceful presence in a divided White House. The former leader of conservative Breitbart News, Bannon has drawn fire from some of Trump's closest advisers, including son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nEarlier this week, the president passed up an opportunity to offer a public vote of confidence in Bannon. Trump said he's a \"good person\" and not a racist, adding that \"we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\"\n\nThe latest anti-Bannon campaign comes as Trump faces mounting criticism for insisting that white supremacist groups and those who opposed them were both at fault for deadly violence last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nIn the interview, Bannon muses about getting rid of administration officials who disagree with his strategy toward China and North Korea and replacing them with \"hawks.\"\n\n\"We gotta do this. The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy,\" Bannon says. \"Don't get me wrong. It's like, every day.\"\n\nWATCH: Report claims North Korea obtained rocket engines from a Ukrainian factory", "id": "9764519", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Steve Bannon, in rare

He pointed to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, both alumni of Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. who are pushing for a softer stance on trade with China. \"We're still fighting. There's Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.\"\n\nThe interview was conducted Tuesday by the magazine's co-editor Robert Kuttner, who said Bannon told him he reached out because he agreed with Kuttner's past writings on China. Bannon rarely speaks with reporters on the record, let alone a liberal-leaning magazine.\n\nThe interview with Bannon comes as the White House has struggled to respond to Saturday's violent racial protests in Charlottesville, Virginia and as some aides -- including Cohn -- have objected in private to Trump's restrained denunciations of white supremacists. Bannon approved of the president's approach, officials in the administration who asked not to be named have said.\n\nBannon, who also once worked at Goldman Sachs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the interview.\n\nIn the interview Bannon said his rivals in the administration are \"wetting themselves\" as he works to undermine their influence with the president and he bragged about working to get some of them ousted. There has been speculation in recent days that Bannon could be in danger of losing his job, though Trump spoke in supportive terms about about him at Tuesday's press conference.\n\nBannon said he favors pushing back against Chinese economic expansion, arguing only one country will emerge as a leader from what he described as an \"economic war.\"\n\n\"To me, the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover,\" he said.\n\nHe advocated for the U.S. to file a complaint under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act -- which allows for sanctions against countries that violate trade agreements or engage in unfair trade practices -- as well as follow-up complaints against steel and aluminum dumping, Kuttner wrote.\n\n\"We're going to run the tables on these guys. We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us,\" Bannon said.\n\nBannon also dismissed speculation that the U.S might consider using military action against North Korea to get the regime there to abandon its intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear weapon programs. Trump recently vowed to deliver \"fire and fury\" onto North Korea.\n\n\"There's no military solution, forget it,\" Bannon said. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nBannon also was dismissive in the interview of the so called far-right that he helped organize and inflame when he led Breitbart News and during Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more,\" he said. \"These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\nStill, Bannon said he's fine with the issue of race taking over the national conversation. \"The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" he is quoted as saying. \"I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"", "id": "9597434", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Bannon Says He Fights

This is also puzzling since Steve Bannon is not exactly Bambi when it comes to dealing with the press. He's probably the most media-savvy person in America,\" Kuttner writes.\n\nReport: Bannon calls white supremacists 'a collection of clowns'\n\n\"We're at economic war with China,\" Bannon told the Prospect. \"One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years, and it's gonna be them if we go down this path. On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow.\"\n\nBannon added that \"the economic war with China is everything,\" arguing the US needs to be \"maniacally focused on that.\"\n\n\"If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover,\" Bannon said.\n\nThe President's chief strategist, who has taken on an expansive portfolio from trade issues to the US's foreign wars and US manufacturing, also laid out his plans for the Trump administration to take a harder line against China on trade, explaining that the President's memorandum Monday that lays the groundwork for an investigation of Chinese trade practices is just a first step.\n\n\"We're going to run the tables on these guys,\" Bannon promised in the interview, explaining that the administration also plans to lodge trade complaints against China over steel and aluminum dumping.\n\nBut Bannon also described his work to push this hardline trade agenda as a daily struggle that pits him against other top advisers to the President, including the National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn.\n\n\"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" Bannon said. \"We're still fighting. There's Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.\"\n\nBannon also accused his rivals inside the administration who have urged restraint on trade of \"wetting themselves\" over the issue.\n\nHe went on to articulate how he is reshuffling the US's foreign policy apparatus, explaining that he is seeking the ouster of the Acting Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs at the State Department and \"getting hawks in.\"\n\nThe comments about his colleagues could place Bannon in a more precarious position inside the White House, whose staff is now being led by retired Gen.

He echoed those comments in a separate interview with the New York Times.\n\nSome analysts on the left, such as Columbia University historian Mark Lilla, agree with this argument. Even those whose philosophy is diametrically opposed to Bannon's express grudging respect for his skill as a political tactician.\n\nBannon reached out, unsolicited, to American Prospect co-founder Robert Kuttner because they share similar concerns about U.S. trade policy toward China.\n\n\"I'm slightly embarrassed that there is this point of convergence,\" Kuttner told NPR's Morning Edition on Thursday. \"His strategy -- which is grandiose and, I think, misguided -- is that he's going to build a grand, left-right coalition of people who are critical of trade policy.\"\n\nIn the American Prospect interview, Bannon described economic competition between the U.S. and China in apocalyptic terms.\n\n\"The economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that,\" Bannon said. \"If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has promised to crack down on what critics see as unfair trade practices by China. At the same time, the White House is pursuing cooperation from Beijing to put the brakes on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.\n\nEarlier this week, the president directed his trade representative to consider launching an investigation into whether China unfairly pressures U.S. companies to share their intellectual property as a condition of entering the Chinese market. The move came only after U.S. diplomats had secured China's support for a new round of sanctions against North Korea at the United Nations.\n\nBannon dismissed the North Korean threat as a \"sideshow,\" insisting the economic contest with China can't wait.\n\n\"One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path.\"\n\nBannon conceded that others within the administration have a different view.\n\n\"They're wetting themselves,\" he said of rivals at the State Department and the Pentagon, adding, \"That's a fight I fight every day here.\"\n\nBannon also acknowledged that despite the president's bellicose \"locked and loaded\" rhetoric, there is no viable military solution to North Korea's nuclear saber rattling.\n\n\"Forget it,\" he said bluntly. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 20 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters declined to elaborate on Bannon's interview.\n\n\"Steve Bannon's comments stand on their own,\" Walters told reporters. \"You are going to have to contact Steve Bannon for more.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump was asked if he still has confidence in his chief strategist and offered less than full-throated support.\n\n\"I like him. He's a good man. He is not a racist, I can tell you that,\" Trump said. \"But we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\"\n\nKuttner concludes his magazine piece by saying Bannon invited him to the White House to

(AP) -- President Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon says there's no military solution to the threat posed by North Korea and its nuclear ambitions, despite the president's recent pledge to answer further aggression with \"fire and fury.\"\n\nIn an interview with The American Prospect posted online Wednesday, Bannon tells the liberal publication that the U.S. is losing the economic race against China. He also talks about purging his rivals from the Defense and State departments.\n\nBannon is also asked about the white supremacist movement, whose march on Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend led to deadly violence. He dismisses them as \"losers,\" ''a fringe element\" and \"a collection of clowns.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"There's no military solution (to North Korea's nuclear threats), forget it,\" Bannon says. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nTrump tweeted earlier Wednesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"made a very wise and well-reasoned decision\" by backing down after heightening fears of nuclear conflict in a series of combative threats, including against the U.S. territory of Guam.\n\nKim Jong Un of North Korea made a very wise and well reasoned decision. The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 16, 2017\n\nBannon also outlined his push for the U.S. to adopt a tougher stance on China trade, without waiting to see whether Beijing will help restrain Kim, as Trump has pressed China's leader to do. Trump also has lamented U.S. trade deficits with China.\n\n\"The economic war with China is everything,\" Bannon says. \"And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nBannon was a key general election campaign adviser and has been a forceful but contentious presence in a divided White House. The former leader of conservative Breitbart News, Bannon has drawn fire from some of Trump's closest advisers, including son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nThe president is under renewed pressure to fire Bannon, who has survived earlier rounds of having fallen out of favor with Trump.\n\nEarlier this week, the president passed up an opportunity to offer a public vote of confidence in Bannon. Trump said he's a \"good person\" and not a racist, adding that \"we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\"\n\nThe latest anti-Bannon campaign comes as Trump faces mounting criticism for insisting that white supremacist groups and those who opposed them were both at fault for deadly violence last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nIn the interview, Bannon muses about getting rid of administration officials who disagree with his strategy toward China and North Korea and replacing them with \"hawks.\"\n\n\"We gotta do this. The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy,\" Bannon says. \"Don't get me wrong. It's like, every day.\"\n\nPublished: August 17, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 2:46 AM EDT Thanks for your continued support...\n\nWe recently asked you to support our journalism.

Bannon contradicted Trump, saying that \"there's no military solution\" to North Korea, despite Trump's repeated threats to attack the isolated nation.\n\nWhen the subject of the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, came up, Bannon dismissed the group as \"a collection of clowns\" and claimed that the \"media plays it up too much.\"\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element,\" Bannon said, despite having been cited as the driving force between Trump's courting of the so-called \"alt-right\" -- a collection of far-right groups, including neo-Nazis and other white supremacists. As head of Breitbart News, Bannon, who has compared Islam to Nazism, led the website to become a mouthpiece for racism and sexism and a haven for white supremacists.\n\nTrump's response to the events in Charlottesville -- in which he blamed \"many sides\" for the violence and claimed that there were some \"fine people\" among the neo-Nazis and other far-right groups -- has been resoundingly panned as sympathetic to the white supremacists. But Bannon hinted that such criticism may have been exactly what Trump was going for.\n\n\"The Democrats,\" Bannon said, \"the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nAccording to Axios, Bannon didn't know he was giving an on-the-record interview, a claim that The American Prospect seemed to dismiss.\n\n\"Steve Bannon is not exactly Bambi when it comes to dealing with the press,\" Kuttner said. \"He's probably the most media-savvy person in America.\"\n\nPressure on Trump to fire Bannon has increased in the days following the unrest in Charlottesville. Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci said earlier this week that \"this sort of 'Bannon-bart' influence\" on Trump \"is a snag on the president.\"\n\nScaramucci's comments came a day after Axios reported that Trump believes that Bannon has been leaking damaging information about his White House rivals, including National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster. The president added to the speculation by telling reporters on Tuesday that \"we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on HuffPost.", "id": "9713229", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Steve Bannon Gives Bizarre Interview Amid Departure Rumors", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cnsg_lEIWVzpKr7.eszR4w--/aD0yNTIxO3c9NDUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/the_huffington_post_584/78730cbbfb98c57e2b90a7b4615cff16", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "120", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "id": "302813", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}, "id": "303035", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}, "id": "303910", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}, "id": "304050", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "The American Prospect"}, "id": "350087", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Prospect"}, {"label": {"eng": "Identity politics"}, "id": "366725", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Kuttner"}, "id": "743029", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kuttner"}, {"label": {"eng": "Race (human categorization)"}, "id": "1083325", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alt-right"}, "id": "1268917", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right"}, {"label": {"eng": "Anthony Scaramucci"}, "id": "1280341", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Scaramucci"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 276, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations"}], "time": "14:47:00"}

The adviser reportedly has become increasingly isolated within the White House as new members join the ranks, and The New York Times reported this week that Bannon had not personally met with President Trump for over a week.\n\nThe same report said the president did speak with Bannon over the weekend as he tried to form a response to the violence that took place at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va.", "id": "9681365", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Bannon calls far right 'clowns,' says enemies are 'wetting themselves,' in rare interview", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/08/16/0/0/694940094001_5543225918001_5543217420001-vs.jpg?ve=1", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "120", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "65774", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "235649", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fox News Channel"}, "id": "302938", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Channel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}, "id": "302944", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}, "id": "303035", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}, "id": "303042", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}, "id": "303910", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}, "id": "303936", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chairman"}, "id": "305842", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}, "id": "306725", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean"}, {"label": {"eng": "The New Yorker"}, "id": "324492", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "348464", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia", "label": {"eng": "East Asia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "The American Prospect"}, "id": "350087", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Prospect"}, {"label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}, "id": "352527", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Kuttner"}, "id": "743029", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kuttner"}, {"label": {"eng": "Anthony Scaramucci"}, "id": "1280341", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Scaramucci"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 405, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 979, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Performers", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Performers"}], "time": "12:05:00"}

Bannon contradicted Trump, saying that \"there's no military solution\" to North Korea, despite Trump's repeated threats to attack the isolated nation.\n\nWhen the subject of the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, came up, Bannon dismissed the group as \"a collection of clowns\" and claimed that the \"media plays it up too much.\"\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element,\" Bannon said, despite having been cited as the driving force between Trump's courting of the so-called \"alt-right\" -- a collection of far-right groups, including neo-Nazis and other white supremacists. As head of Breitbart News, Bannon, who has compared Islam to Nazism, led the website to become a mouthpiece for racism and sexism and a haven for white supremacists.\n\nTrump's response to the events in Charlottesville -- in which he blamed \"many sides\" for the violence and claimed that there were some \"fine people\" among the neo-Nazis and other far-right groups -- has been resoundingly panned as sympathetic to the white supremacists. But Bannon hinted that such criticism may have been exactly what Trump was going for.\n\n\"The Democrats,\" Bannon said, \"the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nAccording to Axios, Bannon didn't know he was giving an on-the-record interview, a claim that The American Prospect seemed to dismiss.\n\n\"Steve Bannon is not exactly Bambi when it comes to dealing with the press,\" Kuttner said. \"He's probably the most media-savvy person in America.\"\n\nPressure on Trump to fire Bannon has increased in the days following the unrest in Charlottesville. Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci said earlier this week that \"this sort of 'Bannon-bart' influence\" on Trump \"is a snag on the president.\"\n\nScaramucci's comments came a day after Axios reported that Trump believes that Bannon has been leaking damaging information about his White House rivals, including National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster. The president added to the speculation by telling reporters on Tuesday that \"we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\"", "id": "9669586", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Steve Bannon Gives Bizarre Interview Amid Departure Rumors", "image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5995687114000020002c333c.jpeg?cache=hhwf1hz0am&ops=1910_1000", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "120", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "id": "302813", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}, "id": "303035", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}, "id": "303910", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}, "id": "304050", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "The American Prospect"}, "id": "350087", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Prospect"}, {"label": {"eng": "Identity politics"}, "id": "366725", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Kuttner"}, "id": "743029", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kuttner"}, {"label": {"eng": "Race (human categorization)"}, "id": "1083325", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alt-right"}, "id": "1268917", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right"}, {"label": {"eng": "Anthony Scaramucci"}, "id": "1280341", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Scaramucci"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations"}], "time": "11:01:00"}

But the former leader of the conservative Breitbart News has drawn fire from some of Trump's closest advisers, including son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nThe latest anti-Bannon campaign comes as Trump finds himself increasingly isolated, except among his core supporters, for insisting that white supremacist groups and those who opposed them were both at fault in Charlottesville.\n\nOthers believe Bannon is behind a campaign conservative groups and the Breitbart website are waging against national security adviser H.R. McMaster, arguing he is insufficiently supportive of Israel and soft on Iran. Trump recently issued a rare public statement of support for McMaster.\n\nBannon's comments on North Korea, which contradict Trump's tough approach, could add to pressure on the president to fire him. Bannon has survived earlier rounds of having fallen out of favor with Trump, who is irked by perceptions that Bannon was the mastermind of Trump's winning campaign and that he guides policy in the White House.\n\n\"There's no military solution (to North Korea's nuclear threats), forget it,\" Bannon says. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nTrump tweeted early Wednesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"made a very wise and well-reasoned decision\" by backing down after heightening fears of nuclear conflict in a series of combative threats, including against the U.S. territory of Guam.\n\nBannon also outlined his push for the U.S. to adopt a tougher stance on China trade -- without waiting to see whether Beijing will help restrain Kim as Trump has pressed China's leader to do. Trump also has lamented U.S. trade deficits with China.\n\n\"The economic war with China is everything,\" Bannon says. \"And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said Thursday that both sides have benefited from trade.\n\nAsked at a regular news briefing about Bannon's comments, Hua said \"there is no winner in a trade war. We hope the relevant people can refrain from dealing with a problem in the 21st century with a zero-sum mentality from the 19th or the 20th century.\"\n\nHua appealed for dialogue to \"preserve the sound and steady growth of China-U.S. relations.\"\n\nIn the interview, Bannon muses about getting rid of administration officials who disagree with his stance on China and North Korea and replacing them with \"hawks.\"\n\n\"We gotta do this. The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy,\" Bannon says. \"Don't get me wrong. It's like, every day.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap", "id": "9705713", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "By Darlene Superville /

He echoed those comments in a separate interview with The New York Times.\n\nSome analysts on the left, such as Columbia University historian Mark Lilla, agree with this argument. Even those whose philosophy is diametrically opposed to Bannon's have expressed grudging respect for his skill as a political tactician.\n\nBannon reached out, unsolicited, to American Prospect co-founder Robert Kuttner because they share similar concerns about U.S. trade policy toward China.\n\n\"I'm slightly embarrassed that there is this point of convergence,\" Kuttner told NPR's Morning Edition on Thursday. \"His strategy -- which is grandiose and, I think, misguided -- is that he's going to build a grand, left-right coalition of people who are critical of trade policy.\"\n\nIn the American Prospect interview, Bannon described economic competition between the U.S. and China in apocalyptic terms.\n\n\"The economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that,\" Bannon said. \"If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has promised to crack down on what critics see as unfair trade practices by China. At the same time, the White House is pursuing cooperation from Beijing to put the brakes on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.\n\nEarlier this week, the president directed his trade representative to consider launching an investigation into whether China unfairly pressures U.S. companies to share their intellectual property as a condition of entering the Chinese market. The move came after U.S. diplomats had secured China's support for a new round of sanctions against North Korea at the United Nations.\n\nBannon dismissed the North Korean threat as a \"sideshow,\" insisting the economic contest with China can't wait.\n\n\"One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years, and it's gonna be them if we go down this path.\"\n\nBannon conceded that others within the administration have a different view.\n\n\"They're wetting themselves,\" he said of rivals at the State Department and the Pentagon, adding, \"That's a fight I fight every day here.\"\n\nBannon also acknowledged that despite the president's bellicose \"locked and loaded\" rhetoric, there is no viable military solution to North Korea's nuclear saber rattling.\n\n\"Forget it,\" he said bluntly. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 20 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters declined to elaborate on Bannon's interview.\n\n\"Steve Bannon's comments stand on their own,\" Walters told reporters. \"You are going to have to contact Steve Bannon for more.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump was asked whether he still has confidence in his chief strategist and offered less than full-throated support.\n\n\"I like him. He's a good man. He is not a racist, I can tell you that,\" Trump said. \"But we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\"\n\nKuttner concludes his magazine piece by saying Bannon invited him to the White House to

In the aftermath of events in Charlottesville, he is widely blamed for his boss's continuing indulgence of white supremacists. Allies of National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster hold Bannon responsible for a campaign by Breitbart News, which Bannon once led, to vilify the security chief. Trump's defense of Bannon, at his Tuesday press conference, was tepid.\n\nBut Bannon was in high spirits when he phoned me Tuesday afternoon to discuss the politics of taking a harder line with China, and minced no words describing his efforts to neutralize his rivals at the Departments of Defense, State, and Treasury. \"They're wetting themselves,\" he said, proceeding to detail how he would oust some of his opponents at State and Defense.\n\nNeedless to say, I was a little stunned to get an email from Bannon's assistant midday Tuesday, just as all hell was breaking loose once again about Charlottesville, saying that Bannon wished to meet with me. I'd just published a column on how China was profiting from the U.S.-North Korea nuclear brinkmanship, and it included some choice words about Bannon's boss.\n\n\"In Kim, Trump has met his match,\" I wrote. \"The risk of two arrogant fools blundering into a nuclear exchange is more serious than at any time since October 1962.\" Maybe Bannon wanted to scream at me?\n\nI told the assistant that I was on vacation, but I would be happy to speak by phone. Bannon promptly called.\n\nFar from dressing me down for comparing Trump to Kim, he began, \"It's a great honor to finally track you down. I've followed your writing for years and I think you and I are in same boat when it comes to China. You absolutely nailed it.\"\n\n\"We're at economic war with China,\" he added. \"It's in all their literature. They're not shy about saying what they're doing. One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path. On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow.\"\n\nBannon said he might consider a deal in which China got North Korea to freeze its nuclear buildup with verifiable inspections and the United States removed its troops from the peninsula, but such a deal seemed remote. Given that China is not likely to do much more on North Korea, and that the logic of mutually assured destruction was its own source of restraint, Bannon saw no reason not to proceed with tough trade sanctions against China.\n\nContrary to Trump's threat of fire and fury, Bannon said: \"There's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats], forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\" Bannon went on to describe his battle inside the administration to take a harder line on China trade, and not to fall into a trap of wishful thinking in which complaints against China's trade practices now had to take a backseat to the hope that China, as honest broker, would help restrain Kim.\n\n\"To me,\" Bannon said, \"the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nBannon's plan of attack includes: a complaint under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act against Chinese coercion of technology transfers from American corporations doing business there, and follow-up complaints against steel and aluminum dumping. \"We're going to run the tables on these guys. We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us.\"\n\nBut what about his internal adversaries, at the departments of State and Defense, who think the United States can enlist Beijing's aid on the North Korean standoff, and at Treasury and the National Economic Council who don't want to mess with the trading system?\n\n\"Oh, they're wetting themselves,\" he said, explaining that the Section 301 complaint, which was put on hold when the war of threats with North Korea broke out, was shelved only temporarily, and will be revived in three weeks. As for other cabinet departments, Bannon has big plans to marginalize their influence.\n\n\"I'm changing out people at East Asian Defense; I'm getting hawks in. I'm getting Susan Thornton [acting head of East Asian and Pacific Affairs] out at State.\"\n\nBut can Bannon really win that fight internally?\n\n\"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" he said. \"We're still fighting. There's Treasury and [National Economic Council chair] Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.\"\n\n\"We gotta do this. The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy. Don't get me wrong. It's like, every day.\"\n\nBannon explained that his strategy is to battle the trade doves inside the administration while building an outside coalition of trade hawks that includes left as well as right. Hence the phone call to me.\n\nThere are a couple of things that are startling about this premise. First, to the extent that most of the opponents of Bannon's China trade strategy are other Trump administration officials, it's not clear how reaching out to the left helps him. If anything, it gives his adversaries ammunition to characterize Bannon as unreliable or disloyal.\n\nMore puzzling is the fact that Bannon would phone a writer and editor of a progressive publication (the cover lines on whose first two issues after Trump's election were \"Resisting Trump\" and \"Containing Trump\") and assume that a possible convergence of views on China trade might somehow paper over the political and moral chasm on white nationalism.\n\nThe question of whether the phone call was on or off the record never came up. This is also puzzling, since Steve Bannon is not exactly Bambi when it comes to dealing with the press. He's probably the most media-savvy person in America.\n\nI asked Bannon about the connection between his program of economic nationalism and the ugly white nationalism epitomized by the racist violence in Charlottesville and Trump's reluctance to condemn it. Bannon, after all, was the architect of the strategy of using Breitbart to heat up white nationalism and then rely on the radical right as Trump's base.\n\nHe dismissed the far right as irrelevant and sidestepped his own role in cultivating it: \"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more.\"\n\n\"The Democrats,\" he said, \"the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nI had never before spoken with Bannon. I came away from the conversation with a sense both of his savvy and his recklessness. The waters around him are rising, but he is going about his business of infighting, and attempting to cultivate improbable outside allies, to promote his China strategy. His enemies will do what they do.\n\nEither the reports of the threats to Bannon's job are grossly exaggerated and leaked by his rivals, or he has decided not to change his routine and to go down fighting. Given Trump's impulsivity, neither Bannon nor Trump really has any idea from day to day whether Bannon is staying or going. He has survived earlier threats. So what the hell, damn the torpedoes.\n\nThe conversation ended with Bannon inviting me to the White House after Labor Day to continue the discussion of China and trade.

He echoed those comments in a separate interview with the New York Times.\n\nSome analysts on the left, such as Columbia University historian Mark Lilla, agree with this argument. Even those whose philosophy is diametrically opposed to Bannon's express grudging respect for his skill as a political tactician.\n\nBannon reached out, unsolicited, to American Prospect co-founder Robert Kuttner because they share similar concerns about U.S. trade policy toward China.\n\n\"I'm slightly embarrassed that there is this point of convergence,\" Kuttner told NPR's Morning Edition on Thursday. \"His strategy -- which is grandiose and, I think, misguided -- is that he's going to build a grand, left-right coalition of people who are critical of trade policy.\"\n\nIn the American Prospect interview, Bannon described economic competition between the U.S. and China in apocalyptic terms.\n\n\"The economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that,\" Bannon said. \"If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has promised to crack down on what critics see as unfair trade practices by China. At the same time, the White House is pursuing cooperation from Beijing to put the brakes on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.\n\nEarlier this week, the president directed his trade representative to consider launching an investigation into whether China unfairly pressures U.S. companies to share their intellectual property as a condition of entering the Chinese market. The move came only after U.S. diplomats had secured China's support for a new round of sanctions against North Korea at the United Nations.\n\nBannon dismissed the North Korean threat as a \"sideshow,\" insisting the economic contest with China can't wait.\n\n\"One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path.\"\n\nBannon conceded that others within the administration have a different view.\n\n\"They're wetting themselves,\" he said of rivals at the State Department and the Pentagon, adding, \"That's a fight I fight every day here.\"\n\nBannon also acknowledged that despite the president's bellicose \"locked and loaded\" rhetoric, there is no viable military solution to North Korea's nuclear saber rattling.\n\n\"Forget it,\" he said bluntly. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 20 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters declined to elaborate on Bannon's interview.\n\n\"Steve Bannon's comments stand on their own,\" Walters told reporters. \"You are going to have to contact Steve Bannon for more.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump was asked if he still has confidence in his chief strategist and offered less than full-throated support.\n\n\"I like him. He's a good man. He is not a racist, I can tell you that,\" Trump said. \"But we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\"\n\nKuttner concludes his magazine piece by saying Bannon invited him to the White House to

(OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWhite House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon gave a surprise interview on Tuesday, condemning white supremacists and expressing his concerns about the United States' \"economic war\" with China.\n\nBannon called the co-founder and co-editor of The American Prospect, a left-wing magazine that aims to \"advance liberal and progressive goals,\" seemingly out of the blue.\n\nBut Bannon wasn't calling to lambast the editor, Robert Kuttner, over recent articles criticizing Trump, but to praise him for his take on China and to give a wide-ranging interview on his view of things in the White House and beyond.\n\nKuttner said Bannon was in \"high spirits\" when he called and praised Kuttner's recent reporting on China. He also said that he was stunned that Bannon approached him.\n\n\"We're at economic war with China,\" Bannon said in the interview. \"It's in all their literature. They're not shy about saying what they're doing. One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path. On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow.\"\n\nBannon told Kuttner he would consider a deal with China that would see the United States remove troops from the Korean peninsula in exchange for North Korea freezing its nuclear buildup with verifiable inspections, but such a deal seemed unlikely.\n\nThere was no easy solution to North Korea, said Bannon, and even a military strike could result in huge South Korean casualties.\n\nBannon expressed worry that the \"sideshow\" problem of North Korea was distracting the United States from a more serious threat.\n\n\"To me,\" Bannon said, \"the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nBannon wants to see the United States begin to use the legal provisions it has that have never been fully deployed, including filing a complaint under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act to take action against the Chinese regime's practice of forcing American corporations to transfer technology to Chinese partners in exchange for market access there.\n\n\"We're going to run the tables on these guys. We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us.\"\n\nBannon also spoke of his rivals in the White House and \"economic doves\" who have made it difficult to pursue the trade policy he advocates for.\n\nAs for talk of the far-right, Bannon was dismissive and derided extremist groups.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers.

Bannon even suggested he was working on removing one of them.\n\nBannon's critics, eager to see his blood in the political water, pounced.\n\nBannon gave an \"accidental interview,\" they said, just like Anthony Scaramucci, the disgraced former communications director at the White House. Bannon also undermined President Donald Trump on North Korea policy, the pundits cried.\n\nBut in reality, the accidental interview -- if it was indeed that, and not a Bannon scheme to turn the national debate away from Confederate monuments back to issues -- showed Bannon was happy with where the Trump agenda was going, and that he stood behind it.\n\nBannon even mocked both Trump's trade critics -- he said they were \"wetting\" themselves -- and called white supremacists \"clowns.\"\n\nMost tellingly, Bannon stressed he is happy with the increasingly tough stance Trump has taken in regard to China on trade. He promised a skeptical eye would remain focused on China and its economic practices.\n\n\"We're at economic war with China,\" Bannon told Robert Kuttner, a left-wing journalist who specializes in liberal trade policy. \"It's in all their literature. They're not shy about saying what they're doing. One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path. On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow.\"\n\n\"To me, the economic war with China is everything and we have to be maniacally focused on that.\"\n\nBannon said the Trump White House must be laser-focused on China and the trade imbalance.\n\n\"To me, the economic war with China is everything,\" said Bannon. \"And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nBannon has only two potential problems. One was his admission -- surprisingly candid -- that there is no military solution to the North Korean problem. But that's because South Korea's capital is perilously close to major North Korean artillery and most military experts agree there is no scenario in which war does not result in massive casualties.\n\n\"There's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats], forget it,\" Bannon told Kuttner. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nBannon also bashed those he believes are out to undermine the true Trump agenda in the White House. As chief strategist for Trump, he said he's working on moving or sidelining his foes such as Gary Cohn, the president's economic adviser and chair of the National Economic Council.\n\n\"Oh, they're wetting themselves,\" Bannon said of tactics used to strong-arm internal foes. \"I'm changing out people at East Asian Defense. I'm getting hawks in. I'm getting Susan Thornton [acting head of East Asian and Pacific Affairs] out at State.\"\n\nBannon told Kuttner he is battling Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive, and other monied big shots -- every day.\n\n\"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" he said. \"We're still fighting. There's Treasury and [National Economic Council chair] Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying. We gotta do this. The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy. Don't get me wrong.

The call between Bannon and American Prospect writer Robert Kuttner covered a range of topics, including North Korea, Bannon's feuds within the Trump administration, and the fallout from a deadly Charlottesville protest.Bannon has faced renewed calls for his firing this week.\n\nSteve Bannon shared some candid thoughts on a wide range of subjects in an interview with the progressive-leaning magazine, The American Prospect, published on Wednesday.\n\nThe interviews reveal Bannon's thoughts on President Donald Trump's US-China trade policy, his own views about the president's rancorous feud last week with the leader of North Korea, the deadly Charlottesville rally, white nationalist groups, and his ongoing feuds inside the Trump administration.\n\nThe White House chief strategist also pitched what American Prospect writer Robert Kuttner described as a plan to \"marginalize\" his adversaries in the Trump administration.\n\nBannon talked of Trump's plans to sign a measure that would open an investigation into intellectual property violations against American companies by Chinese firms. The law under which that measure was drafted, Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, would allow Trump to place a tariff on another country without Congressional approval.\n\nThe plans to reshape US-China trade policies do not end there, Bannon indicated. He talked of shifting people within the Trump administration to achieve expansive goals on that front.\n\n\"I'm changing out people at East Asian Defense; I'm getting hawks in,\" Bannon said. \"I'm getting Susan Thornton [acting head of East Asian and Pacific Affairs] out at State.\"\n\nBannon continued: \"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" he said. \"We're still fighting.\"\n\nKuttner openly questioned why Bannon, a former executive of the far-right news outlet Breitbart, called him -- a reporter for a progressive-leaning publication -- to sound off about some of his biggest plans for the White House's economic agenda.\n\nHere's Kuttner:\n\n\"Bannon explained that his strategy is to battle the trade doves inside the administration while building an outside coalition of trade hawks that includes left as well as right. Hence the phone call to me.\"\n\nBannon said later that he was unaware the conversation was on-the-record.\n\n(Steve Bannon.Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nWorking amid calls for his firing\n\nBannon's comments came after days of scorching fallout from Trump's response to a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The president has been dragged by Republican and Democratic leaders, and abandoned by CEOs of some of the biggest American corporations after Trump wavered in his denunciations of some hate groups involved in the violence.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element,\" Bannon said, apparently referring to demonstrators without describing any specific ethnicity, adding that \"the media plays it up too much.\"\n\n\"These guys are a collection of clowns,\" Bannon said.\n\nSome critics have pointed to Bannon, who they accused of influencing Trump's reactions to the violence in Virginia. Although Bannon spoke with Trump several times last weekend, according to the news website Axios, he \"has not meaningfully advised\" Trump on his response to Charlottesville, the publication said.\n\nBannon's immediate future in the White House has also been called into question in the aftermath of Charlottesville, with several lawmakers urging Trump to fire him. Trump said during a fiery news conference on Tuesday: \"We'll see about Mr. Bannon.\"\n\nNOW WATCH: The White House is undergoing renovations -- here's how it changed after a massive facelift in the

But the former leader of the conservative Breitbart News has drawn fire from some of Trump's closest advisers, including son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nThe latest anti-Bannon campaign comes as Trump finds himself increasingly isolated, except among his core supporters, for insisting that white supremacist groups and those who opposed them were both at fault in Charlottesville.\n\nOthers believe Bannon is behind a campaign conservative groups and the Breitbart website are waging against national security adviser H.R. McMaster, arguing he is insufficiently supportive of Israel and soft on Iran. Trump recently issued a rare public statement of support for McMaster.\n\nBannon's comments on North Korea, which contradict Trump's tough approach, could add to pressure on the president to fire him. Bannon has survived earlier rounds of having fallen out of favor with Trump, who is irked by perceptions that Bannon was the mastermind of Trump's winning campaign and that he guides policy in the White House.\n\n\"There's no military solution (to North Korea's nuclear threats), forget it,\" Bannon says. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nTrump tweeted early Wednesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"made a very wise and well-reasoned decision\" by backing down after heightening fears of nuclear conflict in a series of combative threats, including against the U.S. territory of Guam.\n\nBannon also outlined his push for the U.S. to adopt a tougher stance on China trade -- without waiting to see whether Beijing will help restrain Kim as Trump has pressed China's leader to do. Trump also has lamented U.S. trade deficits with China.\n\n\"The economic war with China is everything,\" Bannon says. \"And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said Thursday that both sides have benefited from trade.\n\nAsked at a regular news briefing about Bannon's comments, Hua said \"there is no winner in a trade war. We hope the relevant people can refrain from dealing with a problem in the 21st century with a zero-sum mentality from the 19th or the 20th century.\"\n\nHua appealed for dialogue to \"preserve the sound and steady growth of China-U.S. relations.\"\n\nIn the interview, Bannon muses about getting rid of administration officials who disagree with his stance on China and North Korea and replacing them with \"hawks.\"\n\n\"We gotta do this. The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy,\" Bannon says.\n\nOne official Bannon mentioned by name is Susan Thornton, currently America's top diplomat for Asia.\n\nOn Thursday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson signaled support for his senior adviser. After greeting Japan's defense chief and top diplomat at the State Department, Tillerson pointedly shook Thornton's hand in front of the cameras as their meeting began.\n\n-- -- --\n\nAssociated Press

Bannon was apparently surprised when Kuttner turned his incredibly newsworthy comments into a story.\n\nIf that sounds familiar, it's because short-lived White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci did exactly the same thing a few weeks ago after calling a writer at The New Yorker. In his call Scaramucci, who was fired soon after the episode, accused Bannon of leaking stories to reporters and suggested the two were different because \"I'm not Steve Bannon, I'm not trying to suck my own c***\".\n\nScaramucci has continued to give interviews since his firing and suggested a few days ago that Bannon should be fired. He's seemingly far from the only one who holds that view, with the former Breitbart editor facing increasing pressure from internal rivals and outside critics in the wake of the President's response to the white nationalist violence in Charlottesville.\n\nAt his now-infamous press conference on Monday, Trump offered a novel defence of the man who helped guide his campaign to the White House.\n\n\"He is not a racist\", said Trump.\n\n\"We'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon, but he's a good person and I think the press treats him, frankly, very unfairly\".\n\nHow Trump responds to Bannon's 'accidental' interview could decide the fate of America's most prominent white nationalist.\n\nHow the White House chief strategist got himself in trouble\n\nBannon on North Korea:\n\n\"There's no military solution, forget it\", Bannon said. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us\".\n\nBannon on China:\n\n\"We're at economic war with China...On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow. To me the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover\".\n\nBannon on white nationalists (while head of Breitbart, he proudly declared the site \"the platform for the alt-right\"):\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more ... These guys are a collection of clowns\".\n\nBannon on the left:\n\n\"The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats\".\n\nBannon on internal fights over national security policy:\n\n\"I'm getting hawks in...We gotta do this. The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy. Don't get me wrong.

If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nBannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart News who once called the site a \"platform for the alt-right,\" helped Trump form the nationalist message that cemented his base of support during the 2016 campaign.\n\nBut Bannon dismissed the white supremacists who demonstrated in Charlottesville as a \"bunch of clowns.\"\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers,\" Bannon told Kuttner. \"It's a fringe element, I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it.\"\n\nAnd Bannon did not seem concerned that Trump appeared to distance himself from him Tuesday. Rather, he said his rivals within the State and Defense departments are \"wetting themselves.\"\n\nBannon believes the U.S. is \"at economic war with China\" and many of those he views as adversaries wish to work with Beijing on trade and North Korea. He even called out some of those he wishes to see gone by name.\n\n\"I'm changing out people at East Asian Defense,\" Bannon said. \"I'm getting hawks in. I'm getting Susan Thornton out at State.\" Thorton is currently the acting head of East Asian and Pacific Affairs.\n\nBannon said he also is fighting Trump's national economic chair Gary Cohn and \"Goldman Sachs lobbying.\"\n\nBannon's strategy, according to Kuttner, \"is to battle the trade doves inside the administration while building an outside coalition of trade hawks that includes the left as well as right.\"\n\nKuttner believes Bannon reached out to him as part of this strategy. It was an effort to gain an ally from the left who shares some of his positions on China trade policy.\n\nKuttner said he found it \"puzzling\" that Bannon would \"assume that a possible convergence of views on China trade might somehow paper over the political and moral chasm on white nationalism.\"\n\n\"Either the reports of the threats to Bannon's job are grossly exaggerated and leaked by his rivals, or he has decided not to change his routine and to go down fighting,\" Kuttner concluded.\n\nAs for North Korea, Bannon appeared to be at odds with Trump that there's a military solution to the crisis.\n\n\"There's no military solution (to North Korea's nuclear threats), forget it,\" Bannon dais. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "id":

This is also puzzling since Steve Bannon is not exactly Bambi when it comes to dealing with the press. He's probably the most media-savvy person in America,\" Kuttner writes.\n\n\"We're at economic war with China,\" Bannon told the Prospect. \"One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years, and it's gonna be them if we go down this path. On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow.\"\n\nBannon added that \"the economic war with China is everything,\" arguing the US needs to be \"maniacally focused on that.\"\n\n\"If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover,\" Bannon said.\n\nThe President's chief strategist, who has taken on an expansive portfolio from trade issues to the US's foreign wars and US manufacturing, also laid out his plans for the Trump administration to take a harder line against China on trade, explaining that the President's memorandum Monday that lays the groundwork for an investigation of Chinese trade practices is just a first step.\n\n\"We're going to run the tables on these guys,\" Bannon promised in the interview, explaining that the administration also plans to lodge trade complaints against China over steel and aluminum dumping.\n\nBut Bannon also described his work to push this hardline trade agenda as a daily struggle that pits him against other top advisers to the President, including the National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn.\n\n\"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" Bannon said. \"We're still fighting. There's Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.\"\n\nBannon also accused his rivals inside the administration who have urged restraint on trade of \"wetting themselves\" over the issue.\n\nHe went on to articulate how he is reshuffling the US's foreign policy apparatus, explaining that he is seeking the ouster of the Acting Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs at the State Department and \"getting hawks in.\"\n\nThe comments about his colleagues could place Bannon in a more precarious position inside the White House, whose staff is now being led by retired Gen.

Kuttner wrote that he never requested the interview and was \"stunned\" to hear from Bannon. It has since been reported that Bannon was unaware he was providing an interview.\n\nThe former Breitbart editor also spoke about the threat posed by North Korea following Trump's tit for tat with Kim Jung Un over Guam last week, saying that there is no military solution to the conflict.\n\nThe American Prospect article reads:\n\nBut Bannon was in high spirits when he phoned me Tuesday afternoon to discuss the politics of taking a harder line with China, and minced no words describing his efforts to neutralize his rivals at the Departments of Defense, State, and Treasury.\n\n\"They're wetting themselves,\" he said, proceeding to detail how he would oust some of his opponents at State and Defense.\n\nNeedless to say, I was a little stunned to get an email from Bannon's assistant midday Tuesday, just as all hell was breaking loose once again about Charlottesville, saying that Bannon wished to meet with me.\n\nI'd just published a column on how China was profiting from the U.S.-North Korea nuclear brinkmanship, and it included some choice words about Bannon's boss.\n\n\"There's no military solution (to North Korea's nuclear threats), forget it,\" Bannon told The American Prospect.\n\n\"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nTrump tweeted earlier Wednesday that Kim \"made a very wise and well-reasoned decision\" by backing down after heightening fears of nuclear conflict in a series of combative threats, including against the US territory.\n\nBannon's comments come amid increasing calls from both sides of the political spectrum for him to lose his job, and when asked about his strategist's future at a press conference this week, Trump simply said: \"We'll see what happens\".\n\nWhile not declaring his support for Bannon, Trump did add that he was a \"good person\", however, he also declared that there was some \"very fine people\" on both sides at the Charlottesville protests.\n\nThe White House has not responded to Bannon's latest comments, the Associated Press reported, but it has left many commentators aghast.\n\nSteve Bannon's colleagues can't believe what they're reading tonight -- and here's the twist: neither can Bannon. https://t.co/SRyxJDv5Bc -- Jonathan Swan (@jonathanvswan)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nIF you're trying to get to the eyepopping Bannon interview with the American Prospect, here's the cached page: https://t.co/vJilHibrsK -- Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nThis is Steve Bannon's strategy in a nutshell.

Trump also has lamented US trade deficits with China.\n\n\"The economic war with China is everything,\" Bannon said. \"And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nIn the interview, Bannon muses about getting rid of administration officials who disagree with his strategy toward China and North Korea and replacing them with \"hawks\".\n\n\"We gotta do this.

Bannon, the White House chief strategist, seemed to take issue with President Donald Trump on North Korea, attacked white supremacists as \"clowns\" and \"losers\" and described his efforts against administration rivals in an unusual interview Wednesday with The American Prospect, a progressive magazine.\n\nThe interview with magazine co-editor and columnist Robert Kuttner was initiated by Bannon, Kuttner said, in an Anthony Scaramucci-style phone call out of the blue in response to a column Kuttner had written on China.\n\n\"Bannon was in high spirits when he phoned me Tuesday afternoon to discuss the politics of taking a harder line with China, and minced no words describing his efforts to neutralize rivals at the Departments of Defense, State and Treasury,\" wrote Kuttner.\n\n\"'They're wetting themselves,' he said, proceeding to detail how he would oust some of his opponents at State and Defense.\"\n\nOn North Korea, Bannon said: \"'Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.'\"\n\nThat comment seemed at odds with Trump's \"fire and fury\" threats to use military force against North Korea.\n\nOn China, Bannon told Kuttner that the United States was at \"economic war\" and warned that \"one of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path,\" according to the article.\n\n\"On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow,\" he said.\n\nBannon was also asked by Kuttner to comment on the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville last weekend and President' Trump's reluctance to condemn the participants.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism - it's losers. It's a fringe element,\" Bannon told the magazine. \"I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, eh, help crush it more.\"\n\n\"These guys are a collection of clowns,\" he added.\n\nThe remarks were startling coming from Bannon, who spent more than four years running the far-right website Breitbart News before he was tapped to join Trump's campaign.\n\nBannon, the site's former executive chair, has called the Breitbart \"a platform of the alt-right,\" referring to the small, deeply conservative movement that seeks a whites-only state. It was his strategy to use the site to channel white supremacist support for Trump and provide a mouthpiece for his populist message during the 2016 election, a move that helped secure him a senior role in the administration.\n\nIn the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, which left a counterprotester dead and others injured, civil rights leaders have called on Trump to fire Bannon over his ties to the white nationalist community, as The Washington Post has reported.\n\nAsked by reporters Tuesday if he still had confidence in his chief strategist, Trump deflected.\n\n\"He's not a racist, I can tell you that,\" Trump said. \"But we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\"\n\nKuttner wrote in Wednesday's article that he was surprised when he got an email from one of Bannon's assistants saying he wanted to arrange a meeting. The two ended up speaking by phone on Tuesday afternoon, according to the article.\n\nWhen the conversation turned to race and the events in Charlottesville, Bannon dodged questions about his role in cultivating the alt-right, according to the article. He also faulted Democrats for focusing on identity politics.\n\n\"The longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" he said. \"I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nKuttner said he was puzzled by the fact that Bannon would call an editor at a progressive magazine and \"assume that a possible convergence of views on China trade might somehow paper over the political and moral chasm on white nationalism.\"\n\n\"The question of whether the phone call was on or off the record never came up,\" he said. \"This is also puzzling, since Stephen K. Bannon is not exactly Bambi when it comes to dealing with the press. He's probably the most media-savvy person in America.\"", "id": "9697038", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Steve Bannon says rivals 'wetting themselves,' calls supremacists 'clowns,'

His comments emerged alongside another report that says Trump is afraid of firing him.\n\n\"These guys are a collection of clowns,\" Bannon said of hard-right groups that marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, which left dozens injured and a 32-year-old woman who was protesting the march dead.\n\nDaily Emails and Alerts - Get the best of Newsweek delivered to your inbox\n\nWhite House chief strategist Steve Bannon called white nationalists \"losers\" in an interview with a progressive magazine Wednesday. Carlos Barria/Reuters\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it -- you know, help crush it more,\" Bannon said. His comments are at odds with his role leading Breitbart, a hard-right online news outlet, which he called \"the platform for the alt-right\" during the 2016 campaign.\n\nIn a press conference at Manhattan's Trump Tower Tuesday, the president defended the alt-right, a loose-knit group of white supremacists, white nationalists, conspiracy theorists and populists, which has become increasingly visible since his election victory.\n\nBut the president also said \"we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon\" when asked about the White House aide's status within the administration following bipartisan calls for him to be fired for his past support for the alt-right.\n\n\"The president obviously is very nervous and afraid of firing him,\" a source close to the White House told Reuters Wednesday. The source said the concern is that Bannon could turn into a harsh critic of the administration if he's forced out.\n\nRelated: Trump is scared of Steve Bannon and that's why he hasn't been fired: Report\n\nNational Security Adviser H.R. McMaster has recently blamed Bannon for a sustained campaign of stories on Breitbart attacking his character after he worked to fire Bannon's allies on the National Security Council.\n\nIn the interview, Bannon also contradicted Trump's threats of military action against North Korea over its continuing intercontinental ballistic missile tests and development of nuclear weapons.\n\n\"There's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats]. Forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about. There's no military solution here. They got us.\"\n\nIn the interview, Bannon had his sights set on a larger issue. \"We're at economic war with China,\" he said. \"We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us.\"\n\nBannon said that to him \"the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nHe said he plans to challenge China and its trade imbalance by lodging complaints against its steel and aluminum export practices and use the 1974 Trade Act to block China's practice of extracting technology from American companies.\n\nThese strategies, he said, are riling his opponents in the State, Defense and Treasury departments and the National Economic Council. But he has plans to marginalize Trump administration members.\n\n\"I'm changing out people at East Asian Defense; I'm getting hawks in. I'm getting Susan Thornton [acting head of the East Asian and Pacific Affairs Bureau] out at State,\" Bannon said.\n\nHis comment about Thornton shows Bannon believes he has strong influence over Tillerson, who has tried to make Thornton permanent in the role but has been blocked by the White House.\n\n\"They're wetting themselves,\" Bannon said of his government rivals and opponents on tougher trade policies against China. \"The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy.\"", "id": "9738490", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Steve Bannon

He also talked about purging his rivals from the Defence and State departments.\n\nIt has been reported Mr Bannon was not aware it was an official interview.\n\nMr Bannon was also asked about the white supremacist movement, whose march on Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend led to deadly violence.

Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMr Trump tweeted earlier on Wednesday North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"made a very wise and well-reasoned decision\" by backing down after heightening fears of nuclear conflict in a series of combative threats, including against the US territory of Guam.\n\n\"There's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats], forget it,\" Mr Bannon told The American Prospect.\n\n\"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here.

Mr Trump said he was a \"good person\" and not a racist, adding, \"we'll see what happens with Mr Bannon\".\n\nThe latest anti-Bannon campaign comes as Mr Trump faces mounting criticism for insisting white supremacist groups and those who opposed them were both at fault for the deadly violence in Charlottesville.\n\nIn the interview, Mr Bannon also mused about getting rid of administration officials who disagree with his strategy toward China and North Korea and replacing them with \"hawks\".\n\n\"We gotta do this.

This is also puzzling since Steve Bannon is not exactly Bambi when it comes to dealing with the press. He's probably the most media-savvy person in America,\" Kuttner writes.\n\n\"We're at economic war with China,\" Bannon told the Prospect. \"One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years, and it's gonna be them if we go down this path. On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow.\"\n\nBannon added that \"the economic war with China is everything,\" arguing the US needs to be \"maniacally focused on that.\"\n\n\"If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover,\" Bannon said.\n\nThe President's chief strategist, who has taken on an expansive portfolio from trade issues to the US's foreign wars and US manufacturing, also laid out his plans for the Trump administration to take a harder line against China on trade, explaining that the President's memorandum Monday that lays the groundwork for an investigation of Chinese trade practices is just a first step.\n\n\"We're going to run the tables on these guys,\" Bannon promised in the interview, explaining that the administration also plans to lodge trade complaints against China over steel and aluminum dumping.\n\nBut Bannon also described his work to push this hardline trade agenda as a daily struggle that pits him against other top advisers to the President, including the National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn.\n\n\"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" Bannon said. \"We're still fighting. There's Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.\"\n\nBannon also accused his rivals inside the administration who have urged restraint on trade of \"wetting themselves\" over the issue.\n\nHe went on to articulate how he is reshuffling the US's foreign policy apparatus, explaining that he is seeking the ouster of the Acting Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs at the State Department and \"getting hawks in.\"\n\nThe comments about his colleagues could place Bannon in a more precarious position inside the White House, whose staff is now being led by retired Gen. John Kelly.\n\nBannon's comments come just two weeks after White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci was fired after he badmouthed colleagues in vulgar terms in a conversation with The New Yorker.\n\nPolitical Fix from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n\nBe informed.

Bannon told Kuttner he \"absolutely nailed it,\" and said he saw no reason to curtail the \"economic war with China,\" since Beijing won't take stronger action against Pyongyang and mutually assured destruction will rein in both sides. Then he contradicted Trump's threat to respond to any provocations from North Korea with \"fire and fury\":\n\nThere's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats], forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\n\nWhen asked about those in the Trump administration who still want to enlist China's help, Bannon said \"Oh, they're wetting themselves.\" He claimed he's replacing East Asian Defense officials with \"hawks,\" and getting Susan Thornton, the acting head of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, fired from the State Department. But can Bannon take on so many of his colleagues?\n\n\"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" he said. \"We're still fighting. There's Treasury and [National Economic Council chair] Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.\"\n\n\"We gotta do this. The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy. Don't get me wrong. It's like, every day.\"\n\nBannon suggested he was calling Kuttner because he needed the backing of trade hawks on both the left and the right. As Kuttner notes, the idea that working with liberals would help Bannon win his war against other Trump officials does not make sense. Nor does the idea that liberals would ally themselves with one of the White House figures most closely associated with white nationalism. But Bannon had some interesting thoughts on that point:\n\nI asked Bannon about the connection between his program of economic nationalism and the ugly white nationalism epitomized by the racist violence in Charlottesville and Trump's reluctance to condemn it. Bannon, after all, was the architect of the strategy of using Breitbart to heat up white nationalism and then rely on the radical right as Trump's base.\n\nHe dismissed the far right as irrelevant and sidestepped his own role in cultivating it: \"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more.\"\n\n\"These guys are a collection of clowns,\" he added.\n\nFrom his lips to Trump's ear.\n\n\"The Democrats,\" he said, \"the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nKuttner says \"the question of whether the phone call was on or off the record never came up.\" A short time after the piece went up, crashing The American Prospect's servers, Axios reported that Bannon thought he was discussing Kuttner's piece off the record, not giving an interview.\n\nNevertheless, Bannon's colleagues are said to be fuming. One of his coworkers, who isn't usually a Bannon enemy, told Axios: \"Since Steve apparently enjoys casually undermining U.S. national security, I'll put this in terms he'll understand: This is DEFCON 1-level bad.\"\n\nBannon is one of the most politically savvy people in the country, and prior to joining the Trump administration he ran a media company for several years. So, what's Bannon really up to? Here are some possibilities to ponder.\n\nTheory 1: Even Chief Strategists Make Mistakes\n\nKuttner told CNN he doubts Bannon was confused about the conversation because \"The default setting\" is \"on the record.\" Jonathan Swan, who penned the Axios report, thinks Bannon may have been overcome by his excitement about a trade war with China:\n\nAnd some think that as with the Mooch, this slip will prove fatal:\n\nTheory 2: Bannon Leaked on Purpose\n\nMany said Bannon is too smart to make such a rookie mistake, and this is just more Littlefingering - but to what end? To manipulate the left?\n\nTo score points in his feud against National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster?\n\nTo show Trump who's boss?\n\nOr, does Bannon actually think an aide's uncensored remarks can distract from the president's repeated, historic failure to properly condemn white supremacy?\n\nTheory 3: Bannon Doesn't Care If He's Fired\n\nIf you're going down, why not go out swinging, one year to the day after you first joined the Trump campaign?\n\nThe Mooch set a high (or maybe low) bar.\n\nSources American Prospect Axios", "id": "9646716", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Why Did Bannon Bash His Colleagues to a Liberal Journalist?", "image":

It's a fringe element,\" Bannon told the magazine. \"I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, eh, help crush it more.\"\n\n\"These guys are a collection of clowns,\" he added.\n\nThe remarks were startling coming from Bannon, who spent more than four years running the far-right website Breitbart News before he was tapped to join Trump's campaign.\n\nBannon, the site's former executive chair, has called the Breitbart \"a platform of the alt-right,\" referring to the small, deeply conservative movement that seeks a whites-only state. It was his strategy to use the site to channel white supremacist support for Trump and provide a mouthpiece for his populist message during the 2016 election, a move that helped secure him a senior role in the administration.\n\nIn the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, which left a counterprotester dead and others injured, civil rights leaders have called on Trump to fire Bannon over his ties to the white nationalist community, as The Washington Post has reported.\n\nAsked by reporters Tuesday if he still had confidence in his chief strategist, Trump deflected.\n\n\"He's not a racist, I can tell you that,\" Trump said. \"But we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\"\n\nKuttner wrote in Wednesday's article that he was surprised when he got an email from one of Bannon's assistants saying he wanted to arrange a meeting. The two ended up speaking by phone on Tuesday afternoon, according to the article.\n\nWhen the conversation turned to race and the events in Charlottesville, Bannon dodged questions about his role in cultivating the alt-right, according to the article. He also faulted Democrats for focusing on identity politics.\n\n\"The longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" he said.\" I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nKuttner said he was puzzled by the fact that Bannon would call an editor at a progressive magazine \"assume that a possible convergence of views on China trade might somehow paper over the political and moral chasm on white nationalism.\"\n\n\"The question of whether the phone call was on or off the record never came up,\" he said. \"This is also puzzling, since Stephen K. Bannon is not exactly Bambi when it comes to dealing with the press. He's probably the most media-savvy person in America.\"", "id": "9675265", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Steve Bannon says rivals 'wetting themselves,' calls supremacists 'clowns,' contradicts Trump on N.

He has since been charged with second degree murder.\n\nIn the American Prospect story, headlined 'Steve Bannon, unrepentant', Mr Bannon said: \"We're at economic war with China. It's in all their literature. They're not shy about saying what they're doing. One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path. On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow.\"\n\nContradicting Mr Trump's threats of \"fire and fury\" on North Korea, Mr Bannon said: \"There's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats], forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nMr Bannon was also asked about the white nationalism epitomised by the violence in Charlottesville and Mr Trump's reluctance to condemn it.\n\nHe dismissed the far right as \"irrelevant\", and told Kuttner: \"Ethno-nationalism - it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more ? These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\nRegarding the Democrats, Bannon said: \"The longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nKuttner wrote that he had never spoken to Mr Bannon before and that the question of whether the call was on or off the record never came up.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, Mr Trump's short-lived communications director, was recently fired after he called up a reporter and launched a foul-mouthed rant against senior colleagues, including Mr Bannon.\n\nThe aide has attracted significant controversy during his time at the White House, where he was blamed for the failed implementation of the travel ban, which was quickly blocked by the courts.\n\nIt has been reported that the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his wife, Ivanka Trump, have long urged Mr Bannon's dismissal.\n\nThe president tried to downplay Mr Bannon's influence on his campaign at the recent press conference, saying: \"I like Mr Bannon. He's a friend of mine.

Bannon, the White House chief strategist, seemed to take issue with President Donald Trump on North Korea, attacked white supremacists as \"clowns\" and \"losers\" and described his efforts against administration rivals in an unusual interview Wednesday with The American Prospect, a progressive magazine.\n\nThe interview with magazine co-editor and columnist Robert Kuttner was initiated by Bannon, Kuttner said, in an Anthony Scaramucci-style phone call out of the blue in response to a column Kuttner had written on China.\n\n\"Bannon was in high spirits when he phoned me Tuesday afternoon to discuss the politics of taking a harder line with China, and minced no words describing his efforts to neutralize rivals at the Departments of Defense, State and Treasury,\" wrote Kuttner.\n\n\"'They're wetting themselves,' he said, proceeding to detail how he would oust some of his opponents at State and Defense.\"\n\nOn North Korea, Bannon said: \"'Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.'\"\n\nThat comment seemed at odds with Trump's \"fire and fury\" threats to use military force against North Korea.\n\nOn China, Bannon told Kuttner that the United States was at \"economic war\" and warned that \"one of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path,\" according to the article.\n\n\"On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow,\" he said.\n\nBannon was also asked by Kuttner to comment on the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville last weekend and President' Trump's reluctance to condemn the participants.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element,\" Bannon told the magazine. \"I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, eh, help crush it more.\"\n\n\"These guys are a collection of clowns,\" he added.\n\nThe remarks were startling coming from Bannon, who spent more than four years running the far-right website Breitbart News before he was tapped to join Trump's campaign.\n\nBannon, the site's former executive chair, has called the Breitbart \"a platform of the alt-right,\" referring to the small, deeply conservative movement that seeks a whites-only state. It was his strategy to use the site to channel white supremacist support for Trump and provide a mouthpiece for his populist message during the 2016 election, a move that helped secure him a senior role in the administration.\n\nIn the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, which left a counterprotester dead and others injured, civil rights leaders have called on Trump to fire Bannon over his ties to the white nationalist community, as The Washington Post has reported.\n\nAsked by reporters Tuesday if he still had confidence in his chief strategist, Trump deflected.\n\n\"He's not a racist, I can tell you that,\" Trump said. \"But we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\"\n\nKuttner wrote in Wednesday's article that he was surprised when he got an email from one of Bannon's assistants saying he wanted to arrange a meeting. The two ended up speaking by phone on Tuesday afternoon, according to the article.\n\nWhen the conversation turned to race and the events in Charlottesville, Bannon dodged questions about his role in cultivating the alt-right, according to the article. He also faulted Democrats for focusing on identity politics.\n\n\"The longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" he said. \"I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nKuttner said he was puzzled by the fact that Bannon would call an editor at a progressive magazine and \"assume that a possible convergence of views on China trade might somehow paper over the political and moral chasm on white nationalism.\"\n\n\"The question of whether the phone call was on or off the record never came up,\" he said. \"This is also puzzling, since Stephen K. Bannon is not exactly Bambi when it comes to dealing with the press. He's probably the most media-savvy person in America.\"", "id": "9706987", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Steve Bannon says rivals 'wetting themselves,' calls supremacists 'clowns'",

He never asked for the conversation to be off the record -- which seems to have been a catastrophic mistake for Bannon, one that someone with his media experience should not have made. The article (\"Steve Bannon, Unrepentant\") has been taken down, or at least the link is invalid. But a reader grabbed the cached version and sent it to me as a PDF.\n\nIt's stunning. It is impossible to believe that Bannon wanted this to be on the record, unless he's playing twelve-dimensional chess. Excerpts:\n\nContrary to Trump's threat of fire and fury, Bannon said: \"There's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats], forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\" Bannon went on to describe his battle inside the administration to take a harder line on China trade, and not to fall into a trap of wishful thinking in which complaints against China's trade practices now had to take a backseat to the hope that China, as honest broker, would help restrain Kim.\n\n\"To me,\" Bannon said, \"the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nSo, right there he undercuts his boss on North Korea.\n\nMore:\n\nBannon explained that his strategy is to battle the trade doves inside the administration while building an outside coalition of trade hawks that includes left as well as right. Hence the phone call to me.\n\nThere are a couple of things that are startling about this premise. First, to the extent that most of the opponents of Bannon's China trade strategy are other Trump administration officials, it's not clear how reaching out to the left helps him. If anything, it gives his adversaries ammunition to characterize Bannon as unreliable or disloyal.\n\nMore puzzling is the fact that Bannon would phone a writer and editor of a progressive publication (the cover lines on whose first two issues after Trump's election were \"Resisting Trump\" and \"Containing Trump\") and assume that a possible convergence of views on China trade might somehow paper over the political and moral chasm on white nationalism.\n\nThe question of whether the phone call was on or off the record never came up. This is also puzzling, since Steve Bannon is not exactly Bambi when it comes to dealing with the press. He's probably the most media-savvy person in America.\n\nAnd get this:\n\nI asked Bannon about the connection between his program of economic nationalism and the ugly white nationalism epitomized by the racist violence in Charlottesville and Trump's reluctance to condemn it. Bannon, after all, was the architect of the strategy of using Breitbart to heat up white nationalism and then rely on the radical right as Trump's base.\n\nHe dismissed the far right as irrelevant and sidestepped his own role in cultivating it: \"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more.\"\n\n\"These guys are a collection of clowns,\" he added.\n\nFrom his lips to Trump's ear.\n\n\"The Democrats,\" he said, \"the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nSteve Bannon, on the alt-right: \"These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\nEither Bannon is a genius, or he's reckless and crazy. Or maybe he's both, but his recklessness outran his genius this one time. I can't see how he survives having talked so loosely to a journalist -- a liberal journalist at that -- about administration infighting and the White House's approach to North Korea and China.

Bannon, the White House chief strategist, seemed to take issue with President Donald Trump on North Korea, attacked white supremacists as \"clowns\" and \"losers\" and described his efforts against administration rivals in an unusual interview Wednesday with The American Prospect, a progressive magazine.\n\nThe interview with magazine co-editor and columnist Robert Kuttner was initiated by Bannon, Kuttner said, in an Anthony Scaramucci-style phone call out of the blue in response to a column Kuttner had written on China.\n\n\"Bannon was in high spirits when he phoned me Tuesday afternoon to discuss the politics of taking a harder line with China, and minced no words describing his efforts to neutralize rivals at the Departments of Defense, State and Treasury,\" wrote Kuttner.\n\n\"'They're wetting themselves,' he said, proceeding to detail how he would oust some of his opponents at State and Defense.\"\n\nOn North Korea, Bannon said: \"'Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.'\"\n\nThat comment seemed at odds with Trump's \"fire and fury\" threats to use military force against North Korea.\n\nOn China, Bannon told Kuttner that the United States was at \"economic war\" and warned that \"one of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path,\" according to the article.\n\n\"On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow,\" he said.\n\nBannon was also asked by Kuttner to comment on the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville last weekend and President' Trump's reluctance to condemn the participants.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism - it's losers. It's a fringe element,\" Bannon told the magazine. \"I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, eh, help crush it more.\"\n\n\"These guys are a collection of clowns,\" he added.\n\nThe remarks were startling coming from Bannon, who spent more than four years running the far-right website Breitbart News before he was tapped to join Trump's campaign.\n\nBannon, the site's former executive chair, has called the Breitbart \"a platform of the alt-right,\" referring to the small, deeply conservative movement that seeks a whites-only state. It was his strategy to use the site to channel white supremacist support for Trump and provide a mouthpiece for his populist message during the 2016 election, a move that helped secure him a senior role in the administration.\n\nIn the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, which left a counterprotester dead and others injured, civil rights leaders have called on Trump to fire Bannon over his ties to the white nationalist community, as The Washington Post has reported.\n\nAsked by reporters Tuesday if he still had confidence in his chief strategist, Trump deflected.\n\n\"He's not a racist, I can tell you that,\" Trump said. \"But we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\"\n\nKuttner wrote in Wednesday's article that he was surprised when he got an email from one of Bannon's assistants saying he wanted to arrange a meeting. The two ended up speaking by phone on Tuesday afternoon, according to the article.\n\nWhen the conversation turned to race and the events in Charlottesville, Bannon dodged questions about his role in cultivating the alt-right, according to the article. He also faulted Democrats for focusing on identity politics.\n\n\"The longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" he said. \"I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nKuttner said he was puzzled by the fact that Bannon would call an editor at a progressive magazine and \"assume that a possible convergence of views on China trade might somehow paper over the political and moral chasm on white nationalism.\"\n\n\"The question of whether the phone call was on or off the record never came up,\" he said. \"This is also puzzling, since Stephen K.

The law under which that measure was drafted, Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, would allow Trump to place a tariff on another country without Congressional approval.\n\nThe plans to reshape US-China trade policies do not end there, Bannon indicated. He talked of shifting people within the Trump administration to achieve expansive goals on that front.\n\n\"I'm changing out people at East Asian Defense; I'm getting hawks in,\" Bannon said. \"I'm getting Susan Thornton [acting head of East Asian and Pacific Affairs] out at State.\"\n\nBannon continued: \"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" he said. \"We're still fighting.\"\n\nKuttner openly questioned why Bannon, a former executive of the far-right news outlet Breitbart, called him -- a reporter for a progressive-leaning publication -- to sound off about some of his biggest plans for the White House's economic agenda.\n\nHere's Kuttner:\n\n\"Bannon explained that his strategy is to battle the trade doves inside the administration while building an outside coalition of trade hawks that includes left as well as right. Hence the phone call to me.\"\n\nBannon said later that he was unaware the conversation was on-the-record.\n\nSteve Bannon. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nBannon's comments came after days of scorching fallout from Trump's response to a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The president has been dragged by Republican and Democratic leaders, and abandoned by CEOs of some of the biggest American corporations after Trump wavered in his denunciations of some hate groups involved in the violence.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element,\" Bannon said, apparently referring to demonstrators without describing any specific ethnicity, adding that \"the media plays it up too much.\"\n\n\"These guys are a collection of clowns,\" Bannon said.\n\nSome critics have pointed to Bannon, who they accused of influencing Trump's reactions to the violence in Virginia. Although Bannon spoke with Trump several times last weekend, according to the news website Axios, he \"has not meaningfully advised\" Trump on his response to Charlottesville, the publication said.\n\nBannon's immediate future in the White House has also been called into question in the aftermath of Charlottesville, with several lawmakers urging Trump to fire him. Trump said during a fiery news conference on Tuesday: \"We'll see about Mr. Bannon.\"", "id": "9762994", "details": {"liCnt": 5}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Steve Bannon trashes

Bannon, the White House chief strategist, seemed to take issue with President Donald Trump on North Korea, attacked white supremacists as \"clowns\" and \"losers\" and described his efforts against administration rivals in an unusual interview Wednesday with The American Prospect, a progressive magazine.\n\nThe interview with magazine co-editor and columnist Robert Kuttner was initiated by Bannon, Kuttner said, in an Anthony Scaramucci-style phone call out of the blue in response to a column Kuttner had written on China.\n\n\"Bannon was in high spirits when he phoned me Tuesday afternoon to discuss the politics of taking a harder line with China, and minced no words describing his efforts to neutralize rivals at the Departments of Defense, State and Treasury,\" wrote Kuttner.\n\n\"'They're wetting themselves,' he said, proceeding to detail how he would oust some of his opponents at State and Defense.\"\n\nOn North Korea, Bannon said: \"'Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.'\"\n\nThat comment seemed at odds with Trump's \"fire and fury\" threats to use military force against North Korea.\n\nOn China, Bannon told Kuttner that the United States was at \"economic war\" and warned that \"one of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path,\" according to the article.\n\n\"On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow,\" he said.\n\nBannon was also asked by Kuttner to comment on the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville last weekend and President' Trump's reluctance to condemn the participants.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism - it's losers. It's a fringe element,\" Bannon told the magazine. \"I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, eh, help crush it more.\"\n\n\"These guys are a collection of clowns,\" he added.\n\nThe remarks were startling coming from Bannon, who spent more than four years running the far-right website Breitbart News before he was tapped to join Trump's campaign.\n\nBannon, the site's former executive chair, has called the Breitbart \"a platform of the alt-right,\" referring to the small, deeply conservative movement that seeks a whites-only state. It was his strategy to use the site to channel white supremacist support for Trump and provide a mouthpiece for his populist message during the 2016 election, a move that helped secure him a senior role in the administration.\n\nIn the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, which left a counterprotester dead and others injured, civil rights leaders have called on Trump to fire Bannon over his ties to the white nationalist community, as The Washington Post has reported.\n\nAsked by reporters Tuesday if he still had confidence in his chief strategist, Trump deflected.\n\n\"He's not a racist, I can tell you that,\" Trump said. \"But we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\"\n\nKuttner wrote in Wednesday's article that he was surprised when he got an email from one of Bannon's assistants saying he wanted to arrange a meeting. The two ended up speaking by phone on Tuesday afternoon, according to the article.\n\nWhen the conversation turned to race and the events in Charlottesville, Bannon dodged questions about his role in cultivating the alt-right, according to the article. He also faulted Democrats for focusing on identity politics.\n\n\"The longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" he said. \"I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nKuttner said he was puzzled by the fact that Bannon would call an editor at a progressive magazine and \"assume that a possible convergence of views on China trade might somehow paper over the political and moral chasm on white nationalism.\"\n\n\"The question of whether the phone call was on or off the record never came up,\" he said. \"This is also puzzling, since Stephen K. Bannon is not exactly Bambi when it comes to dealing with the press. He's probably the most media-savvy person in America.\"\n\nbannon\n\nWashington Post News Service (DC)\n\n8/17/2017 6:55:18 AM Central Daylight Time", "id": "9738499", "details": {}, "date":

Indeed, he appears to be on thin ice in the Trump White House, with reports indicating that Chief of Staff John Kelly has soured on him, and Trump telling reporters \"we'll see\" if Bannon stays in the White House.\n\nSo it was somewhat surprising to see him offer, unsolicited, an in-depth policy interview to a small labor-liberal publication in DC (the post is currently crashing the magazine's servers; a cached version is available here). According to Axios's Jonathan Swan, Bannon did not realize that he had agreed to an interview: \"Apparently Bannon never thought that the journalist might take his (very newsworthy) comments and turn them into a story.\" According to the Prospect, Bannon never specified that the comments were off the record, a strange blunder from the White House's chief strategist and a former media executive.\n\nIt was particularly surprising, in light of the deadly white supremacist rally and riots in Charlottesville, VA, whose participants Trump has declined to distance himself from and even partially defended, that Bannon told the Prospect, \"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more. These guys are a collection of clowns.\" It's a big shift for Bannon, who just last summer proudly declared Breitbart, which he used to run, the \"platform for the alt-right.\"\n\nBannon had called up Robert Kuttner, the publication's co-founder and co-editor, and a veteran left-leaning voice in Democratic circles, after a column Kuttner had written about Trump, China and North Korea.\n\nBannon told Kuttner he'd \"followed your writing for years and I think you and I are in same boat when it comes to China.\" Bannon's not wrong there. Kuttner is a vocal critic of international trade deals and in particular of China's trade behavior. \"If the Western democracies had a realistic conception of their long-term interest, they would add high tariffs to Chinese goods until China began behaving like a normal commercial nation,\" Kuttner wrote in 2009. \"The proceeds could be used to rebuild our own industry.\"\n\nIn the interview, Bannon struck a similar tone, promising an \"economic war\" against China and laying out exactly how he'd want it to go down:\n\n\"To me,\" Bannon said, \"the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nBannon's plan of attack includes: a complaint under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act against Chinese coercion of technology transfers from American corporations doing business there, and follow-up complaints against steel and aluminum dumping. \"We're going to run the tables on these guys. We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us.\"\n\nThe President has significant authority under federal law to retaliate against countries he believes are trading unfairly. Section 301, for example, authorizes tariffs and quotas against a country ruled to be engaging in \"unjustifiable, unreasonable, or discriminatory\" trading behavior. There are a number of statutes Trump could choose from in bringing tariffs against Chinese steel and aluminum. These would likely cause China to retaliate with tariffs of its own, launching an international trade war leaving everyone, particularly poor people in China, worse off.\n\nOne geopolitical reason not to do this is that China is by far the largest trading partner of North Korea, which gives it significant economic leverage with which to pressure the regime. The Trump administration might want to stay on China's good side to try to push North Korea to stop missile tests and slow its nuclear program.\n\nBut Bannon suggests that for him, at least, this is not a priority:\n\nBannon said he might consider a deal in which China got North Korea to freeze its nuclear buildup with verifiable inspections and the United States removed its troops from the peninsula, but such a deal seemed remote. Given that China is not likely to do much more on North Korea, and that the logic of mutually assured destruction was its own source of restraint, Bannon saw no reason not to proceed with tough trade sanctions against China.\n\nContrary to Trump's threat of fire and fury, Bannon said: \"There's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats], forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\n\nThis is significantly less hawkish rhetoric than that of Trump himself, who has promised \"fire and fury like the world has never seen\" if North Korea issues further provocations. It's even a bit less hawkish than National Security Advisor HR McMaster, considered a more conventional conservative relative to Bannon's nationalist alt-right ideology,\n\nOf course, Bannon's views are not those of the whole Trump administration. He was forthright with Kuttner about the resistance he's received to his protectionist views on China from people like Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and National Economic Council chair Gary Cohn: \"That's a fight I fight every day here. We're still fighting. There's Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.\" He said he was planning to oust several lower-down State and Defense Department officials who might object to economic war with China; he named Susan Thornton, the principal deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, as one example of someone he wants to fire.\n\nWhile Bannon dismissed his would-be allies in the alt-right or ethno-nationalist right, he still argued for the importance of focusing politics around race: \"The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nThe choice of venue for the interview is perplexing, to say the least. The Prospect was the first place I ever interned in Washington, and it launched the careers of Vox's Ezra Klein, Matthew Yglesias, and Kay Steiger, as well as those of influential liberal writers like Adam Serwer, Dana Goldstein, Garance Franke-Ruta, and Josh Marshall. I feel confident in saying that none of us would've predicted the Prospect or Kuttner as Bannon's preferred interviewer.\n\nAnd Bannon's candor and open opposition to other administration members could very well wind up getting him fired, just as communications director Anthony Scaramucci was pushed out after giving an ill-advised and unsolicited interview to the New Yorker's Ryan Lizza.\n\nIn the meantime, though, he's given us a surprisingly detailed a revealing glimpse into his thought process, and the policy agenda that at least some of the White House is interested in pursuing.", "id":

He appeared to contradict President Donald Trump on North Korea, downplaying the possibility of military force. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nWith his employment status in the Trump administration tenuous at best, White House chief strategist Steve Bannon cut loose in an interview with The American Prospect on Tuesday on North Korea, white nationalists, and trade with China, sometimes contradicting the president.\n\nBannon called editor Robert Kuttner apparently eager to get some things off his chest about the hot topics surrounding the administration. He appeared to contradict President Donald Trump on North Korea, downplaying the possibility of military force after Trump threatened the communist nation with \"fire and fury.\"\n\n\"There's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats], forget it,\" Bannon said. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nBannon's take on the North Korea situation is in direct conflict with Trump's insistence that further aggressive actions by North Korea would be met with military force by the United States.\n\n\"North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States,\" Trump said Aug. 8 during a meeting on opioids from his golf club in New Jersey. \"They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen ... he has been very threatening beyond a normal state. They will be met with fire, fury and frankly power the likes of which this world has never seen before.\"\n\nIn the conversation, Bannon also emphasized the need to focus on winning the economic war against China and that the administration should not soften up on Chinese trade practices hoping for more assistance with North Korea.\n\n\"We're at economic war with China,\" Bannon said. \"It's in all their literature. They're not shy about saying what they're doing. One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path. On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow.\"\n\nBannon detailed his intention to fire employees at the State Department, including Susan Thornton, the head of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, in order to advance his China policies.\n\nWhen asked about the recent surge in white nationalist activism that culminated in the Charlottesville protests, Bannon dismissed the far-right activists as \"clowns,\" \"losers\" and \"fringe elements\" while re-emphasizing his focus on economic nationalism. Bannon was the driving force behind Breitbart's strategy to stir up the far-right and use that base to help get Trump elected.\n\n\"The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" Bannon said. \"I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nBannon is reportedly facing an uncertain future in the White House, with Trump giving a tepid \"we'll see\" in response to questions about Bannon's job security earlier this week.", "id": "9770483", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Steve Bannon undermines Trump's North Korea rhetoric", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/GettyImages-691278358-1280x720.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 1476, "date": "2017-08-08", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1482}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "120", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": null, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Korea"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "65773", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Korea"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "65774", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "216558", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}, "id": "303326", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State"}, {"label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}, "id": "303910", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}, "id": "304050", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Communism"}, "id": "304261", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}, "id": "305090", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nation"}, "id": "308370", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hegemony"}, "id": "317584", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony"}, {"label": {"eng": "Second Sino-Japanese War"}, "id": "327858", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "348464", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia", "label": {"eng": "East Asia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "The American Prospect"}, "id": "350087", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Prospect"}, {"label": {"eng": "Identity politics"}, "id": "366725", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Economic nationalism"}, "id": "379906", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}, "id": "394340", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Kuttner"}, "id": "743029", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kuttner"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic"}], "time": "20:16:00"}

Donald Trump and his team routinely lash out at major mainstream outlets, while praising, promoting, and providing access to the administration's conservative allies.\n\nOnce in a great while, though, a curve ball crosses the plate.\n\nThe United States is in an economic war with China, U.S. President Donald Trump's chief political strategist has said, warning Washington is losing the fight but is about to hit China hard over unfair trade practices.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with [The American Prospect] published Wednesday, Steve Bannon also weighed in on worsening tensions between the U.S. and North Korea, and the furor caused by white nationalist marches in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend.\n\nFor those who don't know, The American Prospect is an unapologetically progressive political magazine. The fact that Bannon called its co-editor and co-founder, Robert Kuttner, unprompted and out of the blue, is unexpected. (The liberal journalists concedes in the piece he was \"stunned.\")\n\nAnd yet, Trump's controversial chief strategist didn't just reach out to Kuttner; Bannon also had all kinds of insights to share. Among the highlights:\n\n* Bannon told the Prospect he intends to neutralize his rivals at the Departments of Defense, State, and Treasury. \"They're wetting themselves,\" he told Kuttner, before naming names of various opponents within the administration. (Bannon vowed, for example to oust Susan Thornton, the acting head of East Asian and Pacific Affairs at State.)\n\n* As far as Bannon is concerned, the United States is already \"at economic war with China.\" He added, \"To me, the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that.... We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us.\"\n\n* Despite the president's bluster towards North Korea, Bannon dismissed the idea of a confrontation. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here,\" He told Kuttner, adding, \"They got us.\"\n\n* Bannon apparently called The American Prospect because he's cultivating some kind of coalition of hawks on trade, which would include some liberals.\n\n* On the most radical elements of Trump's base, Bannon told Kuttner, \"Ethno-nationalism - it's losers. It's a fringe element.\" He added, \"These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\n* And on a related note, Bannon concluded in reference to Democrats, \"I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nI find it hard to believe this will help Bannon's status in the West Wing, which, by some measures, was already precarious. If Trump worries about his chief strategist's self-promotion, selling himself to the media as the genius behind the throne, the fact that Bannon called a progressive magazine to share his perspective on a variety of issues - including undercutting the president's posturing on North Korea - won't help.\n\nThe New York Times' piece on this said that Bannon apparently thought the conversation was off the record. Kuttner wrote, \"The question of whether the phone call was on or off the record never came up.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, Bannon isn't new to the game and he's well aware of the rules when chatting with a journalist.\n\nDisclosure: I should probably note that I've written for The American Prospect several times, and in 2006, I ran the magazine's campaign blog.", "id": "9722297", "details": {},

Bannon, the White House chief strategist, seemed to take issue with President Trump on North Korea, attacked white supremacists as \"clowns\" and \"losers\" and described his efforts against administration rivals in an unusual interview Wednesday with The American Prospect, a progressive magazine.\n\nThe phone interview with magazine co-editor and columnist Robert Kuttner was initiated by Bannon, Kuttner said, in response to a column Kuttner had written on China.\n\n\"Bannon was in high spirits when he phoned me Tuesday afternoon to discuss the politics of taking a harder line with China, and minced no words describing his efforts to neutralize rivals at the Departments of Defense, State and Treasury,\" wrote Kuttner.\n\n\"They're wetting themselves,\" Bannon told Kuttner, proceeding to detail how he would oust some of his opponents at State and Defense.\"\n\nOn North Korea, Bannon said: \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nThat comment seems at odds with Trump's \"fire and fury\" threats to use military force against North Korea.\n\nOn China, Bannon told Kuttner that the United States was at \"economic war\" and warned that \"one of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path,\" according to the article.\n\n\"On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow,\" he said.\n\nBannon was also asked by Kuttner to comment on the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville last weekend and President Trump's reluctance to condemn the participants.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism - it's losers. It's a fringe element,\" Bannon told the magazine. \"I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, eh, help crush it more.\"\n\n\"These guys are a collection of clowns,\" he added.\n\nThe remarks were startling coming from Bannon, who spent more than four years running the far-right website Breitbart News before he was tapped to join Trump's campaign.\n\nBannon, the site's former executive chair, has called the Breitbart \"a platform of the alt-right,\" referring to the small, deeply conservative movement that seeks a whites-only state. It was his strategy to use the site to channel white supremacist support for Trump and provide a mouthpiece for his populist message during the 2016 election, a move that helped secure him a senior role in the administration.\n\nIn the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, which left a counterprotester dead and others injured, civil rights leaders have called on Trump to fire Bannon over his ties to the white nationalist community, as The Washington Post has reported.\n\nAsked by reporters Tuesday if he still had confidence in his chief strategist, Trump deflected.\n\n\"He's not a racist, I can tell you that,\" Trump said. \"But we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\"\n\nKuttner wrote in Wednesday's article that he was surprised when he got an email from one of Bannon's assistants saying he wanted to arrange a meeting. The two ended up speaking by phone on Tuesday afternoon, according to the article.\n\nWhen the conversation turned to race and the events in Charlottesville, Bannon dodged questions about his role in cultivating the alt-right, according to the article. He also faulted Democrats for focusing on identity politics.\n\n\"The longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" he said. \"I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nKuttner said he was puzzled by the fact that Bannon would call an editor at a progressive magazine and \"assume that a possible convergence of views on China trade might somehow paper over the political and moral chasm on white nationalism.\"\n\n\"The question of whether the phone call was on or off the record never came up,\" he said. \"This is also puzzling, since Stephen K. Bannon is not exactly Bambi when it comes to dealing with the press. He's probably the most media-savvy person in America.\"\n\nShare\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine?

Bannon, his chief strategist, as has been rumored for weeks, Bannon just gave him several new reasons.\n\nIn an interview published Wednesday by a liberal journalist, Bannon contradicted the president's position on North Korea, bad-mouthed his colleagues in the administration, vowed to oust a female diplomat at the State Department and mocked Trump officials who fear the consequences of radically changing trade policy, saying they are \"wetting themselves.\"\n\nPeople close to Bannon said he believed the comments were part of an off-the-record conversation with Robert Kuttner with The American Prospect that, according to the magazine, he initiated.\n\nStill, they come as Bannon's adversaries are aggressively seeking his ouster from the White House because of his links to Breitbart News, his feuding with other White House aides and a suspicion that he is the source of leaks about internal chaos inside the West Wing.\n\nBannon's critics intensified their efforts after last weekend's racial unrest in Charlottesville, Virginia. Outraged over Trump's insistence that \"both sides\" were to blame for the violence that erupted during a white nationalist rally, leaving one woman dead, human rights activists demanded that the president fire so-called nationalists working in the West Wing. That group of hard-right populists in the White House is led by Bannon.\n\nOn Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York, Trump refused to guarantee Bannon's job security but defended him as \"not a racist\" and \"a friend.\"\n\n\"We'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon,\" Trump said.\n\nIn the American Prospect article, titled \"Steve Bannon, Unrepentant,\" the president's strategist appears eager to lash out at his ideological rivals in the administration, bragging about his ability to defeat those who oppose a more aggressive posture toward China on trade policy.\n\n\"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" Bannon said. \"We're still fighting. There's Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.\" Cohn is the director of the National Economic Council at the White House.\n\nHe also specifically named Susan Thornton, the acting director of the East Asian and Pacific Affairs division at the State Department, as someone he will dispatch.\n\n\"I'm changing out people at East Asian Defense; I'm getting hawks in,\" he said. \"I'm getting Susan Thornton out at State.\"\n\nJust a week after the president repeatedly threatened North Korea with military action in response to Pyongyang's nuclear missile program, Bannon mocked that position as nonsensical.\n\n\"There's no military solution, forget it,\" he said. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nSpeaking Tuesday, the same day that Trump was being assailed for his response to the Charlottesville protests, Bannon also dismissed the right-wing fringe as \"a collection of clowns.\" He said the more liberals talk about \"identity politics,\" the easier it will be for Trump to defeat Democrats by focusing on economic nationalism.\n\nBannon told friends that he did not believe that his conversation was on the record. But Bannon is a savvy media operator who rarely speaks without a clear understanding of the rules. Kuttner said the issue of whether the call was on the record never came up.", "id": "9705121", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Bannon contradicts Trump on North Korea and lashes out at

They're not shy about saying what they're doing. One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\n\"If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she had seen the report, and reiterated the essence of the China-U.S. trade relationship is mutually beneficial.\n\n\"In reality, China and the United States' long term cooperation has brought about real benefits for both countries' peoples, any unbiased person will clearly see this fact,\" she told a daily news briefing in Beijing.\n\n\"We have also said before, a trade war has no future. A trade war does not serve the interests of any party, as fighting a trade war will not produce a winner. We hope that relevant parties can stop viewing issues of the 21st century with a 19th- or 20th-century mentality.\"\n\nBannon said the United States would use Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act against Chinese coercion of technology transfers from U.S. corporations doing business in China and follow up with complaints against steel and aluminium dumping, according to prospect.org.\n\nOn Monday, Trump authorised an inquiry into China's alleged theft of intellectual property in the first direct trade measure by his administration against Beijing.\n\n\"We're going to run the tables on these guys. We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us,\" said Bannon, who acknowledged he was battling trade doves within the U.S. administration.\n\nHe said there was no reason to go soft on China in order to get Beijing's support over North Korea because he believed China would do little more to rein in Pyongyang.\n\nBannon said he might consider a deal in which China got North Korea to freeze its nuclear build-up with verifiable inspections and the United States removed its troops from the Korean peninsula, but such a deal seemed remote, prospect.org reported.\n\nIn contrast to Trump's threat of \"fire and fury\" against North Korea, Bannon said: \"There's no military solution, forget it.\"\n\n\"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about ...\"\n\nAsked about any connection between his economic nationalism and white nationalism in the United States, and in particular the racist violence in Charlottesville, Bannon said: \"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element.\"\n\n\"I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more. These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\nHowever, Bannon, who formerly led the right-wing website Breitbart, said focusing on race would help the Republicans politically.", "id": "9671606",

'Plus, distance from actual racists is a good thing.'\n\nBannon had told American Prospect that Democrats' fixation on race politics instead of jobs and the economy would be their doom in 2020.\n\n'The longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day,' he boasted.\n\n'If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.'\n\nBannon told DailyMail.com that he had successfully 'changed the narrative' with a single phone call\n\nBannon wants to acknowledge an existing all-out economic war between China and the United States. He is pictured with new interim White House Communications Director Hope Hicks at the West Wing earlier this year\n\nIn Wednesday's interview, Bannon sought to put a wall between himself and 'alt-right' conservatives who once found an ideological bedfellow in Breitbart News, the website he led until last year.\n\n'Ethno-nationalism - it's losers,' he said. 'It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it.'\n\nBannon's conversation with writer Robert Kuttner seemed reminiscent of fired White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci's infamous job-ending phone call to a New Yorker reporter - without The Mooch's four-letter-words.\n\nIt reads like a conversation Bannon may have initially thought was off-the-record. The New York Times reported Thursday that people close to Bannon say he didn't think he would be quoted.\n\nIn the interview, Bannon directly contradicted President Donald Trump's stated policy on North Korea, a saber-rattling warning to rain 'fire and fury' down on dictator Kim Jong-Un if he didn't back off an aggressive missile test-launch posture.\n\n'There's no military solution,' Bannon said Wednesday. 'Forget it.'\n\n'Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.'\n\nGeneral Joseph Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appeared to disagree on Wednesday, telling reporters in Beijing that while peace with Pyongyang is still a 'possibility,' there are 'credible, viable military options\" for de-fanging communist dictator Kim Jong-Un.\n\n'What's unimaginable to me is not a military option,\" Dunford said. 'What is unimaginable is allowing him to develop ballistic missiles with a nuclear warhead that can threaten the United States and continue to threaten the region.'\n\nDunford did, however, call the prospect of war with North Korea 'horrific.'\n\nDuring the interview Bannon also denounced the 'alt-right' as a 'collection of clowns.' Pictured is a scene from the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday\n\nBannon also acknowledged in the magazine interview a long-running internal feud with National Economic Council chair Gary Cohn over whether to impose trade sanctions on China.\n\nWhile Cohn and others argue for a softer line in the hope that Beijing will in return help keep North Korea in check, Bannon wants to acknowledge an existing all-out economic war between China and the United States.\n\n'We're at economic war with China,' he said. 'It's in all their literature. They're not shy about saying what they're doing. One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path.'\n\n'To me the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that,' Bannon added, warning of an 'inflection point' coming in the next decade beyond which the U.S. economy could be permanently sunk.\n\nCohn and some at the Treasury Department stand in his way.\n\n'Oh, they're wetting themselves,' Bannon said, explaining that he has plans to marginalize the influence of cabinet agencies and bureaucrats who oppose him.\n\n'We're still fighting. There's Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying,' he observed.\n\n'We gotta do this. The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy.'", "id": "9708808", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Bannon defends controversial interview

Bannon, the White House chief strategist, seemed to take issue with President Trump on North Korea, attacked white supremacists as \"clowns\" and \"losers\" and described his efforts against administration rivals in an unusual interview Wednesday with The American Prospect, a progressive magazine.\n\nThe phone interview with magazine co-editor and columnist Robert Kuttner was initiated by Bannon, Kuttner said, in response to a column Kuttner had written on China.\n\n\"Bannon was in high spirits when he phoned me Tuesday afternoon to discuss the politics of taking a harder line with China, and minced no words describing his efforts to neutralize rivals at the Departments of Defense, State and Treasury,\" wrote Kuttner.\n\n\"They're wetting themselves,\" Bannon told Kuttner, proceeding to detail how he would oust some of his opponents at State and Defense.\"\n\nOn North Korea, Bannon said: \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nThat comment seems at odds with Trump's \"fire and fury\" threats to use military force against North Korea.\n\nOn China, Bannon told Kuttner that the United States was at \"economic war\" and warned that \"one of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path,\" according to the article.\n\n\"On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow,\" he said.\n\nBannon was also asked by Kuttner to comment on the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville last weekend and President Trump's reluctance to condemn the participants.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism - it's losers. It's a fringe element,\" Bannon told the magazine. \"I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, eh, help crush it more.\"\n\n\"These guys are a collection of clowns,\" he added.\n\nThe remarks were startling coming from Bannon, who spent more than four years running the far-right website Breitbart News before he was tapped to join Trump's campaign.\n\nBannon, the site's former executive chair, has called the Breitbart \"a platform of the alt-right,\" referring to the small, deeply conservative movement that seeks a whites-only state. It was his strategy to use the site to channel white supremacist support for Trump and provide a mouthpiece for his populist message during the 2016 election, a move that helped secure him a senior role in the administration.\n\nIn the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, which left a counterprotester dead and others injured, civil rights leaders have called on Trump to fire Bannon over his ties to the white nationalist community, as The Washington Post has reported.\n\nAsked by reporters Tuesday if he still had confidence in his chief strategist, Trump deflected.\n\n\"He's not a racist, I can tell you that,\" Trump said. \"But we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\"\n\nKuttner wrote in Wednesday's article that he was surprised when he got an email from one of Bannon's assistants saying he wanted to arrange a meeting. The two ended up speaking by phone on Tuesday afternoon, according to the article.\n\nWhen the conversation turned to race and the events in Charlottesville, Bannon dodged questions about his role in cultivating the alt-right, according to the article. He also faulted Democrats for focusing on identity politics.\n\n\"The longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" he said. \"I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nKuttner said he was puzzled by the fact that Bannon would call an editor at a progressive magazine and \"assume that a possible convergence of views on China trade might somehow paper over the political and moral chasm on white nationalism.\"\n\n\"The question of whether the phone call was on or off the record never came up,\" he said. \"This is also puzzling, since Stephen K. Bannon is not exactly Bambi when it comes to dealing with the press. He's probably the most media-savvy person in America.\"\n\nShare\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine? Our daily headlines email is delivered each morning.

It's just a sideshow,\" he said.\n\nBannon was also asked by Kuttner to comment on the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville last weekend and President Trump's reluctance to condemn the participants.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism - it's losers. It's a fringe element,\" Bannon told the magazine. \"I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, eh, help crush it more.\"\n\n\"These guys are a collection of clowns,\" he added.\n\nThe remarks were startling coming from Bannon, who spent more than four years running the far-right website Breitbart News before he was tapped to join Trump's campaign.\n\nBannon, the site's former executive chair, has called the Breitbart \"a platform of the alt-right,\" referring to the small, deeply conservative movement that seeks a whites-only state. It was his strategy to use the site to channel white supremacist support for Trump and provide a mouthpiece for his populist message during the 2016 election, a move that helped secure him a senior role in the administration.\n\nIn the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, which left a counterprotester dead and others injured, civil rights leaders have called on Trump to fire Bannon over his ties to the white nationalist community, as The Washington Post has reported.\n\nAsked by reporters Tuesday if he still had confidence in his chief strategist, Trump deflected.\n\n\"He's not a racist, I can tell you that,\" Trump said. \"But we'll see what happens with Mr Bannon.\"\n\nKuttner wrote in Wednesday's article that he was surprised when he got an email from one of Bannon's assistants saying he wanted to arrange a meeting. The two ended up speaking by phone on Tuesday afternoon, according to the article.\n\nWhen the conversation turned to race and the events in Charlottesville, Bannon dodged questions about his role in cultivating the alt-right, according to the article. He also faulted Democrats for focusing on identity politics.\n\n\"The longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" he said. \"I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nKuttner said he was puzzled by the fact that Bannon would call an editor at a progressive magazine and \"assume that a possible convergence of views on China trade might somehow paper over the political and moral chasm on white nationalism.\"\n\n\"The question of whether the phone call was on or off the record never came up,\" he said. \"This is also puzzling, since Stephen K. Bannon is not exactly Bambi when it comes to dealing with the press. He's probably the most media-savvy person in America.\"\n\nThe Washington Post", "id": "9685857", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Steve Bannon calls supremacists 'clowns', contradicts

His version of Scaramucci's call to Lizza,\" Axios reporter Jonathan Swan said.\n\nLike Mr Scaramucci, Mr Bannon reportedly did not realise the conversation was on the record. \"Apparently Bannon never thought that the journalist might take his (very newsworthy) comments and turn them into a story,\" Swan reported.\n\nProspect said that Bannon had never specified that the interview was off the record. Mr Bannon has yet to comment on the report.\n\nDuring the interview, the senior White House adviser talked about the storm over Mr Trump's defensive response to deadly violence at a white supremacist rally in Virginia at the weekend.\n\nDonald Trump on Charlottesville: 'there is blame on both sides' 01:58\n\nFar from defending the president, Mr Bannon spoke with disdain about the white nationalist movement he helped cultivate as a former head of Breitbart.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism - it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\n\"These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\nHe also said the administration's focus should be on China.\n\n\"To me the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that,\" he said.\n\n\"If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover,\" he said.\n\nTrump's chief strategist Steve Bannon - in 90 seconds 01:33\n\nMr Bannon was dismissive of Mr Trump's vow to bring down \"fire and fury\" on North Korea if it continued to threaten the United States with missiles and nuclear weapons.\n\n\"There's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats], forget it,\" he said. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nAccording to the interview, Mr Bannon described his fight within the administration to take a harder line against China's trade practices, and not fall into the trap of hoping China would play the role of honest broker in restraining North Korea.\n\n\"We're at economic war with China,\" he said. \"It's in all their literature. They're not shy about saying what they're doing.\n\n\"One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path. On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow.\"\n\nOf his adversaries in the State Department, Treasury and Defence who want to enlist China's help, Mr Bannon said \"they're wetting themselves\" - and named Mr Trump's chief economic advisor Gary Cohn as one of his foes.\n\n\"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" he said. \"We're still fighting. There's Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.\n\n\"We gotta do this. The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy. Don't get me wrong.

Club", "uri": "avclub.com", "id": "1819"}, "url": "http://www.avclub.com/article/steve-bannon-calls-white-supremacists-clowns-inter-259573", "eventUri": "eng-3367630", "isDuplicate": false, "storyUri": "eng-3367630", "body": "White House chief strategist Steve Bannon hasn't done much press in the seven months (god, it hasn't even been a year) of the Trump presidency, preferring to stand back and admire the racist blaze -- which he's fanned since his Breitbart days -- now raging its way across the country. Why bother, really, when the president readily spouts white supremacist talking points and can dog whistle with the best of them? Many commentators and journalists have chalked up Bannon's reticence to his savviness, though ousted White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci did offer up an alternate theory for what Bannon was actually doing with his mouth. But a new interview in The American Prospect undermines one of those suppositions while bolstering the other.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with The American Prospect, it's a progressive publication that has released cover stories emblazoned with the words \"Resisting Trump\" and \"Containing Trump.\" So, at first glance, it looks more like the kind of publication Bannon would be trying to shut down than have a sitdown with. But the man slowly turning into a full-body scab did just that, reaching out to Prospect reporter Robert Kuttner to praise him on a recent piece about Trump and North Korea. Bannon was so eager to speak with Kuttner that he accepted a phone interview despite having requested a face-to-face meeting. In his excitement to gush about the article -- in which Kuttner wrote that \"In Kim, Trump has met his match. The risk of two arrogant fools blundering into a nuclear exchange is more serious than at any time since October 1962\" -- Bannon never asked to keep anything off the record.\n\nHaving apparently learned nothing from the Mooch, Bannon talked military and economic strategy with Kuttner, showing all the chumminess he might otherwise reserve for his white supremacist friends on D.W. Griffith movie night. Bannon bragged about his position in the Trump administration, saying his rivals in the State and Defense departments are \"wetting themselves,\" though he didn't reveal whether their anxiety was over being in his crosshairs; being on the brink of nuclear war; being a part of an administration with a record low approval rating; or just balking at the idea of taking a harder stance against China, which seems to be at the top of Bannon's list of enemies. The chief strategist waves off concerns over war with North Korea, telling Kuttner that \"there's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats], forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nThe race war he seemed to be gunning for all along also holds little interest for Bannon these days. \"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more,\" Bannon said. \"These guys are a collection of clowns.\" Instead, Bannon wants to take the fight to China. As he told Kuttner: \"To me, the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nBannon then outlined his plan for sanctions against China, without ever once asking the journalist he went to lengths to speak with to keep any of his comments off the record. Apparently, Bannon perceives China as such a huge threat -- presumably because there are even more people of color there -- that he's willing to bring the left and right together to impose tough trade sanctions.\n\nTraffic to the bombshell interview has been crashing the American Prospect site since it was published, but other sites have been tracking the reaction to it from Bannon's colleagues. Axios' Jonathan Swan spoke with some of Trump officials who say they didn't know about the interview, and neither did Bannon, who we have to remind you has up until this point been commended for avoiding the press. Trump hasn't weighed in on Bannon's comments, but as one of his colleagues told Swan, \"Since Steve apparently enjoys casually undermining U.S. national security, I'll put this in terms he'll understand: This is DEFCON 1-level bad.\"", "id": "9706513", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Steve Bannon calls white supremacists \"clowns\" in interview he didn't realize he was giving", "image": "http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/6408/73/16x9/1200.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "120", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "65774", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dog"}, "id": "304848", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}, "id": "310110", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare"}, {"label": {"eng": "Korean War"}, "id": "332780", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War"}, {"label": {"eng": "The American Prospect"}, "id": "350087", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Prospect"}, {"label": {"eng": "Equation"}, "id": "356039", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"}, {"label": {"eng": "D.

I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more.\"\n\nFollowing the Charlottesville incident, President Donald Trump came under fire for making some of the most widely panned remarks of his presidency.\n\nAfter initially blaming the violence on \"both sides,\" Trump condemned the racist movements on Monday. But during a Tuesday press conference at Trump Tower that was supposed to focus on infrastructure, Trump reverted to his earlier position, claiming that the \"alt-left\" was at least partially responsible for the violence as well and wondering whether the counterprotesters have any \"semblance of guilt.\"\n\nThe president also said that although \"you had some very bad people in that group,\" you \"also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.\"\n\nOther outlets were reporting Wednesday that Bannon was one of the lone top White House officials who was pleased with the president's wild Tuesday press conference. Axios reported Wednesday evening that Bannon was thrilled, telling friends and associates that \"globalists\" were freaking out over the comments. The chief strategist called the press conference a \"defining moment\" for Trump, one in which the president sided with \"his people,\" a source said.\n\n\"Steve was proud of how [Trump] stood up to the braying mob of reporters,\" the source told Axios.\n\nPrior to joining the White House and Trump's campaign, Bannon served as the chairman of Breitbart, the far-right news site that Bannon himself once called \"the platform of the alt-right,\" the movement that brought together white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and other fringe groups on the right.\n\nIn his interview with The Prospect, Bannon said he wants the Democrats to \"talk about racism every day.\"\n\n\"The longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" Bannon said. \"I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nBannon went on to tell the Daily Mail on Thursday morning that his interview with The Prospect was good for the White House because it \"drew fire away\" from the president.", "id": "9713965", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Steve Bannon calls white nationalists, neo-Nazis 'losers' and 'a collection of clowns'", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/59959c34f1a8502b008b59a5-1190-625/steve-bannon-calls-white-nationalists-neo-nazis-losers-and-a-collection-of-clowns.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}, "id": "303035", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}, "id": "303910", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}, "id": "304050", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}, "id": "304051", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trump Tower (New York City)"}, "id": "304759", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_(New_York_City)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "News conference"}, "id": "309070", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_conference"}, {"label": {"eng": "The American Prospect"}, "id": "350087", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Prospect"}, {"label": {"eng": "Identity politics"}, "id": "366725", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Economic nationalism"}, "id": "379906", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}, "id": "394340", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "396058", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vardar", "label": {"eng": "Vardar"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethnic nationalism"}, "id": "518051", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Kuttner"}, "id": "743029", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kuttner"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alt-right"}, "id": "1268917", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 405, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations"}], "time": "14:50:00"}

He also talked about purging his rivals from the Defence and State departments.\n\nMr. Bannon is also asked about the white supremacist movement, whose march on Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend led to deadly violence. He dismisses them as \"losers,\" \"a fringe element\" and \"a collection of clowns.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"There's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats], forget it,\" Mr. Bannon says. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nMr. Trump tweeted earlier on Wednesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"made a very wise and well-reasoned decision\" by backing down after heightening fears of nuclear conflict in a series of combative threats, including against the US territory of Guam.\n\nMr. Bannon also outlined his push for the US to adopt a tougher stance on China trade, without waiting to see whether Beijing will help restrain Mr. Kim, as Mr. Trump has pressed China's leader to do. Mr. Trump also has lamented US trade deficits with China.\n\n\"The economic war with China is everything,\" Mr. Bannon says.\n\n\"And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nA Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said on Wednesday both sides have benefited from trade.\n\nAsked about Mr. Bannon's comments, Ms. Hua said at a regular new briefing, \"There is no winner in a trade war. We hope the relevant people can refrain from dealing with a problem in the 21st century with a zero-sum mentality from the 19th or the 20th century.\"\n\nMs. Hua appealed for dialogue to \"preserve the sound and steady growth of China-U.S. relations.\"\n\nMr. Bannon was a key general election campaign adviser and has been a forceful but contentious presence in a divided White House. A former leader of conservative Breitbart News, Mr. Bannon has drawn fire from some of Mr. Trump's closest advisers, including son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nThe President is under renewed pressure to fire Mr. Bannon, who has survived earlier rounds of having fallen out of favor with Mr. Trump.\n\nEarlier this week, the President passed up an opportunity to offer a public vote of confidence in Mr. Bannon. Mr. Trump said he's a \"good person\" and not a racist, adding that \"we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\"\n\nThe latest anti-Bannon campaign comes as Mr. Trump faces mounting criticism for

And we have to be maniacally focused on that,\" he said in the interview with the American Prospect, a left-leaning website.\n\n\"If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover,\" he said.\n\nBannon, an economic nationalist and former CEO of the extreme-right Breitbart news website, is reported to be on shaky ground with President Donald Trump, who gave him only a tepid endorsement this week.\n\nBut in a frank, freewheeling telephone interview with American Prospect editor Robert Kuttner, Bannon talked about the infighting in the White House, now engulfed in a storm over Trump's defensive response to deadly violence at a white supremacist rally in Virginia.\n\n'Collection of clowns'\n\nFar from defending Trump, Bannon spoke with disdain about the white nationalist movement he helped cultivate as a former head of Breitbart.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers.

They're not shy about saying what they're doing.\"\n\n\"One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path. On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow.\"\n\nOf his adversaries in the State Department and Defense who want to enlist China's help Bannon said \"they're wetting themselves.\"\n\n\"We gotta do this.

His comments came Wednesday while answering questions from reporters in New York City. (Aug. 15) AP\n\nAmid reports of disgust and dismay among White House officials in the wake of President Trump's insistence that \"both sides\" bear the blame for the violence that broke out in Charlottesville, Va.., Saturday, there appears to be one member of the administration who couldn't be happier: White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon.\n\nWhile others have decried Trump's remarks as a stain on the presidency, Bannon sees Tuesday's news conference as a \"defining moment\" in which Trump rejected the \"globalists\" and defended \"his people,\" according to a report from Axios.\n\nOne unnamed source told Axios that Bannon was \"proud\" that Trump \"stood up to the braying mob of reporters.\"\n\nAnd in a phone call to American Prospect co-founder and co-editor Robert Kuttner on Tuesday, Bannon seemed thrilled that Trump's opponents are talking so much about race.\n\nThe longer Democrats \"talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" Bannon said. \"I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nBannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart News who once called the site a \"platform for the alt-right,\" helped Trump form the nationalist message that cemented his base of support during the 2016 campaign.\n\nBut Bannon dismissed the white supremacists who demonstrated in Charlottesville as a \"bunch of clowns.\"\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers,\" Bannon told Kuttner. \"It's a fringe element, I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it.\"\n\nAnd Bannon did not seem concerned that Trump appeared to distance himself from him Tuesday. Rather, he said his rivals within the State and Defense departments are \"wetting themselves.\"\n\nBannon believes the U.S. is \"at economic war with China\" and many of those he views as adversaries wish to work with Beijing on trade and North Korea. He even called out some of those he wishes to see gone by name.\n\n\"I'm changing out people at East Asian Defense,\" Bannon said. \"I'm getting hawks in. I'm getting Susan Thornton out at State.\" Thorton is currently the acting head of East Asian and Pacific Affairs.\n\nBannon said he also is fighting Trump's national economic chair Gary Cohn and \"Goldman Sachs lobbying.\"\n\nBannon's strategy, according to Kuttner, \"is to battle the trade doves inside the administration while building an outside coalition of trade hawks that includes the left as well as right.\"\n\nKuttner believes Bannon reached out to him as part of this strategy. It was an effort to gain an ally from the left who shares some of his positions on China trade policy.\n\nKuttner said he found it \"puzzling\" that Bannon would \"assume that a possible convergence of views on China trade might somehow paper over the political and moral chasm on white nationalism.\"\n\n\"Either the reports of the threats to Bannon's job are grossly exaggerated and leaked by his rivals, or he has decided not to change his routine and to go down fighting,\" Kuttner concluded.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump distances himself from strategist Steve Bannon in wake of Charlottesville violence\n\nSteve Bannon is hurting Trump's agenda, says ex-aide Anthony Scaramucci\n\nBannon learned to harness troll army from 'World of Warcraft'\n\nSteve Bannon had portrait of himself as Napoleon, report says\n\nA look a White House chief strategist Steve Bannon Fullscreen Bannon and Kushner listen during a Cabinet meeting in the White House on June 12, 2017.

There's Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying,\" he said, name-dropping Trump's National Economic Council director.\n\nBannon, who as Trump's campaign chief who was widely credited with helping Trump cultivate support among the alt-right, also called that wing of the party \"losers,\" \"a fringe element,\" and a \"collection of clowns.\"\n\n\"I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more,\" he said, just days after Trump said \"two sides\" were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville.\n\nBannon, however, added that forcing Democrats to talk about race would ultimately benefit Trump's White House.\n\n\"If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats,\" he said.\n\nA White House official confirmed the accuracy of the quotes by Bannon in the \"American Prospect\" article but said Bannon intended to have a conversation about the writer's article on North Korea, rather than a full interview.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, published Wednesday, Bannon said that \"the race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" referring to the debates raging nationwide over Confederate monuments.\n\n\"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it,\" he said.\n\nHe also told the Daily Mail, in an article Thursday morning, that his earlier comments were designed to distract from Trump's own controversial comments about Charlottesville, explaining to the Daily Mail's website that his initial interview \"drew fire away from POTUS,\" and \"changed the [media] narrative.\"\n\nBannon's original comments, however, clearly ruffled feathers at the State Department.\n\nFollowing Bannon's attack on one of Rex Tillerson's most trusted career State Department employees, the secretary of state pointedly walked over to publicly shake Thornton's hand before sitting down to meet with Japanese officials on Thursday.\n\n\"The Secretary asked Susan Thornton to lead in a very important role and he continues to rely on her to lead the State Department's diplomacy in Asia,\" a State Department official said. \"We refer you to the White House for any additional questions.\"\n\nThough he has survived a number of these episodes in the past, Bannon's status within the White House has remained unclear in recent weeks.\n\nFollowing the abrupt departures in July of Sean Spicer, Reince Priebus and Anthony Scaramucci, sources inside and outside the White House indicated Bannon's future seemed tenuous.\n\nAfter Trump's explosive response this week to the violence in Charlottesville, multiple members of his Manufacturing Council quit, too, before the president disbanded it as well as another key economic council.\n\nAt a Tuesday press conference where he doubled down on his Charlottesville remarks, Trump offered ambiguous words about Bannon when asked about his adviser's future in the West Wing.\n\n\"We'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon,\" he said.\n\nIt sounded ominous -- but Bannon appeared unconcerned.\n\nTwo sources close to him told NBC News this week he seemed confident he'll survive this latest round of bruising headlines questioning his political future with the president.\n\n\"He should go,\" said King, who accused Bannon of \"exploiting a racial issue\" and \"undercutting\" Trump and Tillerson. \"I think it's important for the president to fire Steve Bannon,\" he said.\n\nIn the past, Bannon has expressed quiet certainty when his job was thought to be on the line.\n\nIn February, after a Time magazine cover story that dubbed Bannon \"The Great Manipulator\" irritated Trump, Bannon quietly hunkered down and avoided media attention.\n\nThen, in April, following his removal from the National Security Council, Bannon, instead of leaving, dug in against a storm of bad press suggesting he was on his way out.\n\nBy July, several White House advisers had told Politico that Bannon, once the chief architect of Trump's campaign and agenda, had put himself in a \"self-imposed exile\" to enhance his prospects for West Wing longevity.\n\nTrump for his part, had made his displeasure with Bannon known in April, hitting back at his strategist in a pair of interviews.\n\n\"You have to remember he was not involved in my campaign until very late,\" Trump told the New York Post, downplaying Bannon's role as chief architect of his campaign victory. \"I had already beaten all the senators and all the governors, and I didn't know Steve. I'm my own strategist and it wasn't like I was going to change strategies because I was facing crooked Hillary.\"\n\nTrump also slammed Bannon in an interview with The Wall Street Journal as \"a guy who works for me.\"\n\nFollowing those interviews, a source close to the president described Trump's comments as a \"warning shot,\" highlighting that the president \"doesn't say these things in haste.\"\n\nThis time, however, the White House refused to even hint at condemning Bannon's remarks.\n\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walter told NBC News on Thursday that \"Bannon's comments stand on their own.\"", "id": "9790614", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Steve Bannon feels secure amid White House infighting after Charlottesville", "image":

If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\n\nTrump has enlisted Chinese President Xi Jinping in the U.S. effort to curb North Korean leader Kim Jong Un from turning his country into the world's ninth full-fledged nuclear power. But at the same time, Trump has chafed at the U.S.'s chronic trade deficit with Beijing, $347 billion last year and accumulating at a similar pace this year. This week Trump directed U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to investigate whether China is stealing U.S. intellectual property, even as Beijing said both countries would end up being losers in any ensuing trade war.\n\nPushes 'America first'\n\nThe combative Bannon said he has to battle other White House aides every day to advance his no-holds-barred \"America first\" trade views against Trump aides who tend to favor existing efforts that emphasize multi-national trading cooperation.\n\nBannon joined Trump's White House staff after leading the conservative Breitbart News operation, which he once described as \"the platform for the alt-right\" nationalistic views. But he has often clashed inside the White House with aides with more moderate views, including Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n\nIn the interview, Bannon dismissed the importance in the U.S. of the politically far right.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalisn - it's losers,\" Bannon said. \"It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more.\n\nTrump this week has drawn widespread attacks for saying that white supremacists and counter-protesters share the blame for the violence that erupted at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing one and injuring 19 others.\n\nSome Trump supporters have called for the president to fire Bannon. Whether Trump still values Bannon's advice is uncertain.\n\nAt a news conference earlier this week, Trump passed up a chance to offer Bannon a public vote of confidence, saying he's a \"good person\"

If he's not fired, he's bulletproof,\" Washington Post contributor Daniel Drezner tweeted.\n\nDo we think Bannon pulled a Scaramucci (i.e. accidentally blurted stuff not knowing rules) or was this deliberate? https://t.co/9TJDZocbBx -- Jeet Heer (@HeerJeet)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\n\"Just read the Bannon interview with the Prospect. It's truly extraordinary. His version of Scaramucci's call to Lizza,\" Axios reporter Jonathan Swan said.\n\nLike Mr Scaramucci, Mr Bannon reportedly did not realise the conversation was on the record. \"Apparently Bannon never thought that the journalist might take his (very newsworthy) comments and turn them into a story,\" Swan reported.\n\nProspect said that Bannon had never specified that the interview was off the record. Mr Bannon has yet to comment on the report.\n\nDuring the interview, the senior White House adviser talked about the storm over Mr Trump's defensive response to deadly violence at a white supremacist rally in Virginia at the weekend.\n\nFar from defending the president, Mr Bannon spoke with disdain about the white nationalist movement he helped cultivate as a former head of Breitbart.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism - it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\n\"These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\nHe also said the administration's focus should be on China.\n\n\"To me the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that,\" he said.\n\n\"If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover,\" he said.\n\nMr Bannon was dismissive of Mr Trump's vow to bring down \"fire and fury\" on North Korea if it continued to threaten the United States with missiles and nuclear weapons.\n\n\"There's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats], forget it,\" he said. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nAccording to the interview, Mr Bannon described his fight within the administration to take a harder line against China's trade practices, and not fall into the trap of hoping China would play the role of honest broker in restraining North Korea.\n\n\"We're at economic war with China,\" he said. \"It's in all their literature. They're not shy about saying what they're doing.\n\nIn his own words | Steve Bannon\n\n\"One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path. On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow.\"\n\nOf his adversaries in the State Department, Treasury and Defence who want to enlist China's help, Mr Bannon said \"they're wetting themselves\" - and named Mr Trump's chief economic advisor Gary Cohn as one of his foes.\n\n\"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" he said. \"We're still fighting. There's Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.\n\n\"We gotta do this. The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy. Don't get me wrong.

But at the same time, Trump has chafed at the U.S.'s chronic trade deficit with Beijing, $347 billion last year and accumulating at a similar pace this year.

The argument of the article, entitled U.S. vs. North Korea: The Winner? China, had impressed Bannon. \"You absolutely nailed it,\" Bannon said.\n\n\"We're at economic war with China,\" Bannon continued. \"It's in all their literature. They're not shy about saying what they're doing. One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path. On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow.\"\n\nKuttner goes on to relate Bannon's description of \"his battle inside the administration to take a harder line on China trade, and not to fall into a trap of wishful thinking in which complaints against China's trade practices now had to take a backseat to the hope that China, as honest broker, would help restrain [North Korea's Kim Jong-un].\"\n\n\"To me,\" Bannon confessed, \"the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that.\"\n\nKuttner explained how Bannon's vision of the necessary Trump strategy will be to file \"a complaint under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act against Chinese coercion of technology transfers from American corporations\" and that official objections to steel and aluminum dumping would follow. \"We're going to run the tables on these guys,\" Bannon explained. \"We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us.\"\n\nRemarking on internal tensions, Bannon said his rivals in the White House and elsewhere in government \"were wetting themselves\" over North Korean tensions, but he assured Kuttner that opponents of his plan to target China economically were actively being marginalized.\n\nBannon told Kuttner that Trump wants to proceed, calling it his \"default position,\" but that \"trade doves\" inside the White House were stalling the effort. In fact, the reaching out to Kuttner becomes central to the story at this point, as Bannon apparently perceives potential allies in left-wing critics of the trade policies preferred by corporate elites -- the same kind of people who Bannon derisively terms \"globalists.\" Kuttner dismissed that idea as naive, calling it a \"puzzling\" leap to think \"possible convergence of views on China trade might somehow paper over the political and moral chasm\" of the white nationalism Bannon represents and has championed.\n\nOf the white supremacists who marched in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend, Bannon dismissed any responsibility he had for cultivating or making space for such movements and dismissed the participants as \"losers,\" \"a fringe element,\" and \"a collection of clowns.\" On the other hand, and according to separate reporting by Swan Wednesday night, Bannon is among those in the White House standing in approval of Trump's performance at Tuesday press conference, seeing it \"not as the lowest point in his presidency, but as a 'defining moment,' where Trump decided to fully abandon the 'globalists' and side with 'his people.'\"\n\nBut Bannon in his remarks to Kuttner also seemingly played his hand on the Democratic Party's response to the rise of Trump's brand of politics built around xenophobia, discrimination, and attacks on political correctness. \"The longer [the Democrats] talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" Bannon said. \"I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nThe next step for Bannon and Kuttner's relationship? Kuttner said he received an invitation to come to the White House after Labor Day to discuss these issues further.\n\nIf, of course, as Kuttner quipped, Bannon's \"still there.\"", "id": "9747452",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nStory highlightsSteve Bannon told the American Prospect, 'We're at economic war with China'The comments come as the chief White House strategist is under scrutiny\n\n(CNN)Embattled White House chief strategist Steve Bannon declared in an interview published Wednesday that the US is at \"economic war with China,\" promised aggressive trade actions against Beijing and said he is \"fighting\" other top White House aides \"every day.\"\n\nBannon also dismisses the ratcheting up of tensions stemming from North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile activity as \"just a sideshow\" and argues there is \"no military solution\" to the growing crisis, despite President Donald Trump's promises of \"fire and fury\" if North Korea continues to threaten or tries to target the US and its allies.The startlingly candid comments, which were published Wednesday in an interview with The American Prospect, a progressive publication, come as Bannon's future inside the West Wing appears uncertain. Bannon's rivals inside the White House and some of the President's outside advisers, including reportedly the conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch, have urged the President to fire Bannon -- and the President on Tuesday declined to publicly offer Bannon any assurances on his fate. Bannon and the White House did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment.Read More\"We're at economic war with China,\" Bannon told the Prospect. \"One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years, and it's gonna be them if we go down this path. On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow.\"Bannon added that \"the economic war with China is everything,\" arguing the US needs to be \"maniacally focused on that.\"\"If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover,\" Bannon said.The President's chief strategist, who has taken on an expansive portfolio from trade issues to the US's foreign wars and US manufacturing, also laid out his plans for the Trump administration to take a harder line against China on trade, explaining that the President's memorandum Monday that lays the groundwork for an investigation of Chinese trade practices is just a first step.\"We're going to run the tables on these guys,\" Bannon promised in the interview, explaining that the administration also plans to lodge trade complaints against China over steel and aluminum dumping.But Bannon also described his work to push this hardline trade agenda as a daily struggle that pits him against other top advisers to the President, including the National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn.\"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" Bannon said. \"We're still fighting. There's Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.\"Bannon also accused his rivals inside the administration who have urged restraint on trade of \"wetting themselves\" over the issue.He went on to articulate how he is reshuffling the US's foreign policy apparatus, explaining that he is seeking the ouster of the Acting Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs at the State Department and \"getting hawks in.\"The comments about his colleagues could place Bannon in a more precarious position inside the White House, whose staff is now being led by retired Gen. John Kelly.Bannon's comments come just two weeks after White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci was fired after he badmouthed colleagues in vulgar terms in a conversation with The New

I've followed your writing for years, and I think you and I are in the same boat when it comes to China. You absolutely nailed it.' \"\n\nThe story gets stranger from there: Bannon told Kuttner that he was champing for a trade war with China, which he believed would benefit from a nuclear standoff between North Korea and the U.S., and hoped that he could persuade left-wing activists to come on board. He undermined the administration's foreign policy strategy by saying that \"there's no military solution\" to the North Korean crisis where \"10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons.\" And he described in candid terms his clashes with colleagues (\"They're wetting themselves,\" he said) over what he sees as an existential economic battle with China. \"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" he said. \"We're still fighting. There's Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.\"\n\nHe notably disavowed the same racists and anti-Semites who had flocked to the news organization he used to run, Breitbart, which he had once described as a \"platform for the alt-right.\" \"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more,\" he told Kuttner. \"These guys are a collection of clowns.\" He also expressed the hope that the Democrats would continue to talk about race, a hot topic after a recent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville turned deadly. \"The longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day,\" said Bannon, who himself said that he disavowed the white supremacists. \"If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nThe bizarre interview immediately recalled a similarly free-wheeling, if more vulgar, interview that Anthony Scaramucci gave to The New Yorker, hastening the end of his brief, 10-day tenure as White House communications director. But whereas Scaramucci, a political neophyte, could perhaps be forgiven for his miscalculation, Bannon's call confused even the Prospect. \"The question of whether the phone call was on or off the record never came up,\" wrote Kuttner, wondering why Bannon would forget such a crucial thing. \"He's probably the most media-savvy person in America.\" Axios's Jonathan Swan reported that Bannon claims he thought his comments were off-the-record, but the White House, which already believes the former Breitbart chairman was leaking damaging information about his colleagues to the press, is clearly not buying them. A White House adviser normally on collegial terms with Bannon told Swan: \"Since Steve apparently enjoys casually undermining U.S. national security, I'll put this in terms he'll understand: This is DEFCON 1-level bad.\"\n\nThe press and Bannon's acolytes, who pore over covert photos of his office whiteboard like screenshots from Game of Thrones trailers, had no idea what to make of this one. And in the absence of real information, the theorizing began: was this Bannon playing three-dimensional chess, or did he make a fatal error? \"I could see Bannon thinking he was talking to a China ally & being loose / excited,\" tweeted Swan, while others insisted that there was a method to Bannon's madness. \"Bannon did this interview to draw fire away from POTUS [and his Charlottesville comments] and it's working,\" tweeted Mike Cernovich, an Internet personality and Bannon sympathizer who drove a campaign to fire H.R. McMaster that Bannon got blamed for. Perhaps, speculated Yahoo's Daniel Roberts, this was Bannon sending a message to the White House and Trump:\n\nBannon later told the Daily Mail that the interview was a positive, that it \"drew fire away from POTUS\" and that he \"changed the [media] narrative.\" Swan responded on Twitter that the \"effect is possibly true, but Bannon is post rationalizing.\" He said Bannon had \"told friends he didn't know he was being interviewed [and] didn't expect to be quoted.\"\n\nThere may, however, be a simpler answer to those well-versed in Bannonology: that the anti-establishment, apocalyptic right-wing prophet simply does not care what happens to him, and is preparing to go out in a blaze of glory. He may be more powerful -- and better able to sow chaos -- from outside the White House, anyway.", "id": "9770098", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Steve Bannon Goes Full Mooch in

Outraged over Trump's insistence that \"both sides\" were to blame for the violence that erupted during a white nationalist rally, leaving one woman dead, human rights activists demanded that the president fire so-called nationalists working in the West Wing. That group of hard-right populists in the White House is led by Bannon.\n\nOn Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York, Trump refused to guarantee Bannon's job security but defended him as \"not a racist\" and \"a friend.\" \"We'll see what happens with Mr Bannon,\" he said.\n\nIn the American Prospect article, titled \"Steve Bannon, Unrepentant,\" the president's strategist appears eager to lash out at his ideological rivals in the administration, bragging about his ability to defeat those who oppose a more aggressive posture toward China on trade policy.\n\n\"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" Bannon said. \"We're still fighting.

Bannon, President Donald Trump's polarizing and already embattled chief strategist, trashing associates and policies on North Korea and China - to a liberal writer, no less.\n\nThis dish isn't quite as wild as last month's phone call from Anthony Scaramucci to a New Yorker reporter. That one cost Scaramucci his job 10 days in for its combination of profanity, allusions to sex acts and backstabbing.\n\nStill, Bannon knew that history when he decided to unload his opinions to the liberal co-editor of the American Prospect, Robert Kuttner, whom he had never met.\n\nHe is either very confident in his job status or wants to get a few things off his chest before seeing the exit.\n\nBannon spoke openly about dispatching rivals in the administration, including in the Defense and State departments, who oppose his drive to confront China on trade. \"They're wetting themselves,\" he added.\n\nAnd he flatly contradicted Trump's strategy of tough talk in the face of North Korea's nuclear threat: \"There's no military solution, forget it.\"\n\n\"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, \" Bannon said. \"There's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nTrump has all but declared victory after Kim Jong Un tamped down his threats to attack Guam this week.\n\nBecause there's no solution to the North Korea problem, the White House should stop worrying about getting China's help on that issue and go hard against Chinese trade, Bannon said, pushing an issue that has been top priority for him.\n\nThe U.S. and China are in an \"economic war,\" Bannon said, adding that \"one of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years, and it's gonna be them if we go down this path\" of not confronting the Chinese over trade.\n\nSuch a sharp public contradiction on an important and volatile issue like Korea is startling for a top aide who expects to keep his job. Indeed, Trump failed to give Bannon a vote of confidence on Tuesday, saying \"we'll see\" when asked if Bannon would stay at the White House.\n\nThat lack of a strong endorsement added more intrigue to the American Prospect article.\n\nSo was he on the record? Some allies have suggested that Bannon did not think he was. But Kuttner seemed to anticipate those arguments, saying that the question never came up in their phone call. Like most reporters, he therefore considered it on the record.\n\nBannon is, after all, a former news chief.\n\n\"Steve Bannon is not exactly Bambi when it comes to dealing with the press,\" Kuttner wrote. \"He's probably the most media-savvy person in America.\"", "id": "9816349", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Embattled Bannon causes storm with comments to liberal writer (PHOTO)", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.rep-am.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20170817-223639-pic-46649962.jpg?fit=1000%2C754&w=640", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Guam"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "91", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam", "label": {"eng": "Guam"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "120", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": null, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Korea"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "65773", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Korea"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "65774", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "235649", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Politics"}, "id": "302948", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}, "id": "303483", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"}, {"label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "id": "303819", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Journalist"}, "id": "304358", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}, "id": "305377", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}, "id": "310256", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kim Jong-un"}, "id": "312664", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hegemony"}, "id": "317584", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony"}, {"label": {"eng": "The American Prospect"}, "id": "350087", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Prospect"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Kuttner"}, "id": "743029", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kuttner"}, {"label": {"eng": "Stephen Bannon"}, "id": "1268899", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Bannon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Anthony Scaramucci"}, "id": "1280341", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Scaramucci"}], "location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 492, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism"}], "time": "03:36:00"}

I want them to talk about racism every day,\" Bannon told The American Prospect. \"If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nBannon has since claimed that he didn't know the interview was on the record.\n\nBannon has been on thin ice for weeks and Trump was evasive when asked on Tuesday about Bannon's job security.\n\n\"Well, we'll see,\" Trump said. \"I like Mr. Bannon. He's a friend of mine, but Mr. Bannon came on very late-you know that. I went through 17 senators, governors, and I won all the primaries. Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that.\"\n\nBannon's delicate position within the White House is in part because Trump has suspected his aide of leaking internal White House drama to reporters, Axios reported last week.\n\nTrump was also upset that a new book out credited Bannon with orchestrating Trump's electoral victory, TheDC's Alex Pfeiffer reported last week.", "id": "9788738", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "GOP Rep To Trump: Bannon Needs To Go [VIDEO]", "image": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-17-at-6.12.47-PM-e1503008179582.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "218049", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}, "id": "302944", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}, "id": "304050", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Journalist"}, "id": "304358", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist"}, {"label": {"eng": "Primary election"}, "id": "304973", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}, "id": "305377", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Talk radio"}, "id": "306009", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_radio"}, {"label": {"eng": "WABC (AM)"}, "id": "334957", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WABC_(AM)"}, {"label": {"eng": "WNBC"}, "id": "343490", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Identity (social science)"}, "id": "347189", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"}, {"label": {"eng": "The American Prospect"}, "id": "350087", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Prospect"}, {"label": {"eng": "Identity politics"}, "id": "366725", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Economic nationalism"}, "id": "379906", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_nationalism"}, {"location": null, "score": 1, "id": "396058", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vardar", "label": {"eng": "Vardar"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Peter T.

There's Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.\"\n\nBannon also accused his rivals inside the administration who have urged restraint on trade of \"wetting themselves\" over the issue.\n\nHe went on to articulate how he is reshuffling the US's foreign policy apparatus, explaining that he is seeking the ouster of the Acting Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs at the State Department and \"getting hawks in.\"\n\nThe comments about his colleagues could place Bannon in a more precarious position inside the White House, whose staff is now being led by retired Gen. John Kelly.\n\nBannon's comments come just two weeks after White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci was fired after he badmouthed colleagues in vulgar terms in a conversation with The

This is known as a Section 301 investigation, permitted under the 1974 Trade Act.\n\nFollowing this investigation, the Trump administration could impose tariffs on Chinese imports, rescind licenses, or take other action.\n\nBannon, in the American Prospect interview, seemed to say that an investigation of China is not necessary, and Trump should impose sanctions on Beijing immediately.\n\n\"We're going to run the tables on these guys,\" Bannon said of China. \"We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war, and they're crushing us.\"\n\nBannon said that he's trying to act against officials in the State, Defense, and Treasury Departments who don't agree with his views.\n\n\"Oh, they're wetting themselves,\" he said of his opponents in government. \"I'm changing out people at East Asian Defense; I'm getting hawks in.

One woman was killed and several of her fellow counter-protesters were injured when a car plowed through a crowd. In the days following the incident, President Donald Trump made a series of remarks -- some off the cuff -- that were strongly rebuked by politicians from both sides of the aisle.\n\nThe former editor of the far-right news website Breitbart is a controversial figure within the White House.\n\nA source close to Bannon told CNN he did not believe he was being interviewed when he spoke with the co-founder and co-editor of the American Prospect earlier this week.\n\n\"It was no interview,\" the source said.\n\nBannon and the White House did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nEarlier this week, Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Florida, named Bannon and Stephen Miller as individuals he thought were trying to accommodate the alt-right or white nationalists from within the West Wing, and advised the President to stop listening to them.\n\nBut Bannon's comments to the Prospect pushed back on that notion.\n\n\"It's a fringe element,\" Bannon told the magazine's co-founder Robert Kuttner about white nationalists within Trump's base. \"I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more.\"\n\nHe added: \"These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\nKuttner wrote that Bannon never asked for his remarks to be off the record.\n\n\"The question of whether the phone call was on or off the record never came up. This is also puzzling, since Steve Bannon is not exactly Bambi when it comes to dealing with the press.

At one point, he even got candid about how he's going up against people like Gary Cohn:\n\nBut what about his internal adversaries, at the departments of State and Defense, who think the United States can enlist Beijing's aid on the North Korean standoff, and at Treasury and the National Economic Council who don't want to mess with the trading system?\n\n\"Oh, they're wetting themselves,\" he said, explaining that the Section 301 complaint, which was put on hold when the war of threats with North Korea broke out, was shelved only temporarily, and will be revived in three weeks. As for other cabinet departments, Bannon has big plans to marginalize their influence.\n\n\"I'm changing out people at East Asian Defense; I'm getting hawks in. I'm getting Susan Thornton [acting head of East Asian and Pacific Affairs] out at State.\"\n\nBut can Bannon really win that fight internally?\n\n\"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" he said. \"We're still fighting. There's Treasury and [National Economic Council chair] Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.\"\n\nOn North Korea, Bannon also said, \"There's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats], forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nHowever, with Charlottesville still a bit part of the national discussion, Bannon has been in the spotlight recently for other reasons. Bannon's association with the alt-right has led to renewed calls for him to be fired, especially after the events of Charlottesville.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nStory highlightsSome sources say Steve Bannon intentionally spoke to the American ProspectThe remarkable comments were reminiscent of what got Bannon into hot water earlier this year\n\nBridgewater, New Jersey (CNN)White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is privately offering shifting and conflicting explanations for the strikingly candid interview that could further imperil his already shaky standing inside the West Wing.\n\nSources close to Bannon first said the chief strategist did not know he was being interviewed when he spoke over the phone with Robert Kuttner, the co-editor of The American Prospect. But the same sources now say the chief strategist granted the interview as part of a ploy to distract from the criticism President Donald Trump has been facing over his response to the violence in Charlottesville sparked by a white supremacist rally.\"Bannon knew full well this would distract from criticism,\" a source familiar with Bannon's thinking said.Bannon says US locked in 'economic war' with China, slams White House colleaguesA second source familiar with Bannon's thinking said the chief strategist was trying \"to divert attention from Charlottesville criticism\" by offering the controversial comments to the American Prospect reporter, knowing the comments would grip headlines.Read MoreBannon has declined to comment and did not respond to CNN's inquiry asking about the conflicting accounts.Bannon's remarks may have served to momentarily divert attention from the President's controversial response to the violence in Charlottesville, but his comments also offered damaging insight into the divisions inside the Trump administration and showed the chief strategist undercutting the President on the most significant national security issue facing the administration.While Trump promised to rain \"fire and fury\" on North Korea should the rogue regime continue to threaten or attempt to strike the US or its allies, Bannon dismissed North Korea as a \"sideshow\" to the larger economic conflicts between the US and China and argued there is \"no military solution\" to the crisis.The remarkable comments were reminiscent of what got Bannon into hot water earlier this year, when a narrative began to set in that he was effectively running the White House.Bannon also offered unprompted criticism of fellow advisers to the president, including National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, whom Bannon placed among those he is fighting \"every day\" to push a harder line on international trade issues.Those comments in particular could land Bannon in trouble with the President and his recently-installed chief of staff John Kelly, who just two weeks earlier ousted White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci after he badmouthed colleagues in vulgar terms to The New Yorker.Scaramucci later said he did not believe his conversation with The New Yorker reporter had been on the record, and later conceded he made a mistake.Robert Kuttner, the Prospect editor who interviewed Bannon on Tuesday, wrote in his article that \"the question of whether the phone call was on or off the record never came up.\"President Donald Trump on Steve Bannon's future: 'We'll see'\"This is also puzzling, since Steve Bannon is not exactly Bambi when it comes to dealing with the press. He's probably the most media-savvy person in America,\" Kuttner wrote.Bannon, the former Breitbart chief, is known for being particular media savvy and -- like other experienced Washington hands -- knows that all conversations with reporters are on the record unless an agreement is reached beforehand.", "id": "9740586", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Bannon's interview: Blunder

The interview started with Bannon countering Trump's language on bringing \"fire and fury\" against Kim Jong Un's regime, asserting, \"There's no military solution [to the North Korean threat], forget it.\" Bannon continued, \"Until someone solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about. There's no military solution here. They got us.\"\n\nBut the conversation quickly pivoted to the hot-button issue of Charlottesville. Bannon commended Trump's handling of the press, and then went further in an effort to distance himself from his own Breitbart/alt-right associations. \"Ethno-nationalism,\" he said, \"it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much ... and we gotta help crush it.\" He continued, \"These guys [white supremacists] are a collection of clowns.\" Well, they're some of the same folks he declared Breitbart a \"platform\" for when he ran the news website.\n\nThis interview was an unusual decision for Bannon, who is wildly known to be quite hostile to the media and rarely grants interviews. In fact, it has been reported that Bannon was unaware that his statements were on the record. That suggestion is laughable, as Bannon is media savvy enough to know better -- especially less than a month after the Anthony Scaramucci blowup. In all likelihood this was an intentional play by Bannon, who has reportedly become increasingly isolated within the administration. Indeed, the Beltway rumor mill and 24/7 media talkingheads want us to believe his job is on the line. This may be plausible, due to news of much frustration among the White House staff over Trump's press conferences on Charlottesville, but it's hard to say. Bannon seems to be one of the few who was genuinely excited for Trump's response to the riot and called it a \"defining moment.\" He \"was proud of how [Trump] stood up to the braying mob of reporters.\"\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Trump sticks with Bannon, or if he chooses to cut him loose amidst all the mainstream media blow-back this week.", "id": "9770154", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Bannon on Thin Ice?", "image": "https://cached-assets.patriotpost.us/images/2017-08-17-ab48a196.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "120", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "65774", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}, "id": "303035", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kim Jong-un"}, "id": "312664", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un"}, {"label": {"eng": "The American Prospect"}, "id": "350087", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Prospect"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alt-right"}, "id": "1268917", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right"}, {"label": {"eng": "Anthony Scaramucci"}, "id": "1280341", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Scaramucci"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 291, "label": "dmoz/News/Media", "uri": "dmoz/News/Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 292, "label": "dmoz/News/Media/Services", "uri": "dmoz/News/Media/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 465, "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 788, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1087, "label": "dmoz/Computers/History", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/History"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1088, "label": "dmoz/Computers/History/Pioneers", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/History/Pioneers"}], "time": "20:04:00"}

We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us,\" said Bannon who once headed the right-wing Breitbart News.\n\nCommenting on his remarks, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying in Beijing warned that \"there is no winner in a trade war\" and appealed for dialogue.\n\n\"We hope the relevant people can refrain from dealing with a problem in the 21st century with a zero-sum mentality from the 19th or the 20th century,\" she said.\n\nIn his interview over phone, Bannon argued that there was no military solution to North Korean provocative behaviour.\n\n\"There's no military solution (to North Korea's nuclear threats), forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us,\" Bannon said.\n\nOn Monday, Trump signed an executive order asking the US Trade Representative for examination of Chinese policies, practices, and actions with regard to the forced transfers of US technology and the theft of its intellectual property.\n\n\"The theft of intellectual property by foreign countries costs our nation millions of jobs and billions and billions of dollars each and every year. For too long, this wealth has been drained from our country while Washington has done nothing,\" Trump said.\n\nIn the interview, Bannon said that he is getting hawks placed at key position. At the same time he acknowledged that he is getting opposition from various section.\n\n\"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" he said.\n\n\"We're still fighting. There's Treasury and [National Economic Council chair] Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying,\" he added. \"We gotta do this. The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy. Don't get me wrong. It's like, every day,\" Bannon said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "id": "9742197", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump's close aide says US at economic war with China", "image": "http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/common/no_preview.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "120", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "65436", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "65774", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}, "id": "302593", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}, "id": "304969", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying"}, {"label": {"eng": "21st century"}, "id": "308563", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_century"}, {"label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}, "id": "311241", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade war"}, "id": "313694", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_war"}, {"label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}, "id": "313700", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China"}, "id": "324130", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hua Chunying"}, "id": "324132", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hua_Chunying"}, {"label": {"eng": "Executive order"}, "id": "324806", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order"}, {"label": {"eng": "The American Prospect"}, "id": "350087", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Prospect"}, {"label": {"eng": "Equation"}, "id": "356039", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Office of the United States Trade Representative"}, "id": "382533", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_United_States_Trade_Representative"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gary Cohn (comics)"}, "id": "397337", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cohn_(comics)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inflection point"}, "id": "410741", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection_point"}, {"label": {"eng": "Anglo-Irish Trade War"}, "id": "741881", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Trade_War"}, {"label": {"eng": "Breitbart News Network"}, "id": "1268862", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News_Network"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 271, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 286, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period", "uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic"}], "time": "17:16:00"}

In the aftermath of that interview, aides to the chief White House strategist told Axios Bannon -- who's been labeled a \"leaker\" by several current and former administration officials -- thought the call was off the record.\n\n\"This is DEFCON 1-level bad,\" one of Bannon's colleagues told Axios.\n\nNow, Bannon is reportedly thanking himself for that interview, telling the Daily Mail he \"drew fire away from POTUS\" and \"changed the [media] narrative\" from nonstop coverage of the president's Charlottesville response, albeit briefly.\n\nIn that interview with the American Prospect, Bannon appeared to undercut the White House position on North Korea, arguing \"there's no military solution\" to deal with the rogue nuclear power. He also called ehtno-nationalists \"losers,\" adding \"it's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it.\"\n\nBannon -- who was described as in \"high spritis\" during the call -- further insisted he's \"got\" Democrats as long as they talk about what he described as \"identity politics.\"\n\n\"The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" Bannon told the American Prospect. \"I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nBannon echoed that sentiment in a decidedly on-record interview with the New York Times, inviting the left to \"tear down more statues.\"\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon told the Times. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\nIt's unclear how the American Prospect interview writ large is playing with Trump, but at least one administration praised Bannon for his criticism of Democrats and ethno-nationlists.\n\n\"The president doesn't like all the Democrats' focus on racism, and it's good that Steve mocked it as politically stupid,\" an aide told the Daily Mail. \"Plus, distance from actual racists is a good thing.\"", "id": "9762962", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Bannon defends his freewheeling interview: It 'drew fire away from' Trump and 'changed the narrative'", "image": "https://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steve-bannon.jpg?w=640", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "120", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethnic group"}, "id": "303327", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"}, {"label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}, "id": "303936", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times"}, {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}, "id": "304050", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}, "id": "307492", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bigotry"}, "id": "310173", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flickr"}, "id": "315508", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flickr"}, {"label": {"eng": "Presidency of Bill Clinton"}, "id": "316872", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Bill_Clinton"}, {"label": {"eng": "DEFCON"}, "id": "336892", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFCON"}, {"label": {"eng": "The American Prospect"}, "id": "350087", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Prospect"}, {"location": null, "score": 4, "id": "361661", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Harbor,_Maryland", "label": {"eng": "National Harbor, Maryland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Identity politics"}, "id": "366725", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conservative Political Action Conference"}, "id": "368801", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Political_Action_Conference"}, {"label": {"eng": "Economic nationalism"}, "id": "379906", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_nationalism"}, {"location": null, "score": 4, "id": "396058", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vardar", "label": {"eng": "Vardar"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethnic nationalism"}, "id": "518051", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Kuttner"}, "id": "743029", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kuttner"}, {"label": {"eng": "Race (human categorization)"}, "id": "1083325", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 276, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 492, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 493, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 788, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/News_and_Media"}], "time": "12:58:00"}

I want them to talk about racism every day,' he boasted.\n\n'If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.'\n\nWhite House chief strategist Steve Bannon called a liberal magazine writer on Wednesday and dished to him about the North Korean standoff, an economic war in China and race politics\n\nAlong the way, he sought to distance himself from the white nationalists and other 'alt-right' denizens who have found an ideological bedfellow in Breitbart News, the website he led until last year.\n\n'Ethno-nationalism - it's losers,' he said. 'It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it.'\n\n'These guys are a collection of clowns,' he added.\n\nBannon's conversation with writer Robert Kuttner was reminiscent of fired White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci's infamous job-ending phone call to a New Yorker reporter - without The Mooch's four-letter-words.\n\nBannon and a key aide did not respond to a question on Wednesday evening about whether the Trump-whisperer thought he was speaking off the record.\n\nIf not, he purposely contradicted President Donald Trump's stated policy on North Korea, a saber-rattling warning to rain 'fire and fury' down on dictator Kim Jong-Un if he didn't back off an aggressive missile test-launch posture.\n\n'There's no military solution,' Bannon said Wednesday. 'Forget it.'\n\n'Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.'\n\nBannon also acknowledged a long-running internal feud with National Economic Council chair Gary Cohn over whether to impose trade sanctions on China.\n\nWhile Cohn and others argue for a softer line in the hope that Beijing will in return help keep North Korea in check, Bannon wants to acknowledge an existing all-out economic war between China and the United States.\n\n'We're at economic war with China,' he said. 'It's in all their literature. They're not shy about saying what they're doing. One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path.'\n\n'To me the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that,' Bannon added, warning of an 'inflection point' coming in the next decade beyond which the U.S. economy could be permanently sunk.\n\nCohn and some at the Treasury Department stand in his way.\n\n'Oh, they're wetting themselves,' Bannon said, explaining that he has plans to marginalize the influence of cabinet agencies and bureaucrats who oppose him.\n\n'We're still fighting. There's Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying,' he observed.\n\n'We gotta do this. The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy.'", "id": "9584547", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Bannon: Democrats' focus on race instead of the

We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us,\" said Bannon, who acknowledged he was battling trade doves within the U.S. administration.\n\nHe said there was no reason to go soft on China in order to get Beijing's support over North Korea because he believed China would do little more to rein in Pyongyang.\n\nBannon said he might consider a deal in which China got North Korea to freeze its nuclear build-up with verifiable inspections and the United States removed its troops from the Korean peninsula, but such a deal seemed remote, prospect.org reported.\n\nIn contrast to Trump's threat of \"fire and fury\" against North Korea, Bannon said: \"There\u00b4s no military solution, forget it.\"\n\n\"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don\u00b4t know what you\u00b4re talking about ...\"\n\nAsked about any connection between his economic nationalism and white nationalism in the United States, and in particular the racist violence in Charlottesville, Bannon said: \"Ethno-nationalism - it's losers. It's a fringe element.\"\n\n\"I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more. These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\nHowever, Bannon, who formerly led the right-wing website Breitbart, said focusing on race would help the Republicans politically.\n\n\"The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em.

They're not shy about saying what they're doing. One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\n\"If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nBannon said the United States would use Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act against Chinese coercion of technology transfers from U.S. corporations doing business in China and follow up with complaints against steel and aluminium dumping, according to prospect.org.\n\nOn Monday, Trump authorised an inquiry into China's alleged theft of intellectual property in the first direct trade measure by his administration against Beijing.\n\n\"We're going to run the tables on these guys. We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us,\" said Bannon, who acknowledged he was battling trade doves within the U.S. administration.\n\nHe said there was no reason to go soft on China in order to get Beijing's support over North Korea because he believed China would do little more to rein in Pyongyang.\n\nBannon said he might consider a deal in which China got North Korea to freeze its nuclear build-up with verifiable inspections and the United States removed its troops from the Korean peninsula, but such a deal seemed remote, prospect.org reported.\n\nIn contrast to Trump's threat of \"fire and fury\" against North Korea, Bannon said: \"There's no military solution, forget it.\"\n\n\"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about ...\"\n\nAsked about any connection between his economic nationalism and white nationalism in the United States, and in particular the racist violence in Charlottesville, Bannon said: \"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element.\"\n\n\"I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more. These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\nHowever, Bannon, who formerly led the right-wing website Breitbart, said focusing on race would help the Republicans politically.\n\n\"The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from

We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us,\" said Bannon who once headed the right-wing Breitbart News.\n\nCommenting on his remarks, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying in Beijing warned that \"there is no winner in a trade war\" and appealed for dialogue. \"We hope the relevant people can refrain from dealing with a problem in the 21st century with a zero-sum mentality from the 19th or the 20th century,\" she said.\n\nIn his interview over phone, Bannon argued that there was no military solution to North Korean provocative behaviour. \"There's no military solution (to North Korea's nuclear threats), forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us,\" Bannon said.\n\nOn Monday, Trump signed an executive order asking the US Trade Representative for examination of Chinese policies, practices, and actions with regard to the forced transfers of US technology and the theft of its intellectual property. \"The theft of intellectual property by foreign countries costs our nation millions of jobs and billions and billions of dollars each and every year. For too long, this wealth has been drained from our country while Washington has done nothing,\" Trump said.\n\nIn the interview, Bannon said that he is getting hawks placed at key position. At the same time he acknowledged that he is getting opposition from various section. \"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" he said.\n\n\"We're still fighting. There's Treasury and [National Economic Council chair] Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying,\" he added. \"We gotta do this. The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy. Don't get me wrong. It's like, every day,\" Bannon said.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: US China relations", "id": "9718397", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Donald Trump's close aide says US at economic war with China", "image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/us-china-759.jpg?w=759", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 33, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 48}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "120", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "65436", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "65774", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "21st century"}, "id": "308563", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_century"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade war"}, "id": "313694", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_war"}, {"label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}, "id": "313700", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China"}, "id": "324130", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hua Chunying"}, "id": "324132", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hua_Chunying"}, {"label": {"eng": "The American Prospect"}, "id": "350087", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Prospect"}, {"label": {"eng": "Equation"}, "id": "356039", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inflection point"}, "id": "410741", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection_point"}, {"label": {"eng": "Anglo-Irish Trade War"}, "id": "741881", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Trade_War"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 286, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period", "uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic"}], "time": "15:11:00"}

And we have to be maniacally focused on that,\" he said in the interview with the left-leaning website American Prospect. He also contradicted the president's position on North Korea, bad-mouthed his colleagues in the administration and mocked Trump officials who fear the consequences of radically changing trade policy, saying they are \"wetting themselves\". Mr Bannon criticised the white nationalist movement during the interview as well.\n\n\"If we continue to lose it -- we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover,\" he added. \"One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's going be them if we go down this path.\"\n\nPeople close to Mr Bannon said he believed the interview was part of an off-the-record conversation with Mr Robert Kuttner with The American Prospect that, according to the magazine, he initiated. Mr Kuttner said the issue of whether the call was on the record never came up.\n\nAsked about Mr Bannon's comments, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular news briefing that \"there is no winner in a trade war\".\n\n\"We hope the relevant people can refrain from dealing with a problem in the 21st century with a zero-sum mentality from the 19th or the 20th century,\" said Ms Hua, who also appealed for dialogue to \"preserve the sound and steady growth of China-US relations\".\n\nMr Bannon's comments came as Washington launches a probe into Beijing's theft of American technology and intellectual property in a move that could lead to steep tariffs on Chinese goods and a trade war.\n\nMr Bannon, an economic nationalist and former chief executive of the extreme-right Breitbart news website, is reported to be on shaky ground with President Donald Trump, who gave him only a tepid endorsement this week.\n\nBut, in the frank, freewheeling telephone interview with Mr Kuttner, Mr Bannon talked about the infighting in the White House, now engulfed in a storm over Mr Trump's defensive response to deadly violence at a white supremacist rally in Virginia.\n\nFar from defending Mr Trump, Mr Bannon spoke with disdain about the white nationalist movement he helped cultivate as a former Breitbart head. \"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we got to help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more,\" he was quoted as saying. \"These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\nMr Bannon also dismissed Mr Trump's vow to bring down \"fire and fury\" on North Korea if it continued to threaten the US with missiles and nuclear weapons. \"There's no military solution -- forget it,\" he said. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about. There's no military solution here -- they got us.\"\n\nAsked about Mr Bannon's comments on North Korea, the top US military officer, General Joseph Dunford, told reporters in Beijing yesterday that Mr Trump has \"told us to develop credible viable military options and that's exactly what we're doing\".\n\nIn addition, Mr Bannon spoke to Mr Kuttner about his long-simmering feud with some of Mr Trump's top economic advisers, adding that he battles them often, especially over his determination to take a tougher position on China.\n\n\"That's a fight I fight every day here,\" Mr Bannon is quoted as saying in the interview about his feuds with other senior officials over China.\n\nHe pointed to fellow Goldman Sachs alumni, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, who are pushing for a softer stance on trade with China.\n\n\"We're still fighting. There's Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying,\" Mr Bannon said.\n\nResponding to Mr Bannon's interview with the American Prospect, an article on The American Conservative website noted that he is either \"a genius, or he's reckless and crazy\".\n\n\"Or maybe he's both, but his recklessness outran his genius this one time. I can't see how he survives having talked so loosely to a journalist -- a liberal journalist at that -- about administration infighting and the White House's approach to North Korea and China,\" the article added.

But the same sources now say the chief strategist granted the interview as part of a ploy to distract from the criticism President Donald Trump has been facing over his response to the violence in Charlottesville sparked by a white supremacist rally.\n\n\"Bannon knew full well this would distract from criticism,\" a source familiar with Bannon's thinking said.\n\nA second source familiar with Bannon's thinking said the chief strategist was trying \"to divert attention from Charlottesville criticism\" by offering the controversial comments to the American Prospect reporter, knowing the comments would grip headlines.\n\nBannon has declined to comment and did not respond to CNN's inquiry asking about the conflicting accounts.\n\nBannon's remarks may have served to momentarily divert attention from the President's controversial response to the violence in Charlottesville, but his comments also offered damaging insight into the divisions inside the Trump administration and showed the chief strategist undercutting the President on the most significant national security issue facing the administration.\n\nWhile Trump promised to rain \"fire and fury\" on North Korea should the rogue regime continue to threaten or attempt to strike the US or its allies, Bannon dismissed North Korea as a \"sideshow\" to the larger economic conflicts between the US and China and argued there is \"no military solution\" to the crisis.\n\nThe remarkable comments were reminiscent of what got Bannon into hot water earlier this year, when a narrative began to set in that he was effectively running the White House.\n\nBannon also offered unprompted criticism of fellow advisers to the president, including National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, whom Bannon placed among those he is fighting \"every day\" to push a harder line on international trade issues.\n\nThose comments in particular could land Bannon in trouble with the President and his recently-installed chief of staff John Kelly, who just two weeks earlier ousted White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci after he badmouthed colleagues in vulgar terms to The New Yorker.\n\nScaramucci later said he did not believe his conversation with The New Yorker reporter had been on the record, and later conceded he made a mistake.\n\nRobert Kuttner, the Prospect editor who interviewed Bannon on Tuesday, wrote in his article that \"the question of whether the phone call was on or off the record never came up.\"\n\n\"This is also puzzling, since Steve Bannon is not exactly Bambi when it comes to dealing with the press.

If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover. We're going to run the tables on these guys. We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us.\"\n\nOn white supremacists\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more. These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\nOn North Korea\n\n\"There's no military solution, forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nOn race and Democrats\n\n\"The longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"", "id": "9738488", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Steve Bannon just

They're not shy about saying what they're doing. One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\n\"If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she had seen the report, and reiterated the essence of the China-U.S. trade relationship is mutually beneficial.\n\n\"In reality, China and the United States' long term cooperation has brought about real benefits for both countries' peoples, any unbiased person will clearly see this fact,\" she told a daily news briefing in Beijing.\n\n\"We have also said before, a trade war has no future. A trade war does not serve the interests of any party, as fighting a trade war will not produce a winner. We hope that relevant parties can stop viewing issues of the 21st century with a 19th- or 20th-century mentality.\"\n\nBannon said the United States would use Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act against Chinese coercion of technology transfers from U.S. corporations doing business in China and follow up with complaints against steel and aluminum dumping, according to prospect.org.\n\nOn Monday, Trump authorized an inquiry into China's alleged theft of intellectual property in the first direct trade measure by his administration against Beijing.\n\n\"We're going to run the tables on these guys. We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us,\" said Bannon, who acknowledged he was battling trade doves within the U.S. administration.\n\nHe said there was no reason to go soft on China in order to get Beijing's support over North Korea because he believed China would do little more to rein in Pyongyang.\n\nBannon said he might consider a deal in which China got North Korea to freeze its nuclear build-up with verifiable inspections and the United States removed its troops from the Korean peninsula, but such a deal seemed remote, prospect.org reported.\n\nIn contrast to Trump's threat of \"fire and fury\" against North Korea, Bannon said: \"There's no military solution, forget it.\"\n\n\"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about ...\"\n\nAsked about any connection between his economic nationalism and white nationalism in the United States, and in particular the racist violence in Charlottesville, Bannon said: \"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element.\"\n\n\"I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more. These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\nHowever, Bannon, who formerly led the right-wing website Breitbart, said focusing on race would help the Republicans politically.\n\n\"The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\n(Reporting by Michael Perry; Additional reporting by Christian Shepherd in BEIJING;

One woman was killed and several of her fellow counter-protesters were injured when a car plowed through a crowd. In the days following the incident, President Donald Trump made a series of remarks -- some off the cuff -- that were strongly rebuked by politicians from both sides of the aisle.\n\nThe former editor of the far-right news website Breitbart is a controversial figure within the White House.\n\nEarlier this week, Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Florida, named Bannon and Stephen Miller as individuals he thought were trying to accommodate the alt-right or white nationalists from within the West Wing, and advised the President to stop listening to them.\n\nBannon and the White House did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nBut Bannon's comments to the Prospect pushed back on that notion.\n\n\"It's a fringe element,\" Bannon told the magazine's co-founder Robert Kuttner about white nationalists within Trump's base. \"I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more.\"\n\nHe added: \"These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\nKuttner said that Bannon never asked for his remarks to be off the record.\n\n\"The question of whether the phone call was on or off the record never came up.

Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, not to mention a coalition of congressional Republicans and Democrats that included both conservative Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Vermont socialist Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nBut one voice was notably missing: that of Stephen K. Bannon, the White House chief political strategist who has been described as having a \"mind meld\" with the president, especially on issues of national identity, trade and immigration.\n\nRelated: Will Donald Trump fire Steve Bannon?\n\nSteve Bannon, Donald Trump's chief strategist, leaves the Rose Garden after the president announces his decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement at the White House in Washington, D.C., on June 1. Chip Somodevilla/Getty\n\nFrom Saturday afternoon until Tuesday evening, Newsweek sent more than a half-dozen requests for comment to Bannon, as well as to the White House press office and to two representatives of CapitalHQ, a publicity firm that reportedly represents Bannon. Those requests asked Bannon if he would condemn the violence in Charlottesville. Newsweek also asked how Bannon would describe his relationship to the groups that participated in Unite the Right.\n\nBannon did not respond to any of these queries. Nor did anyone else presumably authorized to speak on his behalf, suggesting that a media avoidance strategy was in the works.\n\nThe silence isn't surprising, since Bannon rarely talks (on the record) to the mainstream media, which he has described as an \"opposition party\" relative to the Trump administration. Many observers point to a seeming affinity between Bannon, a self-described \"economic nationalist\" who presided over far-right clearinghouse Breitbart News, and the extremists groups that descended on Charlottesville over the weekend to protest the removal of a Confederate statue.\n\nAfter chaos swept through that town, the hashtag #FireBannon trended on Twitter, as both liberals and establishment conservatives called for the rumpled nationalist to be expelled from the White House.\n\nOn Monday, The New York Times reported that Bannon's status was embattled. He had \"consulted with the president repeatedly over the weekend as Mr. Trump struggled to respond to the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. In general, Mr. Bannon has cautioned the president not to criticize far-right activists too severely for fear of antagonizing a small but energetic part of his base.\"\n\nIt was Bannon's influence, presumably, that led Trump to issue a tepid statement on Saturday afternoon, in which he said that \"many sides\" were responsible for the deaths and 19 injuries in Charlottesville. That statement was widely condemned, leading to a more forceful one on Monday, in which Trump more forcefully criticized Saturday's malefactors.\n\nAccording to the Times, whose Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush, widely considered the best-sourced reporters on the Trump administration, his reticence in speaking out on Charlottesville has led to \"new pressure from Mr. Trump's critics to dismiss Mr. Bannon,\" as he has \"become a major liability.\"\n\nIt's impossible to say just how much Bannon identifies with the far right, if at all. Although he likes to portray himself as an above-the-fray intellectual, Bannon has been accused of anti-Semitism by an ex-wife, and he made an anti-Asian statement on his radio program. His favorite books are said to include The Camp of the Saints, an anti-immigrant French novel, and the works of Italian fascist Julius Evola. Bannon has reportedly disparaged centrist members of the Trump administration as \"globalists\" and \"cucks,\" resorting to the kind of juvenile vitriol one doesn't often hear from a senior government official.\n\nDuring a Wednesday press conference that was supposed to be focused on infrastructure, Trump took questions on Charlottesville. He said he had not consulted Bannon about how to respond to Saturday's violence and called him \"a good man.\"\n\nHowever, Trump would not offer his chief strategist the kind of unequivocal support that could credibly pass for job security. \"We'll see,\" he said about Bannon's future prospects at the White House.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAnthony Scaramucci to Stephen Colbert: Trump Is

If the U.S. isn't focused on that, Bannon says China could become an economic hegemon in 25 or 30 years.\n\nEverything else -- North Korea, Charlottesville and identity politics -- is just a distraction to Bannon.\n\nSince the article was published Wednesday, Bannon said he never intended to do an interview. But in the article, Kuttner wrote that Bannon never stated whether the phone call was off the record.\n\nBannon's allies told CNN his actions were an intentional ploy to draw media attention away from Trump's controversial response to violence in Charlottesville. But Washington Post contributor Daniel Drezner tweeted Bannon's plan probably won't be well received: \"If he's not fired, he's bulletproof.\"", "id": "9811803", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Bannon May Not Have Meant To Contradict Trump  --  But He Did Just That", "image": "http://sharing.thedenverchannel.com/sharescnn/photo/2017/08/18/1503015129_64427700_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "120", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "121", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cnn.com"}, "id": "304269", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN"}, {"label": {"eng": "Military"}, "id": "304332", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hegemony"}, "id": "317584", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony"}, {"label": {"eng": "Second Sino-Japanese War"}, "id": "327858", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War"}, {"label": {"eng": "The American Prospect"}, "id": "350087", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Prospect"}, {"label": {"eng": "Identity politics"}, "id": "366725", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Economic nationalism"}, "id": "379906", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}, "id": "394340", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Kuttner"}, "id": "743029", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kuttner"}, {"label": {"eng": "Race (human categorization)"}, "id": "1083325", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 271, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 285, "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "uri": "dmoz/Society/History"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 286, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period", "uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 773, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes"}], "time": "02:46:00"}

He predicted that either the U.S. or China would be the world's dominant nation in the next quarter-century, \"and it's gonna be them if we go down this path.\"\n\nBannon told his interviewer that part of his plan to turn the economic tables on the Chinese government would be to issue complaints under the 1974 Trade Act, a move that he said had other government officials \"wetting themselves\" with concern over upsetting the international trading system or removing the possibility that China might help tamp down North Korea.\n\n\"To me,\" Bannon said, \"the economic war with China is everything.

I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more.\"\n\n\"These guys are a collection of clowns,\" he added.\n\nMr Bannon has distanced himself from \"ethno-nationalism\" before, telling the New York Times his interest in nationalism stems from wanting to curb the negative effects of globalisation.\n\nNorth Korea: Despite Donald Trump threatening North Korea with \"fire and fury\", in his interview Mr Bannon said there was no military solution to the crisis over the Pyongyang's nuclear programme.\n\n\"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us,\" he said.\n\nChina: Mr Bannon said if anything North Korea was just a \"sideshow\" to the real challenge the US is facing - \"economic war\" with China.\n\n\"If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover,\" he said, adding that the US intended to challenge China over intellectual property rights, and iron and steel dumping.\n\nIn response, the Chinese foreign ministry said joint trade brought \"real benefits\" to both sides, Reuters news agency reported. \"We hope that relevant parties can stop viewing issues of the 21st Century with a 19th or 20th Century mentality,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nWhite House infighting: Mr Bannon admitted he was facing an internal battle for the administration to take a firmer line on Chinese trade, but said opponents were \"wetting themselves\".", "id": "9672816", "details": {"liCnt": 3}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump

Bannon in February. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nThose White House advisers and Cabinet officials who were \"frustrated\" or \"unhappy\" Wednesday but not ready to quit have every reason to do so now. Stephen K. Bannon's unhinged, embarrassing and disloyal (the worst sin in this White House) interview with the American Prospect -- Anthony Scaramucci's New Yorker rant minus the obscenity -- gives them every reason to resign. In fact, absent his firing or resignation, they must resign.\n\nThe Post reports:\n\nStephen K. Bannon, the White House chief strategist, seemed to take issue with President Trump on North Korea, attacked white supremacists as \"clowns\" and \"losers\" and described his efforts against administration rivals in an unusual interview Wednesday with The American Prospect, a progressive magazine.\n\nThe interview with magazine co-editor and columnist Robert Kuttner was initiated by Bannon, Kuttner said, in an Anthony Scaramucci-style phone call out of the blue in response to a column Kuttner had written on China. . . .\n\n\"'They're wetting themselves,' he said, proceeding to detail how he would oust some of his opponents at State and Defense.\"\n\nOn North Korea, Bannon said: \"'Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.'\"\n\nHe also threw in a dig at those he's been publicly courting. (\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, eh, help crush it more. These guys are a collection of clowns.\") Hmm, it's probably unwise for him to throw under the bus now the most devoted Trump followers.\n\nA side-by-side look at how President Trump and Fox News pundits discussed the Charlottesville violence. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post)\n\n[Steve Bannon: Post-Charlottesville racial strife is a political winner for Trump]\n\nNow Bannon is in spin control:\n\nBannon told DailyMail.com that his remarks 'drew fire away from POTUS,' meaning President Trump, and that he successfully 'changed the [media] narrative' with a single phone call.\n\nIt's unclear if there has been any blowback in the West Wing from Bannon's unexpected on-the-record remarks to the magazine, which came in an unsolicited phone call on Wednesday.\n\nEven for this White House, it's a pathetic excuse, disproved by Trump's effort to double down on his Confederate statue infatuation with a series of tweets bemoaning the movement to take them down.\n\nFor White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, this is one more demonstration of his complete failure to normalize the White House, end backbiting, keep the team on the same page and end dysfunction. Between Trump's own conduct and his toleration of the destructive Bannon, things are worse than ever. Kelly has been made to look impotent, and his Cabinet members are now unable to operate without being publicly attacked by Bannon and his poodle, Sebastian Gorka.\n\nWhether the \"base is still with him\" or not, those in positions of authority in Trump's administration can no longer pretend they are doing good. If they stay, they've permanently empowered Bannon and enabled Trump to continue his political death spiral. Other than Defense Secretary Jim Mattis (who must have approved the anti-racist statements put out by the military service chiefs), who literally is there to prevent nuclear war, the rest of them should go. In unison, they may make an impression and finally galvanize Republicans to abandon the president.\n\nRead more from Right Turn:\n\nAbout the 'deplorables' . . .\n\nA big jump in percentage in favor of impeachment -- and other Trump poll horrors", "id": "9722970", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Opinion | Bannon is giving Trump's Cabinet every reason to quit", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/02/23/National-Politics/Images/CPAC4019.JPG?t=20170517", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "120", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "65774", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fox News Channel"}, "id": "302938", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Channel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Politics"}, "id": "302948", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}, "id": "303035", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}, "id": "304270", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}, "id": "307492", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail"}, {"label": {"eng": "The New Yorker"}, "id": "324492", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Defense"}, "id": "325016", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cabinet of the United States"}, "id": "328950", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "The West Wing"}, "id": "341660", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing"}, {"label": {"eng": "The American Prospect"}, "id": "350087", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Prospect"}, {"label": {"eng": "Anti-racism"}, "id": "375596", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House Chief of Staff"}, "id": "479316", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Kuttner"}, "id": "743029", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kuttner"}, {"label": {"eng": "John F.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\n(CNN)Everything we know about Steve Bannon's interview with Robert Kuttner, editor of the left-leaning American Prospect magazine, suggests that Bannon -- President Trump's chief strategist -- was being entirely candid about his political thinking in an unsolicited phone call to Kuttner.\n\nThat's a troubling thought. Bannon described a positive political advantage for the White House following Trump's \"both sides\" statements that indirectly supported the white supremacists responsible for the recent violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more. These guys are a collection of clowns,\" Bannon told Kuttner -- a cynical dismissal from the former editor of Breitbart news who last year gleefully described his media organization as \"the platform for the alt-right,\" that same \"fringe\" movement.And while military leaders, business titans and Republican former presidents have all taken pains to distance themselves from Trump's comments about the violence in Charlottesville, Bannon seems to be embracing the controversy as helpful to the White House. \"The Democrats -- the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day,\" Bannon said to Kuttner. \"If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"Read MoreThose are the stunningly irresponsible words of a man willing to shrug off the possible ramifications of growing racial division -- divisions that cost a young woman her life -- in order to reap political advantage.A recent poll of US adults found that 27% think the President's remarks about far-right extremists were \"strong enough,\" compared with the 52% majority who think Trump's comments weren't strong enough.But as Bannon is making clear, the White House sees a path to victory by leaving the difficult issue of race relations to the Democrats and focusing on jobs and the economy. It's hard to imagine a more cynical ploy. Bannon has tried to spin his interview with Kuttner as a strategy designed to draw media attention away from Trump, but that doesn't ring true.Democrats should be certain to recognize the game that Trump and Bannon are playing. The insensitive, inconsistent comments coming from the White House, it seems, are part of a plan to allow white nationalist \"clowns\" to bait Democrats into complaining about racism instead of fighting for tax and investment policies that help working class Americans.Democrats should remind Americans that it is they who are able to simultaneously fight against intolerance and develop policies that resonate with working-class households.

Betsy DeVos, in charge of education issues, seems capable of losing at tic-tac-toe. Ben Carson thought the great pyramids of Egypt were grain warehouses. Rick Perry, merely in charge of the nation's nuclear arsenal, probably has post-it notes all over his office to remind him what things are: telephone, family photo, souvenir atomic-reactor paperweight, etc.\n\nLots of dunces, but chief strategist Steve Bannon, sadly, isn't one of them. The intellectual leader of the alt-right movement is no genius - nobody with his political views could be - but neither is he an idiot. He's one of the few people in that White House with even a primitive grasp of long-term strategy, which makes his impulsive-seeming decision to call The American Prospect this week curious.\n\nIn the interview, Bannon said there was \"no military solution\" to North Korea's posturing. He stressed his efforts to fight economic war with China, adding, in a Scaramuccian touch, that his intramural foes on that front were \"wetting themselves.\"\n\nWhen asked about the Charlottesville tragedy, Bannon called the neo-Nazi marchers \"a collection of clowns.\" He also called them \"losers\" and a \"fringe element.\"\n\nThis theoretically should be a dark time for Bannon, since Charlottesville reminded the whole world of his inexplicable and indefensible presence in the White House. The story has even the National Review howling for his dismissal.\n\nBut Prospect writer Robert Kuttner noted with surprise in his piece that Bannon seemed upbeat. He essentially told Kuttner he believed the Charlottesville mess and stories like it were a long-term political windfall for people like himself.\n\n\"The longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" he said. \"I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nKuttner's write-up of this strange interview was interesting. He correctly wondered at Bannon's strategy of calling a progressive outlet like The Prospect, and in particular calling a writer like Kuttner, who has such an unequivocal recent history of bashing the president.\n\nKuttner also noted that Bannon, as media-savvy a person as there is in that White House, didn't even bring up the issue of whether or not the call was on the record.\n\nWas that an oversight? It seemed unlikely, given that exactly such an impromptu on-the-record phone call just got Anthony Scaramucci guillotined.\n\nI reached out to Kuttner and asked what he thought.\n\n\"I honestly think he messed up and forgot to put the conversation off the record, and treated it as a candid strategy talk with a comrade,\" Kuttner said. \"It came across as part candid strategy session and part stream of consciousness.\"\n\nOn one level, this sort of hey-we're-all-intellectuals-here banter is a ploy, not just transparent but insulting. Kuttner sniffed it out without much trouble.\n\n\"[Bannon] simultaneously tries to make alliances with lefties on economic nationalism, while doubling down on the racist, anti-immigrant stuff, and assumes that people will naively work with him on selected issues and excuse his larger role,\" he says. \"It's classic hubris.\"\n\nOn the other hand, what Bannon said probably did really reflect his thinking on some level. So what do we take from that?\n\nMainly, that he's dangerous.\n\nBannon's dismissal of the Charlottesville Nazis as \"losers\" who need to be suppressed - \"We gotta help crush\" them, he actually told Kuttner - seems insincere to say the least.\n\nBut remember: the snooty, college-based wing of the racialist right Bannon leads has always thought of itself as a cut above the mean - the thinking man's Nazi movement, if you will. And its leaders have always looked upon goose-steppers like the Charlottesville goons as political liabilities.\n\nThis comes through repeatedly in alt-right writing. Take the unofficial alt-right manifesto, published on Breitbart back when Bannon was still editor: \"The Establishment Conservative's Guide to the Alt-Right.\"\n\nWritten by Allum Bokhari and the infamous Milo Yiannopoulos, it describes a new-age racist movement, with goals beyond an adrenaline rush for beered-up hicks or shaven-headed teens.\n\n\"Skinheads, by and large, are low-information, low-IQ thugs driven by the thrill of violence and tribal hatred,\" they wrote. \"The alternative right are a much smarter group of people -- which perhaps suggests why the Left hates them so much. They're dangerously bright.\"\n\nA very arguable point, but they believe it. Milo/Allum went on:\n\n\"Those looking for Nazis under the bed can rest assured that they do exist. On the other hand, there's just not very many of them, no one really likes them, and they're unlikely to achieve anything significant in the alt-right.\"\n\nPassages like these are exactly what make the Bannonite alt-righters so dangerous. They're Nazis, but with media awareness. And they don't want to take over a Virginia street, or an Oregon bird sanctuary, for a few hours here and there. They have much broader ambitions. They want it all - the world, Chico.\n\nI personally am skeptical of the multiple news reports pointing at Bannon as the reason for Trump's outburst. It doesn't fit with what happened after Bannon came aboard to run Trump's campaign, oddly enough exactly a year ago this week.\n\nTrump on August 17th of last year was in the 27th day of an incredible poll tailspin, a devastating cascade that began after the Republican convention and continued through a series of seemingly fatal scandals and fiascos. Those included his insane broadside against Khizr Khan, an open call for Moscow to hack Hillary Clinton's emails, and a did-he-really-say-that call for \"Second Amendment people\" to \"maybe\" do something about his opponent.\n\nThese disasters had left Trump behind Clinton across the board, and more importantly by double digits or close to it in key states like Florida and Pennsylvania. There was seemingly no path to victory.\n\nThe almost universal assessment of conventional wisdom at the time, even on the Republican side, was that Trump's decision to bring Bannon in was political suicide. Bill Kristol, of all people, called it \"the merger of the Trump campaign with the kooky right.\"\n\nBut as soon as Bannon came aboard, Trump changed course in an unexpected direction. One change was stylistic. He started to read from prepared remarks on the stump more, cutting down on the off-the-cuff rants that had gotten him into so much trouble.\n\nContent-wise, this was the time when Trump embarked on his parody of a racial healing tour, telling mostly all-white crowds from Detroit to Des Moines that he would be the savior of black America. You might remember these infamous \"Black America, what do you have to lose?\" speeches.\n\nThis was all Bannon. Trump's path to victory, he reasoned, was simple: He just needed to recapture Mitt Romney's voters, and he would at least have a puncher's chance against a shaky Democratic candidate. But many Republicans thought of Trump as too overtly racist.\n\nBannon understood that the bulk of the Republican Party liked to think of itself as tolerant, and preferred that its bigotry be kept under the surface.\n\nHence the preposterous speeches about racial sensitivity to a succession of all-white audiences. I was one of many reporters who watched this act on the road last year and wondered if Trump, and by extension Bannon, had lost their minds.\n\nThey hadn't. Bannon's Machiavellian gambit, which was designed to give mainstream Republican voters psychological permission to vote for a racist candidate, saved Trump's campaign.\n\nIn less than a month, he not only completely reversed Trump's tailspin, but helped him gain ground besides. By mid-September, polls showed Trump within two points of Hillary, or even in a dead heat in some cases.\n\nDoes the architect of that strategy sound like the person who would urge Donald Trump to publicly embrace Nazis after Charlottesville? It's possible, I guess, but I doubt it.\n\nWhat seems more likely to me is that Bannon is generally responsible for developing these ideas in what's left of Trump's brain, which in turn spilled out in disorganized fashion when Trump himself decided to address the issue.\n\nIn contrast, Bannon's interview with Kuttner about the \"clowns\" of Charlottesville proves that no matter what he believes inside, he understands the optics of this immediate controversy far better than his boss does.\n\nAnd that's exactly why Bannon has to be fired. Trump once again has proved this week that by himself, he is too incompetent to marshal the political energy that swept him into office. The man is incapable of self-control or long-term strategic thought, and on some level, thank God for that.\n\nBut Bannon is the one person in that White House who we know for sure both embraces a white supremacist ideology and has a vision for how to implement it. The mere threat of that, that Trump's political energy might somehow be married to a sober strategy, is terrifying and unacceptable. Bannon saved Trump's political career once. He can't be allowed to do it again; he has to go, and finally let Trump drown on his own.", "id": "9766591", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Taibbi: Fire Steve Bannon", "image":

Bannon explained to Kuttner how economic nationalism formed the center of his political message.\n\n\"To me, the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover,\" Bannon said.\n\nBannon stressed that conflict with North Korea is a distraction from China, because North Korea would risk extinction if it uses its weapons.\n\n\"We're at economic war with China. It's in all their literature. They're not shy about saying what they're doing. One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path.

There's Treasury and [National Economic Council Chair] Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.\"\n\nBut some of the most newsworthy elements of the interview were Bannon's thoughts on racial identity politics.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers,\" he said. \"It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more.\"\n\nBannon's comments came just days after open protests by self-identified white nationalists in Charlottesville, Va.

I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats,\" he said.\n\nKuttner noted that, though he had never spoken with Bannon before, he \"came away from the conversation with a sense both of his savvy and his recklessness.\"\n\nRumors of Bannon's impending firing have circulated through the media in recent weeks.

Joe Scarborough tweeted that Bannon thinks he, not Trump, is president.\n\nThe reality is simpler. Bannon is consistent about promoting his \"economic nationalist\" agenda, which he sees as the key to Trump's long-term political success. In a week where the White House had hoped to focus on \"infrastructure\" and President Trump went disastrously off-message with his embrace of white supremacists, Bannon stayed on message.\n\nBannon has always envisioned Trump realigning American politics by uniting Democratic and Republican voters fed up with \"free trade\" policies that have hollowed out the American economy. He called Kuttner because the veteran editor is a cogent critic of those policies and consistent advocate of taking action against China for its mercantile policies.\n\nTrump is preparing to take such action against China, Bannon told Kuttner.\n\n\"To me,\" Bannon told Kuttner, \"the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nBannon shared details of how Trump plans to wage this war: By filing a complaint under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act against Chinese coercion of technology transfers from American corporations doing business there, and following up complaints that China has dumped steel and aluminum on American markets to depress prices and preserve Chinese exports. Bannon told Kuttner that the Section 301 complaint had been prepared, but was put on hold after Trump's threats to North Korea caused a storm of criticism, not the least from China.\n\nTalking to Kuttner in the wake of Charlottesville was Bannon's way of pushing this agenda deep in the heart of the liberal left intelligentsia. The American Prospect, which Kuttner founded 20-plus years ago, has been the launching pad for a generation of liberal Washington journalists from Josh Marshall to Ezra Klein. What better venue to show the world -- and the American left -- that Trump is serious about his anti-free trade agenda?\n\nThe idea of a trade war with China is of a piece with two populist proposals Bannon floated last month: raising the tax rate on the richest Americans to 44 percent, and regulating big internet companies like public utilities.\n\nIf Trump were actually capable of selling and implementing such policies, they might have the political impact Bannon envisions. But he isn't. Bannon is a font of clever ideas, but as his wardrobe demonstrates, he is a failure at followup.\n\nNothing scared Democrats more when Trump took office than the prospect that he was serious about Bannon's idea of a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan that would create a lot of high-paying jobs -- and convert working-class Democrats into Republican voters for a generation.\n\nIt turns out Trump wasn't serious. There are lots of proposals for rebuilding America's infrastructure. There is the AFL-CIO's plan. There is the Senate Democrats' Blueprint to Rebuild America's Infrastructure. Michael Bloomberg has a plan, the Building America's Future program. Any of these plans could have served as the core of a jobs program that would have driven a wedge between working-class and corporate Democrats.\n\nTrump and Bannon ignored them all and came out in favor of a recycled Republican proposal to privatize the country's air traffic control system, a scheme that wouldn't create any jobs and is opposed by Chesley Sullenberger, the country's most famous airline pilot.\n\nNow Bannon has taken on the mission impossible of trying to sell Trump's \"economic nationalism\" while denying it is tainted by his sympathy for white supremacists. As always, the White House adviser struck a confident tone. He says Charlottesville is a political winner for Trump.\n\n\"The Democrats,\" he said, \"the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nBut if Republican voters like Trump's response to Charlottesville (and an early poll shows they do), the response of the rest of the country makes it harder -- make that impossible -- for Trump to sell his brand of economic nationalism.\n\nTrump is now the one focused on race and identity, defending the neo-Nazis and neo-Confederates marching with torches and guns. Even during infrastructure week, Trump was not capable of sticking to a jobs message, preferring to tweet Thursday about the \"beauty\" of Confederate memorials. Bannon's strategic musings are clever, but not clever enough to hide the fact that his boss clearly cares more about defending white supremacy than creating American jobs.\n\nKuttner came away from the conversation with a sense of Bannon's \"savvy and his recklessness.\"\n\n\"The waters around him are rising, but he is going about his business of infighting, and attempting to cultivate improbable outside allies, to promote his China strategy,\" Kuttner wrote. \"His enemies will do what they do.\"\n\nBannon's enemies will see that Trump is losing allies, not gaining them. The corporate CEO class has deserted him en masse. The leaders of the armed forces have repudiated his attempt to blame \"both sides\" in Charlottesville. Cowardly congressional Republicans are averting their eyes, not offering support.\n\nCan Trump escape his troubles by \"cultivating improbable allies\" on the left?\n\nBannon thinks so. He closed his conversation with Kuttner by inviting him to the White House after Labor Day. Kuttner, a policy wonk par excellence, may be tempted by the offer of a seat at the policymaking table. He will only get a deck chair on the Titanic.", "id": "9821377", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "What Were Bannon's Motives for Calling a Liberal Journalist Out of the Blue?", "image":

Bannon described a positive political advantage for the White House following Trump's \"both sides\" statements that indirectly supported the white supremacists responsible for the recent violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more. These guys are a collection of clowns,\" Bannon told Kuttner -- a cynical dismissal from the former editor of Breitbart news who last year gleefully described his media organization as \"the platform for the alt-right,\" that same \"fringe\" movement.\n\nAnd while military leaders, business titans and Republican former presidents have all taken pains to distance themselves from Trump's comments about the violence in Charlottesville, Bannon seems to be embracing the controversy as helpful to the White House.\n\n\"The Democrats -- the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day,\" Bannon said to Kuttner. \"If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nThose are the stunningly irresponsible words of a man willing to shrug off the possible ramifications of growing racial division -- divisions that cost a young woman her life -- in order to reap political advantage.\n\nA recent poll of US adults found that 27% think the President's remarks about far-right extremists were \"strong enough,\" compared with the 52% majority who think Trump's comments weren't strong enough.\n\nBut as Bannon is making clear, the White House sees a path to victory by leaving the difficult issue of race relations to the Democrats and focusing on jobs and the economy.\n\nIt's hard to imagine a more cynical ploy. Bannon has tried to spin his interview with Kuttner as a strategy designed to draw media attention away from Trump, but that doesn't ring true.\n\nDemocrats should be certain to recognize the game that Trump and Bannon are playing. The insensitive, inconsistent comments coming from the White House, it seems, are part of a plan to allow white nationalist \"clowns\" to bait Democrats into complaining about racism instead of fighting for tax and investment policies that help working class Americans.\n\nDemocrats should remind Americans that it is they who are able to simultaneously fight against intolerance and develop policies that resonate with working-class households.

It's in all their literature. They're not shy about saying what they're doing. One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and its gonna be them if we go down this path,\" Bannon said to author and professor Robert Kuttner.\n\n\"The economic war with China is everything. And we have have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover,\" he continued.\n\nBannon indicated that the current tensions and threats surrounding the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), also known as North Korea, are just a \"sideshow\" for the battle for global hegemony with China. He said he is pressuring within the Trump administration to use the tensions in Korea as a way to impose economic pressure on China.\n\n\"We're going to run the tables on these guys [China]. We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us,\" he said.\n\nAlthough Trump has repeatedly engaged in beligerant rhetoric toward the DPRK, saying that the U.S.'s arsenal is \"locked and loaded\" and that the North Korean people will face \"fire and fury,\" Bannon directly rejected the potential for a military confrontation on the peninsula.\n\n\"There's no military solution [to the DPRK's nuclear threats], forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us,\" Bannon said.\n\nRELATED:\n\nUS Rejects China-backed 'Double Freeze,' to Continue Joint South-Korean Military Exercises: State Dept\n\nThe DPRK has continued its program to develop ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons in spite of pressure and threats demanding that they halt the efforts. They claim that the weapons act as a deterrent to a potential U.S. invasion or regime change attempt.\n\nBannon went on to explain how he was acting withing the Trump administration to push anti-China economic policies, such as the recently announced Section 301 complaint from the 1974 Trade Act targeting China's alleged \"unfair\" trade practices. His struggle is within the administration also, where he said he fights \"every day\" against the \"apparatus\" to pressure those within the administration to follow his line and sideline those who don't.\n\nChina has been pushing for a \"double freeze\" plan, which would involve the U.S. halting its military exercises on the Korean Peninsula, which is a key demand of the DPRK, in exchange for Pyongyang stopping its missile tests. On Tuesday, U.S. Department of State spokesperson Heather Nauert scoffed at the idea that such a deal would take place. Bannon however, indicated he might consider such a deal, but that such prospects were remote.\n\nTrump is currently embroiled in criticism domestically and internationally for placing the blame for violence on \"both sides\" of the recent neo-Nazi and white-nationalist rally that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia, that resulted in a death and numerous injuries when a white-nationalist drove a car into a group of counter-protesters.\n\nBannon however, dismissed white nationalists as \"a collection of clowns.\"\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism - it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much,\" he said.\n\nWhile he rejected \"ethno-nationalism\" in the interview, he made clear that he was embracing economic nationalism, as embodied in his anti-China crusades. \"If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats,\" he said. \"I want them to talk about racism every day.\"\n\nAs a former editor of the far-right wing publication Breitbart News, Bannon is considered to be a major figure within the U.S. far-right, and a major ideological force within the Trump administration as the White

AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster\n\nSteve Bannon, the Trump administration's chief strategist, says he has a comprehensive plan to reshape US-China relations. In a wide-ranging interview with the progressive-leaning publication The American Prospect published on Wednesday, Bannon said of China: \"We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us.\"\n\n\"The economic war with China is everything,\" Bannon told writer Robert Kuttner. He warned that the US would be on the verge of an \"inflection point\" in which China could overtake the US as the world's No. 1 superpower within a decade.\n\nBannon represents the nationalist wing of the White House, a group that ostensibly sees the US' diplomatic clout and financial largesse as being exploited by other nations, including China.\n\nAlong with senior advisers Sebastian Gorka and Stephen Miller, Bannon has sought to promote President Donald Trump's \"America first\" agenda which, among other things, broadly calls for the US to rely less on other nations and discontinue policies Trump sees as disadvantageous to Americans.\n\nTrump took further steps in that direction on Monday when he announced that he intended to sign a measure that would open an investigation into intellectual property violations against American companies by Chinese firms.\n\nThe measure draws upon Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, which would allow Trump to place a tariff on another country without Congressional approval, Business Insider's Linette Lopez wrote on Monday, adding that such a move would be seen by China as an act of aggression amid lingering uncertainty surrounding Chinese ally North Korea, and its nuclear ambitions.\n\nBannon insisted the Trump administration needed to be \"maniacally focused\" on its economic war with China and claimed the US \"may never recover\" if it loses.", "id": "9590845", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "'We're at economic war with China': Steve Bannon lays out China trade plans in wide-ranging interview",

That one cost Scaramucci his job 10 days in for its combination of profanity, allusions to sex acts and backstabbing.\n\nStill, Bannon knew that history when he decided to unload his opinions to the liberal co-editor of the American Prospect, Robert Kuttner, whom he had never met.\n\nHe is either very confident in his job status or wants to get a few things off his chest before seeing the exit.\n\nBannon spoke openly about dispatching rivals in the administration, including in the Defense and State departments, who oppose his drive to confront China on trade. \"They're wetting themselves,\" he added.\n\nAnd he flatly contradicted Trump's strategy of tough talk in the face of North Korea's nuclear threat: \"There's no military solution, forget it.\"\n\n\"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, \" Bannon said. \"There's no military solution here, they got us.\"\n\nTrump has all but declared victory after Kim Jong Un tamped down his threats to attack Guam this week.\n\nSuch a sharp public contradiction on such an important and volatile issue is startling for a top aide who expects to keep his job. Indeed, Trump failed to give Bannon a vote of confidence on Tuesday, throwing more intrigue into the American Prospect article.\n\nSo was he on the record? Some allies have suggested that Bannon did not think he was. But Kuttner seemed to anticipate those arguments, saying that the question never came up in their phone call. Like most reporters, he therefore considered it on the record.\n\nBannon is, after all, a former news chief.\n\n\"Steve Bannon is not exactly Bambi when it comes to dealing with the press,\" Kuttner wrote. \"He's probably the most media-savvy person in America.\"\n\nLatest updates Copyright \u00a9 2017, Los Angeles Times", "id": "9691984", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Embattled

Turns out the former Breitbart editor had no idea he was being interviewed. He thought he was just shooting the shit with the reporter.\n\nAccording to Axios, Bannon called up Robert Kuttner because he wanted to discuss the journalists stance on China. Both he and fellow White House staffers are reportedly shocked that Bannon's conversations with Kuttner were actually published. This isn't great news for Bannon because he says a few things in this interview that his boss may not care for. Specifically, he completely cuts the legs out from under Trump's threats to North Korea. From The American Prospect:\n\nThere's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats], forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\n\nSo, no fire and fury then? Oh well.\n\n\"I'll put this in terms he'll understand: This is DEFCON 1-level bad,\" one source told Axios in regards to Bannon's comments about Trump's foreign policy.\n\nBannon also said the media plays up the fringe elements of the right too much and the admin needs to \"help crush\" ethno-nationalism. He even referred to the alt-right as \"a collection of clowns.\" A weird thing for him to say considering he once called Breitbart \"the platform for the alt-right.\" Bannon, along with adviser Stephen Miller, also usually has a hand in crafting Trump's more xenophobic policy positions and speeches. You can't just make that go away after a group of white supremacists who self-identify as \"alt-right\" gather for a rally where somebody gets murdered and another person has a stroke after being beaten.\n\nOf course, the entire thing could be ruse as well. As a former \"news\" man, Bannon would be fully aware that if he was speaking to a journalist, his words were liable to show up in print eventually. Exactly what purpose this would solve, isn't exactly clear, but then I'm not a chief strategist.\n\n[Axios | Photo: Getty]", "id": "9605333", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Steve Bannon accidentally undermined Trump's posturing on North Korea in a liberal magazine", "image": "https://static.deathandtaxesmag.com/uploads/2017/08/GettyImages-691277784-1502937401-compressed.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "120", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "65774", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "Xenophobia"}, "id": "304546", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}, "id": "305377", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}, "id": "313796", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism"}, {"label": {"eng": "DEFCON"}, "id": "336892", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFCON"}, {"label": {"eng": "The American Prospect"}, "id": "350087", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Prospect"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "396058", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vardar", "label": {"eng": "Vardar"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethnic nationalism"}, "id": "518051", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Kuttner"}, "id": "743029", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kuttner"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alt-right"}, "id": "1268917", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 291, "label": "dmoz/News/Media", "uri": "dmoz/News/Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 464, "label": "dmoz/News/Media/Journalism", "uri": "dmoz/News/Media/Journalism"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 492, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 596, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 797, "label": "dmoz/News/Alternative", "uri": "dmoz/News/Alternative"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1088, "label": "dmoz/Computers/History/Pioneers", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/History/Pioneers"}], "time": "03:44:00"}

Yeah, not sarcastic this time. I did not anticipate seeing any interview with Steve Bannon overnight, much less this one, and it seems I'm not alone in that. Nobody expected this. Not even Steve Bannon, apparently.\n\nIn his interview with leftwing American Prospect, the chief White House strategist and arguable architect of Trump's surprise victory last year cut loose, contradicted the president, and bashed his Breitbart-beloved alt-right.\n\nYep.\n\nWith the rumor mill in high gear that his future is in jeopardy, the man behind the Trump doesn't seem phased, reports the Prospect.\n\nBut Bannon was in high spirits when he phoned me Tuesday afternoon to discuss the politics of taking a harder line with China, and minced no words describing his efforts to neutralize his rivals at the Departments of Defense, State, and Treasury. \"They're wetting themselves,\" he said, proceeding to detail how he would oust some of his opponents at State and Defense.\n\nChipper thought. He also directly contradicted both the President and the word of the United States government at large when he said that all of Trump's North Korea talk was so much bunk. That's not a quote. But it's damn close to one:\n\nContrary to Trump's threat of fire and fury, Bannon said: \"There's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats], forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\" Bannon went on to describe his battle inside the administration to take a harder line on China trade, and not to fall into a trap of wishful thinking in which complaints against China's trade practices now had to take a backseat to the hope that China, as honest broker, would help restrain Kim.\n\n\"To me,\" Bannon said, \"the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nNo military solution. Neither fire nor fury. That's a wow all by itself, and will certainly have repercussions today. He undermined the America's word and denied our ability to back up talk with action. Sad.\n\nLike all the other alt-Reich people with something to lose, Bannon is now trying to distance himself from his former fellows. And to make it sound like they were never his in the first place.\n\nHe dismissed the far right as irrelevant and sidestepped his own role in cultivating it: \"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more.\"\n\n\"These guys are a collection of clowns,\" he added.\n\nWhile the statement itself is true, they are losers, this is amazingly dishonest. He and his website could not have done more to court white supremacists if they'd offered a dowry and giggle coyly at all their jokes. In fact, I think they kinda did that actual thing. The giggling bit, anyway.\n\nSo what is going on here? Is he on the way out and setting fire as he leaves the barn? Is he trying deliberately to push getting fired?\n\nThere's more at American Prospect. I don't know what he's up to, but if we've learned anything in the last year, we know he's up to something.

all issues over which Bannon and McMaster have sparred.\n\n\"Bannon Could be Demoted Instead of Fired\"\n\nBannon has been in a precarious position before but Trump has opted to keep him, in part because his chief strategist played a major role in his election victory and is backed by many of the president's most loyal rank-and-file supporters.\n\n\"The president obviously is very nervous and afraid of firing him,\" a source close to the White House told Reuters.\n\nThe source floated the possibility that Bannon could be demoted instead of fired, noting that he might turn into a harsh critic of the administration if he is forced out of the inner circle.\n\nTwo other senior officials, both supporters of McMaster who asked not to be identified, said he blames Bannon for a series of attacks against him by right-wing website Breitbart News, which Bannon used to lead, and other far-right conservative groups.\n\nIn recent weeks, Breitbart has published a series of articles making a case for McMaster's ouster on the basis that he is not a strong ally of Israel and that he has staffed the National Security Council with holdovers from the Obama administration.\n\nOne of the senior officials said McMaster's anger over the campaign \"is known to the president\" but declined to say whether the national security adviser had told Trump directly or through General John Kelly, an ally and the president's new chief of staff.\n\nMcMaster isn't saying Bannon is the mastermind behind the campaign, but he does think Bannon could stop it if he wanted to.\n\nA defender of McMaster\n\nIn a television interview on Sunday, McMaster repeatedly declined to answer when asked if he could work with Bannon.\n\nAbout their feud, Bannon declined to comment and McMaster was unavailable for comment.\n\nInstead of firing Bannon, Trump could move McMaster into a position outside the White House, possibly back to an active military command role, or keep both men where they are and insist on some form of truce.\n\nAlso Read: Trump Disbands Business Advisory Councils After CEOs Exit\n\nBannon - Defender of Trump's Nationalist Base\n\nBannon has survived other White House power struggles this year and established a detente with Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner after a scolding from the president.\n\nThe two senior officials who support McMaster said Kelly is angry that the anti-McMaster campaign has made the White House appear chaotic, reflecting badly on him as he was brought in as chief of staff two weeks ago to restore order and discipline.\n\nBannon sees himself as the defender of Trump's nationalist base and has advocated for both an end or renegotiation of trade deals and a more isolationist approach to foreign affairs than McMaster.\n\nHe has pushed to scrap the 2015 nuclear weapons agreement with Iran, which McMaster argues should remain in place, and has also proposed using contractors to fight the war in Afghanistan rather than expanding US forces there, as McMaster has advocated.\n\nMcMaster is part of a more pragmatic group that Bannon likes to label \"globalists.\"\n\nHe drew the fury of Bannon's supporters by recently overhauling the White House's National Security Council, pushing out four staffers who were seen as close to Bannon.\n\nConservative commentator Mike Cernovich is a Bannon ally and has been a vocal critic of McMaster, even leveling personal attacks against him.\n\nCernovich says he does not talk directly to Bannon but praises him as an important counterweight to McMaster.\n\nHe also warns that the president would alienate his most loyal supporters if he fires Bannon.\n\nI don't think that people who like Trump are suddenly going to say, 'We're going to fight Trump.' Instead they'll say, 'What's the point of supporting him?'\n\nMike Cernovich to Reuters\n\nThe conservative Jewish-American and pro-Israel group Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), which also has close ties to Bannon, has been one of McMaster's sharpest critics, urging Trump to reassign him away from policy areas dealing with Israel and Iran.\n\nTrump has himself backed McMaster, saying he was a \"good man and very pro-Israel\".\n\nA source close to the ZOA bristled at the suggestion that Bannon was influencing its approach and said it would not tone down the campaign against McMaster, despite entreaties by Bannon to do so.\n\n\"We find it remarkably offensive that anyone would suggest that Steve Bannon or anyone else tells us what to say or what not to say,\" the source said. \"It makes me feel awful that he's getting blamed for this, but there's nothing I can do about it.\"\n\n(This article was published in an arrangement with Reuters)\n\nAlso Read: In Phone Call, Modi & Trump Agree to Peace in Indo-Pacific Region\n\nFirst published: 17 August, 2017 10:36 AM IST", "id": "9738597", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Will Bannon be Banished?

I can tell you that. He is a good person. He actually gets a very unfair press in that regard,' Trump said in response to a question about whether he'll keep him.\n\n'We'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon. He is a good person and I think the press treats him, frankly, very unfairly.'\n\nA White House aide told Buzzfeed that 'the president is not happy with the Joshua Green book. Every other page is a love letter to Steve Bannon.'\n\nBannon joined the Trump campaign after the president had secured the GOP nomination.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Bannon's fate will align with those of ousted White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and former press secretary Sean Spicer, who had on-again, off-again relationships with Trump's public approval before departing the administration under criticism from conservatives who lost patience with the Republican Party moderates.\n\nTrump tweeted last month that so-called 'geniuses' who helped him win were secondary to his own charisma and campaigning savvy\n\nNow it's conservatives who are backing Bannon, frustrated that a stone-tough populist economic movement could devolve into a garden variety Republican administration.\n\n'If Bannon is fired, this Republican White House, which is supposed to be nationalist conservative, would be fully staffed by generals, Democrats, Clinton voters and the occasional Bush aide,' a Bannon ally said.\n\n'What is this, the Twilight Zone?'\n\nBannon has continued to signal that the president must keep his ties to his base strong, and to mock Democrats for creating distracting news cycles about race relations in America.\n\n'This past election, the Democrats used every personal attack, including charges of racism, against President Trump. He then won a landslide victory on a straightforward platform of economic nationalism,' Bannon told The Washington Post on Thursday.\n\n'As long as the Democrats fail to understand this, they will continue to lose. But leftist elites do not value history, so why would they learn from history?'\n\nTrump has gone out of his way to distance himself from a media narrative that credits his inner circle, and not the president himself, for his election triumph.\n\n'I love reading about all of the \"geniuses\" who were so instrumental in my election success.

The e-mailer said White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon wanted to talk to him.\n\nBut why Kuttner? And why then, on the day of what Kuttner calls President Donald Trump's \"calamitous news conference\" about Charlottesville?\n\n\"I wasn't totally surprised that he would call me,\" Kuttner said Thursday, \"because as he explained in the conversation, his strategic view here is that there are some lefties who think we're being taken to the cleaners by China, there are some righties who think that, so you pull together a grand coalition.\"\n\nNot that Kuttner thinks Bannon or Trump would ever brag to fellow conservatives about having the editor of the American Prospect on their side.\n\nBut Kuttner was surprised that Bannon was so frank in his comments, on the record.\n\n\"About two minutes into the conversation, it dawned on me that he never bothered to put this off the record,\" Kuttner said. \"I was just stunned that the conversation went on and on and on. He's talking strategy, and he's being incredibly indiscreet in the way he's trashing various colleagues.\"\n\nBannon went on to talk about economic policy, particularly what he feels is a coming trade war with China, as well as Trump's posturing toward North Korea, which Bannon called a \"sideshow.\"\n\nOur conversation, lightly edited for clarity, is below:\n\nTHE WASHINGTON POST: Can you take me through that unexpected phone call? How did Mr. Bannon get in touch, and why did he want to talk?\n\nKUTTNER: I was totally stunned.\n\nI mean, I'm on vacation in the Berkshires, listening to music and going to Shakespeare, about midday on Tuesday. And that was the day that Trump's calamitous news conference happened. Later on in the afternoon, I get his e-mail from a young guy identifying himself as coming from Bannon's office. \"Mr. Bannon would like to meet with you at the White House.\"\n\nSo I look at the \"456\" number, I looked at the EOP e-mail address. It looked legitimate, I called him. It was legitimate. So we set up a time. About 45 minutes later, Bannon called and he started out by flattering me, telling me how he'd been a fan of mine for years and we seem to be exactly in the same place on our view of China, and blah blah blah.\n\nAnd about two minutes into the conversation, it dawned on me that he never bothered to put this off the record. And obviously the ground rules in journalism are that if a high government official calls you and doesn't bother to say it's off the record, you assume that it's on the record.\n\nAnd so I was just stunned that the conversation went on and on and on. He's talking strategy and he's being incredibly indiscreet in the way he's trashing various colleagues, and explaining how he's going to get this one fired and take over, and then we get into the Korea/China nuclear story. And I think it was a column that I'd written on this a day earlier saying that China was really taking advantage of us, because in order to get their help on Korea we're going to have to fold our hands on trade. And that's Bannon's view. And he also was astonishingly dismissive of his boss' view of saber-rattling, saying that that's not going to happen, because 10 million people in greater Seoul would get killed. And so far, from calling me to defend his boss, this was one of the interesting things. He called me to advance his own agenda, whether he thought it was on the record or off the record.\n\nAnd he was quite cavalier in saying things that were quite at odds with the presumed administration line, if there is one, both on China-Korea, where the line is, we're going to make nice with them now, for a while anyway, and see if they help us out with Korea.\n\nAnd then when I push him on the white nationalist stuff. You say what you need to say, so he starts saying some very dismissive things about the base that he helped create. And the most astonishing thing of all -- I don't know if you've seen this -- but the Daily Mail last evening has this interview where Bannon, having said that, \"Oh, this was a misunderstanding, I didn't realize this was on the record.\"\n\nNow he's saying, \"I did this deliberately to help the president out by diverting attention from all the stuff that's going on in the aftermath of Charlottesville.\" So you wonder how clearly he's thinking. I guess that's one question. And I think you could attribute this to hubris in the sense that, if you're so full of yourself, your judgment starts faltering, and then there are some people who have said, \"No no no. He did this deliberately he wanted to get these views out.\" I don't think so. This was like a stream of consciousness.\n\nAnd it's not exactly a secret that Bannon talks to press people. Scaramucci was obsessing about leaks. Bannon is one of the people who talked to the press off the record. So I suppose you could say this was a rookie error on his part. But this guy is not exactly a rookie. So I was kind of a little baffled at why he didn't put this off the record. I wasn't totally surprised that he would call me, because as he explained in the conversation, his strategic view here is that there are some lefties who think we're being taken to the cleaners by China, there are some righties who think that, so you pull together a grand coalition.\n\nI also thought that was odd, because you can imagine Trump going around the White House and the Defense Department and the State Department, saying, \"Hey, I got Bob Kuttner on my side.\" That doesn't exactly enhance his credibility with his colleagues.\n\nPOST: Why did he reach out to you? You don't exactly align with Breitbart, for example, which he used to run.\n\nKUTTNER: He's a risk taker, and he's a proselytizer, and he thinks he can win people over to his view of economic nationalism and he's got enough bravado and enough self-confidence that I think he enjoys engaging lefties just for sport. And I think he can learn something by engaging lefties. And he also couldn't resist gloating about how he and the president are promoting xenophobia, getting tough with immigrants while the left is sort of stuck on fighting racism. And he basically said we win that fight. So he was all over the place in terms of whether he was distancing himself from racists or embracing them in a more subtle way.\n\nPOST: There's this idea that Bannon is some kind of puppet-master, planning this all out on a grand scale and controlling things behind the scenes. But it seems like this was more spur-of-the-moment?\n\nKUTTNER: Oh, I don't think the two are mutually exclusive. On the one hand he's got his own agenda on trade and he's sort of obsessively pursuing that. On the other hand, you have to believe that the president doubling down on getting in bed with the racists and the neo-Nazis and maybe pardoning Joe Arpaio -- it's impossible not to see Steve Bannon's hand in that.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of tactic where Bannon would be encouraging Trump to be true to his own instincts. And I think if Bannon doesn't get fired, and I guess this is my most important takeaway. He's got enemies all over the administration. But the one guy who counts, the president, relies on Bannon for the architecture of this alliance with the far right. And the connection between anti-immigrant policies and getting into bed with racists and maybe a dose of economic nationalism, even though it's not clear that the president's going to deliver on that. So it will be very telling of where Trump is on this stuff, when we find out whether Bannon survives.", "id": "9769792", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "American Prospect editor says he

Peter King (R-N.Y.) called on Trump to fire Bannon.\n\n\"He should go,\" King told ABC7 news, citing Bannon's interview, in which the former Breitbart News executive chairman said about Democrats in the wake of the Charlottesville, Va., attack: \"I want them to talk about racism every day.\n\n\"If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats,\" Bannon said.\n\nKing said Bannon's statement \"says that he is exploiting the racial issue. That can't be allowed.\"\n\nKing also criticized Bannon's comments about North Korea, saying Bannon \"is undercutting the president, the secretary of defense, the secretary of state and the head of the National Security Council.\"\n\n\"To me, his time in the White House should be over,\" King said.\n\nBut a number of Republican strategists and congressional aides told the Herald that despite growing irritation at Bannon from within the party, confronting the president comes with its own hazards -- primarily facing the ire of Trump and those who voted for him.\n\n\"I don't think voters who voted for him are under any illusion about who they put in office,\" O'Connell said. \"They don't always like what he's done as candidate or in office, but they really like his agenda.\"\n\nAnd GOP lawmakers will work with Trump, despite Bannon, O'Connell said, \"because their political lives depend on it.\"\n\nTrump himself fanned the flames of palace intrigue during a news conference Tuesday when asked about Bannon's future.\n\n\"We'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon,\" Trump said.\n\nBut Republicans cited Trump's instinct to push back against criticism and double down on actions that draw it.

Bannon on Aug. 15. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nRobert Kuttner, the co-founder and co-editor of the American Prospect, got an email from an address he didn't recognize Tuesday afternoon. The emailer said White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon wanted to talk to him.\n\nBut why Kuttner? And why then, on the day of what Kuttner calls President Trump's \"calamitous news conference\" about Charlottesville?\n\n\"I wasn't totally surprised that he would call me,\" Kuttner said in an interview Thursday, \"because as he explained in the conversation, his strategic view here is that there are some lefties who think we're being taken to the cleaners by China, there are some righties who think that, so you pull together a grand coalition.\"\n\nNot that Kuttner thinks Bannon or Trump would ever brag to fellow conservatives about having the editor of the American Prospect on their side.\n\nBut Kuttner was surprised that Bannon was so frank in his comments, on the record.\n\n\"About two minutes into the conversation, it dawned on me that he never bothered to put this off the record,\" Kuttner said. \"I was just stunned that the conversation went on and on and on. He's talking strategy, and he's being incredibly indiscreet in the way he's trashing various colleagues.\"\n\nBannon went on to talk about economic policy, particularly what he feels is a coming trade war with China, as well as Trump's posturing toward North Korea, which Bannon called a \"sideshow.\"\n\nOur conversation, lightly edited for clarity, is below:\n\nTHE FIX: Can you take me through that unexpected phone call? How did Mr. Bannon get in touch, and why did he want to talk?\n\nKUTTNER: I was totally stunned.\n\nI mean, I'm on vacation in the Berkshires, listening to music and going to Shakespeare, about midday on Tuesday. And that was the day that Trump's calamitous news conference happened. Later on in the afternoon, I get his email from a young guy identifying himself as coming from Bannon's office. \"Mr. Bannon would like to meet with you at the White House.\"\n\nSo I look at the \"456\" number, I looked at the EOP email address. It looked legitimate, I called him. It was legitimate. So we set up a time. About 45 minutes later, Bannon called and he started out by flattering me, telling me how he'd been a fan of mine for years and we seem to be exactly in the same place on our view of China, and blah blah blah.\n\nAnd about two minutes into the conversation, it dawned on me that he never bothered to put this off the record. And obviously the ground rules in journalism are that if a high government official calls you and doesn't bother to say it's off the record, you assume that it's on the record.\n\nAnd so I was just stunned that the conversation went on and on and on. He's talking strategy and he's being incredibly indiscreet in the way he's trashing various colleagues, and explaining how he's going to get this one fired and take over, and then we get into the Korea/China nuclear story. And I think it was a column that I'd written on this a day earlier saying that China was really taking advantage of us, because in order to get their help on Korea we're going to have to fold our hands on trade. And that's Bannon's view. And he also was astonishingly dismissive of his boss's view of saber-rattling, saying that that's not going to happen, because 10 million people in greater Seoul would get killed. And so far, from calling me to defend his boss, this was one of the interesting things. He called me to advance his own agenda, whether he thought it was on the record or off the record.\n\nAnd he was quite cavalier in saying things that were quite at odds with the presumed administration line, if there is one, both on China-Korea, where the line is, we're going to make nice with them now, for a while anyway, and see if they help us out with Korea.\n\nAnd then when I push him on the white nationalist stuff. You say what you need to say, so he starts saying some very dismissive things about the base that he helped create. And the most astonishing thing of all -- I don't know if you've seen this -- but the Daily Mail last evening has this interview where Bannon, having said that, \"Oh, this was a misunderstanding, I didn't realize this was on the record.\"\n\nNow he's saying, \"I did this deliberately to help the president out by diverting attention from all the stuff that's going on in the aftermath of Charlottesville.\" So you wonder how clearly he's thinking. I guess that's one question. And I think you could attribute this to hubris in the sense that, if you're so full of yourself, your judgment starts faltering, and then there are some people who have said, \"No no no. He did this deliberately he wanted to get these views out.\" I don't think so. This was like a stream of consciousness.\n\nAnd it's not exactly a secret that Bannon talks to press people. Scaramucci was obsessing about leaks. Bannon is one of the people who talked to the press off the record. So I suppose you could say this was a rookie error on his part. But this guy is not exactly a rookie. So I was kind of a little baffled at why he didn't put this off the record. I wasn't totally surprised that he would call me, because as he explained in the conversation, his strategic view here is that there are some lefties who think we're being taken to the cleaners by China, there are some righties who think that, so you pull together a grand coalition.\n\nI also thought that was odd, because you can imagine Trump going around the White House and the Defense Department and the State Department, saying, \"Hey, I got Bob Kuttner on my side.\" That doesn't exactly enhance his credibility with his colleagues.\n\nFIX: Why did he reach out to you? You don't exactly align with Breitbart, for example, which he used to run.\n\nKUTTNER: He's a risk taker, and he's a proselytizer, and he thinks he can win people over to his view of economic nationalism and he's got enough bravado and enough self-confidence that I think he enjoys engaging lefties just for sport. And I think he can learn something by engaging lefties. And he also couldn't resist gloating about how he and the president are promoting xenophobia, getting tough with immigrants while the left is sort of stuck on fighting racism. And he basically said we win that fight. So he was all over the place in terms of whether he was distancing himself from racists or embracing them in a more subtle way.\n\nFIX: There's this idea that Bannon is some kind of puppet-master, planning this all out on a grand scale and controlling things behind the scenes. But it seems like this was more spur-of-the-moment?\n\nKUTTNER: Oh, I don't think the two are mutually exclusive. On the one hand he's got his own agenda on trade and he's sort of obsessively pursuing that. On the other hand, you have to believe that the president doubling down on getting in bed with the racists and the neo-Nazis and maybe pardoning Joe Arpaio -- it's impossible not to see Steve Bannon's hand in that.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of tactic where Bannon would be encouraging Trump to be true to his own instincts. And I think if Bannon doesn't get fired, and I guess this is my most important takeaway. He's got enemies all over the administration. But the one guy who counts, the president, relies on Bannon for the architecture of this alliance with the far right. And the connection between anti-immigrant policies and getting into bed with racists and maybe a dose of economic nationalism, even though it's not clear that the president's going to deliver on that. So it will be very telling of where Trump is on this stuff, when we find out whether Bannon survives.", "id": "9751493", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Analysis | Robert Kuttner says

McMaster and political strategist Stephen Bannon has reached a level of animosity that is destabilizing Trump's team of top advisers just as the administration tries to regain lost momentum, three senior officials said.\n\nUnder pressure from moderate Republicans to fire Bannon, Trump declined to publicly back him on Tuesday, although he left his options open. \"We'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon,\" he told reporters at Trump Tower in New York.\n\nWhatever Trump decides could chart the fate of a nuclear-weapons deal with Iran, U.S. troop deployments to Afghanistan and White House staffing decisions - all issues over which Bannon and McMaster have sparred. Bannon has been in a precarious position before but Trump has opted to keep him, in part because his chief strategist played a major role in his election victory and is backed by many of the president's most loyal rank-and-file supporters.\n\n\"The president obviously is very nervous and afraid of firing him,\" a source close to the White House told Reuters. The source floated the possibility that Bannon could be demoted instead of fired, noting that he might turn into a harsh critic of the administration if he is forced out of the inner circle.\n\nTwo other senior officials, both supporters of McMaster who asked not to be identified, said he blames Bannon for a series of attacks against him by right-wing website Breitbart News, which Bannon used to lead, and other far-right conservative groups. In recent weeks, Breitbart has published a series of articles making a case for McMaster's ouster on the basis that he is not a strong ally of Israel and that he has staffed the National Security Council with holdovers from the Obama administration.\n\nOne of the senior officials said McMaster's anger over the campaign \"is known to the president\" but declined to say whether the national security adviser had told Trump directly or through General John Kelly, an ally and the president's new chief of staff. \"McMaster isn't saying Bannon is the mastermind behind the campaign, but he does think Bannon could stop it if he wanted to,\" said one of McMaster's defenders.\n\nIn a television interview on Sunday, McMaster repeatedly declined to answer when asked if he could work with Bannon. About their feud, Bannon declined to comment and McMaster was unavailable for comment.\n\nInstead of firing Bannon, Trump could move McMaster into a position outside the White House, possibly back to an active military command role, or keep both men where they are and insist on some form of truce. Bannon has survived other White House power struggles this year and established a detente with Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner after a scolding from the president.\n\nThe two senior officials who support McMaster said Kelly is angry that the anti-McMaster campaign has made the White House appear chaotic, reflecting badly on him as he was brought in as chief of staff two weeks ago to restore order and discipline.\n\nBannon sees himself as the defender of Trump's nationalist base and has advocated for both an end or renegotiation of trade deals and a more isolationist approach to foreign affairs than McMaster. He has pushed to scrap the 2015 nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran, which McMaster argues should remain in place, and has also proposed using contractors to fight the war in Afghanistan rather than expanding U.S. forces there, as McMaster has advocated.\n\nMcMaster is part of a more pragmatic group that Bannon likes to label \"globalists.\" He drew the fury of Bannon's supporters by recently overhauling the White House's National Security Council, pushing out four staffers who were seen as close to Bannon.\n\nConservative commentator Mike Cernovich is a Bannon ally and has been a vocal critic of McMaster, even leveling personal attacks against him. Cernovich says he does not talk directly to Bannon but praises him as an important counterweight to McMaster.\n\nHe also warns that the president would alienate his most loyal supporters if he fires Bannon. \"I don't think that people who like Trump are suddenly going to say, 'We're going to fight Trump.' Instead they'll say, 'What's the point of supporting him?'\" Cernovich told Reuters.\n\nThe conservative Jewish-American and pro-Israel group Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), which also has close ties to Bannon, has been one of McMaster's sharpest critics, urging Trump to reassign him away from policy areas dealing with Israel and Iran. Trump has himself backed McMaster, saying he was a \"good man and very pro-Israel\".\n\nA source close to the ZOA bristled at the suggestion that Bannon was influencing its approach and said it would not tone down the campaign against McMaster, despite entreaties by Bannon to do so. \"We find it remarkably offensive that anyone would suggest that Steve Bannon or anyone else tells us what to say or what not to say,\" the source said. \"It makes me feel awful that he's getting blamed for this, but there's nothing I can do about it.\"", "id": "9600680", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Banish Bannon?

They're not shy about saying what they're doing. One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and it's gonna be them if we go down this path. On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow.\"\n\n\u00a9 REUTERS/ Carlos BarriaWhite House Strategist Says US at 'Economic War' With China\"To me,\" Bannon said, \"the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nThe White House Chief Strategist therefore suggested proceeding with tough trade sanctions against Beijing, complaining against China over alleged coercion of US technology transfers under Section 301 of the 1974 US Trade Act, which allows Washington to take action against foreign governments, and following up with complaints against steel and aluminum dumping.\n\n\"We're going to run the tables on these guys. We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us,\" Bannon said.\n\nSputnik Radio discussed the interview with Vladimir Vasilyev, chief research fellow at the Moscow-based Institute of US and Canada Studies, who said that Steve Bannon \"rhetorically exaggerated\" the urgency of the situation.\n\n\"This is the continuation of the same very rhetoric which is now being voiced about North Korea. So far, these are the empty words,\" he told Sputnik.\n\n\"When threatening that if Beijing does not pressure Pyongyang, Washington will unleash a full-scale economic war against China, Bannon is too hot to trot,\" Vasilyev added.\n\n\u00a9 AFP 2017/ STRIf US Starts Trade War, China Has an 'Arsenal of Retaliatory Measures'He then referred to the recent steps in the relations between the US and China. On Monday, US President Donald Trump issued an order for a possible US trade investigation of China's trade practices. He told US trade officials to look into whether Beijing improperly requires foreign companies to hand over technology in exchange for market access.\n\nAmerican observers said that this process might take up to one year. For now, any US threats remain empty words, Vasilyev said.\n\n\"This bag of words however pursues certain strategic and tactical purposes. Among tactical purposes, it is to exert psychologic and political pressure on China for it to influence North Korea,\" he concluded.\n\nMeanwhile on Thursday, American news and information website Axios reported that the White House Chief Strategist said that he did not intend \"to turn into a story\" the comments he made to Robert Kuttner by phone.\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo/ Ng Han Guan, PoolPressure Tool on China: How Washington Uses N Korea Against Beijing\"The White House chief strategist has told associates he never intended to do an \"interview\" with an editor at the American Prospect, a left-wing publication,\" political reporter Jonathan Swan wrote in his article for the website.\n\n\"Bannon has told associates that he admired the author's stance on China, and so called the journalist, Robert Kuttner, on Tuesday, to discuss his piece. Apparently Bannon never thought that the journalist might take his (very newsworthy) comments and turn them into a story,\" the author added.\n\nIn his other comments to Kuttner, Steve Bannon \"undercut the president's stance on North Korea,\" \"openly talked about his internal fights with colleagues,\" and \"talked about changing personnel in a way that made him sound like the president.\"", "id": "9684882", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "US at 'Economic War' With China?

Kuttner said media-savvy Bannon -- who was a topic of conversation during former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci's phone call with The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza, which led to his firing -- never asked for the conversation to be off the record.\n\nBannon told Kuttner there is \"no military solution\" to North Korea and its nuclear threats; said the \"economic war with China is everything\" and the U.S. must be \"maniacally focused on that\"; and called white nationalists \"losers,\" \"a fringe element,\" and \"a collection of clowns.\" He also made it sound like he has final say in staffing (\"I'm changing out people at East Asian Defense; I'm getting hawks in\") and discussed his fights with colleagues (\"There's Treasury and [National Economic Council Chair] Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying\").\n\nAxios' Jonathan Swan spoke with some of Bannon's associates, including one described as being \"not an enemy of his,\" who all saw this as a terrible move by Bannon. That person told Swan, after reading the article, \"Since Steve apparently enjoys casually undermining U.S. national security, I'll put this in terms he'll understand: This is DEFCON 1-level bad.\" You can read more about Kuttner's conversation with Bannon at The American Prospect.

Lee.\n\nA 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 other people injured when a man suspected of being a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters.\n\nMoves to remove statues honouring leaders of the Confederacy have gained momentum since the Charlottesville violence with monuments coming down in Baltimore and other cities.\n\nTrump, echoing remarks he first made earlier this week, made it clear he opposed the campaign.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" Trump said.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\" he said.\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" he said.\n\nLee and Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson were Confederate generals while George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were among the Founding Fathers of the United States.\n\nTrump critics were quick to point out the difference.\n\n\"Dear @realDonaldTrump: Robert Lee and Stonewall Jackson are not the same as Washington and Jefferson. Can't believe I had to write that sentence,\" said Ted Lieu, a Democratic congressman from California.\n\nTrump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, told The New York Times that he believed the president's views were shared by many Americans.\n\n\"President Trump, by asking, 'Where does this all end' -- Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln -- connects with the American people about their history, culture and traditions,\" Bannon said.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon said. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\nTrump on Thursday also lashed out at two leading Republican critics in the Senate and accused the media of distorting his views.\n\n\"The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is,\" he said. \"They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry. etc Shame!\"\n\nOn Monday Trump singled out the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis as \"repugnant,\" but on Tuesday he said counter-protesters in Charlottesville had been \"very violent\" and equally responsible for the violence.\n\nTrump's weak condemnation of the racist far-right set off a political firestorm across the US political spectrum. World leaders also criticised Trump's response.\n\nTrump was forced to scrap two White House economic advisory councils on Wednesday as top businessmen began abandoning him to protest his stance on the racial debate.\n\nThe president took aim at two fellow Republican senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona, in a series of tweets.\n\n\"Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists ... and people like Ms. Heyer,\" Trump said.\n\nHeather Heyer, 32, was the woman killed by the suspected white nationalist in Charlottesville.\n\nGraham had said the US president \"took a step backward\" Tuesday \"by again suggesting there is moral equivalency between the white supremacist neo-Nazis and KKK members who attended the Charlottesville rally\" and people like Heyer.\n\nTrump also blasted Flake, one of the few Republicans openly critical of the president, saying he was \"WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate.\"\n\n\"He's toxic!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nFlake, who is running for re-election in Arizona, wrote Tuesday: \"We can't accept excuses for white supremacy & acts of domestic terrorism. We must condemn. Period.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Bannon, attacked white supremacists as \"clowns\" and \"losers\" and described his efforts against administration rivals in an unusual interview Wednesday with The American Prospect, a progressive magazine.\n\nThe interview with magazine co-editor and columnist Robert Kuttner was initiated by Bannon, Kuttner said, in an Anthony Scaramucci-style phone call out of the blue in response to a column Kuttner had written on China.\n\n\"Bannon was in high spirits when he phoned me Tuesday afternoon to discuss the politics of taking a harder line with China, and minced no words describing his efforts to neutralise rivals at the Departments of Defence, State and Treasury,\" wrote Kuttner.\n\n\"'They're wetting themselves,' he said, proceeding to detail how he would oust some of his opponents at State and Defence.\"\n\nBannon was also asked by Kuttner to comment on the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville last weekend and President' Trump's reluctance to condemn the participants.\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element,\" Bannon told the magazine. \"I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, eh, help crush it more.\"\n\n\"These guys are a collection of clowns,\" he added.\n\nThe remarks were startling coming from Bannon, who spent more than four years running the far-right website Breitbart News before he was tapped to join Trump's campaign.\n\nBannon, the site's former executive chair, has called the Breitbart \"a platform of the alt-right,\" referring to the small, deeply conservative movement that seeks a whites-only state. It was his strategy to use the site to channel white supremacist support for Trump and provide a mouthpiece for his populist message during the 2016 election, a move that helped secure him a senior role in the administration.\n\nIn the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, which left a counterprotester dead and others injured, civil rights leaders have called on Trump to fire Bannon over his ties to the white nationalist community, as The Washington Post has reported.\n\nAsked by reporters Tuesday if he still had confidence in his chief strategist, Trump deflected.\n\n\"He's not a racist, I can tell you that,\" Trump said. \"But we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\"\n\nKuttner wrote in Wednesday's article that he was surprised when he got an email from one of Bannon's assistants saying he wanted to arrange a meeting. The two ended up speaking by phone on Tuesday afternoon, according to the article.", "id": "9733233", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump says US culture, history being 'ripped

it took the focus off of President Trump following his remarks on the violence in Charlottesville, Va., and shifted the media's narrative.\n\nBannon had a wide-ranging discussion with a writer for the American Prospect, a liberal magazine, during which he said there was no \"military solution\" to North Korea's nuclear development, and that \"they got us.\" During the conversation, which Bannon said he didn't know was on-the-record, the White House chief strategist said \"the economic war with China is everything.\"\n\nBut in an interview with the Daily Mail on Thursday, Bannon said his remarks \"drew fire away from\" Trump,\" and said he successfully \"changed the narrative\" with his phone call to the American Prospect writer.\n\nA White House aide told the Daily Mail that Bannon's interview has been well-received due to his criticisms of white nationalists and Democrats' focus on racism.\n\n\"The president doesn't like all the Democrats' focus on racism, and it's good that Steve mocked it as politically stupid,\" the aide said. \"Plus, distance from actual racists is a good thing.\"\n\nDuring his discussion with the American Prospect, published Wednesday, Bannon

He believes prophecy destines America to a 'trial by fire'. But now a blow-torch is being applied to alt-right banner man Steve Bannon's extreme beliefs.\n\nHe was the man credited with saving Trump's presidential campaign. Brought in from the alt-right website Breitbart at the eleventh hour, Bannon's advice to pursue a hard-line populist message among disaffected white America helped win the way to Washington.\n\nHe was immediately rewarded with his heart's desire: a place on the United States National Security Council and the title of Chief Strategist to the President.\n\nHere the formal naval officer would hear the best intelligence American agencies had to offer.\n\nHere, the extreme right-wing news editor could shape his nation's interpretations and responses.\n\nHere, the 63-year-old believer of dark prophecy could influence President Trump's policies with his conviction the world is about to enter a tumultuous time of change.\n\nBut Bannon wasn't the only one to hold the president's ear.\n\nThe Republican Party, which provided the foundation and framework of President Trump's campaign, had an 'insider' installed as White House Chief of Staff: Reince Priebus.\n\nIt would immediately prove to be a clash of the old and new American right.\n\nBannon -- with the bumbling help of fired media director Anthony Scaramucci -- eventually proved victorious, toppling Priebus under a cloud of damaging leaks.\n\nBut it may have been a short-lived victory.\n\nNow machinations are in play to put Bannon's own neck on the chopping block.\n\n\"Bannon was widely seen as losing influence with the appointment of General Kelly to Chief of Staff, given Kelly's desire to restrict access to the President and steady the Trump Administration,\" says Flinders University PhD Candidate in American Studies, Jesse Barker Gale.\n\n\"Jared Kushner, the President's son-in-law, has long been pushing the President to fire Bannon but Trump has resisted.\"\n\nIt's exactly the kind of conflict Bannon's world view believes to mark the transition to a new era.\n\nBut now the blame for Trump's fumbled response to the white supremacist demonstrations in Virginia, and the international shock at his blustering 'fire and fury' response to North Korea's missile tests, is being placed squarely at Bannon's feet.\n\nCATACLYSMIC CYCLE\n\nThe source of Bannon's dark vision of America's future is the book The Fourth Turning: What Cycles of History Tell Us About America's Next Rendezvous With Destiny.\n\nTime Magazine was told in a profile on Bannon during last year's election campaign of his wholehearted embrace of its message.\n\nIt's almost astrological in its assertion of simplistic cycles. It believes America's fate is tied to a supposed spiral of human behaviour that can be used to predict the future.\n\nIt's not a new idea. One baktun is the cycle of the Mayan calendar which supposedly predicted the end of the world in 2012. Spanning 394 years, each baktun was believed to represent a distinct 'age' or 'era' or civilisation.\n\nThe pattern that has caught Bannon's eye, however, originates with the Ancient Greeks. It's a cycle called a \"saeculum\". Like the baktun, the end of a particular saeculum would bring about the dawn of a new age. But each saeculum is made up of 'turnings' -- periods of about 20 years each -- which define a new stage of each cycle. The 'fourth turning' is the last phase before a cataclysmic change.\n\nFor some reason, in Bannon's mind, this Greek cycle of prophecy applies particularly to the United States.\n\nThe last \"turnings\" experienced by the US were The Revolutionary War, The Civil War and World War II.\n\nAll were sparked by an incendiary event. All had a period of regeneration. All led to disaster and conflict. All ended up in an era of reconstruction and new national order.\n\nAccording to Bannon's writings, he believes there must be a reckoning -- a cataclysmic conflict -- to bring about the new order he desires.\n\nThis involves war in the Middle East. And with China.\n\nThis could explain his behaviour during his eight months as chief White House adviser and National Security Council member.\n\nPAWN OF PROPHECY\n\nBannon believes the necessary 'catalyst' for a new 'turning' of the saeculum has already happened: The Great Financial Crisis.\n\nThe book behind his belief states a \"Grey Warrior\" will \"urgently resist the idea that a second consecutive generation might be denied the American Dream. No matter how shattered the economy ...\"\n\nEnter Donald Trump.\n\nBannon wants Trump's presidency to be the 'regeneration' era that leads to conflict with supporters of the 'old ways'. And he's working to shape it that way.\n\nCombined with his belief in authoritarian leadership and previous hard-line language on international affairs, and you have a disturbing picture of what has been working to direct White House politics and policies this year.\n\nBannon told his alt-right radio show, before joining the Trump team last year as campaign manager, that the United States was in an 'existential war' -- both in the Middle East and, soon, against China.\n\nIt's an angry, nationalistic world-view of conflict he embedded at the heart of his self-made films and his all-right news website, Breitbart: \"Our big belief, one of our central organising principles at the site, is that we're at war.\"\n\nIt's a bleak picture of present and future that has often been echoed in Trump's own words. Phrases such as the \"American carnage\" he referred to in his inauguration speech.\n\n\"Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation, an education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge. And the crime, and the gangs, and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealised potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\"\n\nWhile Trump claimed to have written this speech himself, it paints a bleak picture almost direct from Bannon's apocalyptic script book.\n\n\"Trump prefers off-script remarks, rather than the scripted statements he is often pressured to make,\" Mr Barker Gale says. \"The unscripted remarks, often on the topic of foreign relations or immigration or racism, are very much in line with Bannon's worldview and play to the constituency that Bannon has cultivated over the past years at Breitbart.\"\n\nDAWN OF DESTRUCTION\n\nPresident Trump rattled the world when he declared he was willing to hit North Korea with \"fire and fury like the world has never seen\".\n\n\"Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely.\"\n\nWas this reactionary posturing? Or an advised hard-line response?\n\nThe President's forceful -- and unexpected -- words reportedly took new White House chief of staff John Kelly by surprise. His fumbling, lacklustre response to the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, even more so.\n\nSo did the spark of an idea for this rhetoric come from Bannon? Does Breitbart's suddenly hard 'anti-appeasement' line have a White House source?\n\nIs Bannon behind the recent attacks on key White House National Security Advisor H.R McMaster over North Korea policy?\n\nThe president was quick to defend his controversial far-right chief strategist: \"I like Mr Bannon. He's a friend of mine ... He is a good man. He is not a racist.\"\n\nBut Senior Lecturer in Politics and Public Policy Rodrigo Praino says Bannon's beliefs send a clear message to the public.\n\n\"Trump doesn't understand that, in politics, symbols are extremely important,\" Dr Praino says. \"Bannon does not have any particular qualification, expertise, or experience that would warrant him his current role in the White House. His presence there is a nod to the alt-right, and this sends a very clear message to the public about where the President stands in terms of supporting this extremist group.\"\n\nEND TIMES\n\nBannon only recently emerged triumphant from an internal White House power struggle with former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. But new Chief of Staff, retired General Kelly, laid down the law with Trump before accepting the job that he had final say on who said what, and when.\n\nLittle surprise, then, that Bannon's future appears to have taken an abrupt about-face.\n\nWhite House National Security Advisor Lt General H.R. McMaster has refused to say he can work with his security council colleague. Scaramucci -- after doing him such a favour with Preibus -- has lashed him publicly as a white nationalist.\n\nAll the while, replacement White House Chief of Staff General John F. Kelly has remained publicly silent on Bannon.\n\nBannon insists his job is safe. But White House leaks suggest a very different scene behind closed doors. These mutterings suggest Kelly will not tolerate Bannon's machinations, manipulative leaks and direct disobedience.\n\nSomething has changed.\n\nBannon, once a fixture in every Oval Office gathering, has not been seen in recent days. Though he has apparently kept the President's ear -- reportedly advising him on how to respond to the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and North Korea.\n\nBut his advice -- not to antagonise his far-right power base, and to ram a hard-line home on Kim Jong-un -- appears to have backfired.\n\nIn a big way.\n\nTrump hasn't had an easy relationship with Bannon. He resented the way his 2016 victory was attributed to his campaign adviser. He also bristles at suggestions Bannon is his puppet-master.\n\nSuddenly, Trump has refused to rule out the disruptive proponent of the far right's agenda will remain in the White House beyond the week.\n\n\"The difficulty for Trump is that (key Republican campaign donors) Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah Mercer have deep ties to Bannon and are critical for future Republican campaigns,\" Mr Barker Gale says.\n\n\"Any attempt to oust Bannon would play poorly for future campaigns, and Bannon would be free to return to Breitbart News and push stories about White House dysfunction. Added to this is Trump's desire to aggressively confront what he sees as unfair criticism from the news media with regard to any number of issues.\n\n\"Thus Bannon is integral to Trump maintaining his base. He is kept on not because he is a policy expert or integral to the functioning of American democracy, but rather because the Trump Administration is afraid of what trouble he might stir up on the outside.\"", "id": "9603224", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Dark prophecy driving Steve Bannon", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0239bf3dea170b6707aa406b30bd04a2",

Or is he showing himself the door?\n\n\"I don't think Bannon's behind it for a number of reasons,\" Mike Cernovich, the right-wing media personality and former pizza truther, told me recently, describing the alleged feud between Steve Bannon, the president's chief strategist, and H.R. McMaster, his national security adviser. For days, the conservative universe had been self-immolating over a series of extremely negative stories about McMaster in Breitbart, Bannon's former organ. The beef fit the broad contours of a presumed narrative of spite and ideological confrontation. Bannon, after all, is a self-proclaimed \"economic nationalist\" who cautions against foreign intervention. McMaster, on the other hand, has been advocating a troop increase in Afghanistan -- and saw to it, as one of his first moves in his new job, helped to remove Bannon from the National Security Council. He later oversaw a purge of former Michael Flynn acolytes from the N.S.C., too, removing the vestiges of his nationalist-minded predecessor, who remains a hero in the world of anti-globalist agitators. But Cernovich wasn't buying that Bannon was behind the bad press. And he had some valid proof. \"Number one, it's cause I've been one of the people behind it and I've never talked to him,\" he told me. \"I don't think he wants this public beef because he's going to be framed for it. These beefs, all they do is antagonize Trump.\"\n\nRumors of Bannon's ouster from Trumpworld began circulating from essentially the moment that he joined it. One week after Donald Trump was unexpectedly elected president, Bannon, the messianic architect of Trump's national-populist campaign, was high on his own supply. \"Darkness is good,\" he effused in a giddy, wide-eyed interview with The Hollywood Reporter in Trump Tower. \"Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That's power.\" Conservatives, he predicted, would \"go crazy\" when they saw what the Trump Revolution had in store. \"We'll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and we'll govern for 50 years.\"\n\nNine months later, Trump's would-be svengali is isolated and alone in the West Wing as the president, on vacation in Bedminster, contemplates his expulsion. And despite the president's Breitbart-worthy waffling on whether to blame white supremacists for the recent tragedy in Charlottesville -- an apparent whistle call to the far-right -- Bannon appears to once again have found himself exiled from Trump's inner circle. His initial attempts to consolidate his power during the first two weeks of the Trump administration, and a spate of breathless media profiles of the White House chief ideologue, left Trump fuming. \"I call my own shots,\" he spat on Twitter. In April, he expelled Bannon from the National Security Council's Cabinet-level \"principals committee.\" One week later, he derisively referred to the anti-establishment strategist as just \"a guy who works for me.\"\n\nBannon laid low in the intervening months, forging alliances of convenience and notching small successes like Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate deal, to the horror of \"globalists\" like Gary Cohn and Ivanka Trump. And he survived a rolling staff shake-up that saw the purgation of Sean Spicer, Reince Priebus, and Anthony Scaramucci. But renewed allegations that Bannon has been leaking to the press have put him, suddenly, on even shakier ground. Trump himself has reportedly told associates he believes Bannon is undermining his colleagues. When Fox News chairman Rupert Murdoch recently urged the president to fire Bannon, The New York Times reports, Trump \"offered little pushback . . . and vented his frustrations.\"\n\nIn the past, Trump has been loath to move against the former Breitbart ringleader, or to personally fire anyone, for that matter. But with John Kelly as White House chief of staff, the president might finally have someone to do the dirty work for him. Both have reportedly been upset by a vicious smear campaign against McMaster, launched in early August by a variety of far-right agitators and activists who accuse him of sabotaging Trump's nationalist agenda. Breitbart led the charge, raising suspicions that Bannon was supplying the dirt behind the headlines: \"NSC Purge: McMaster 'Deeply Hostile to Israel and to Trump'\"; \"H.R. McMaster promised Susan Rice she could keep her security clearance in secret letter\"; and so on. One particularly odious attack sought to link McMaster to billionaire George Soros, who is frequently portrayed as a sort of globalist puppeteer on the far right. Outside of Breitbart, other outlets piled on: InfoWars accused McMaster of \"leaking intel to Soros almost daily,\" while Cernovich urged his followers to submit dirt to McMasterLeaks.com. Scurrilous rumors that McMaster has a drinking problem floated around the periphery.\n\nBannon has insisted that he had nothing to do with the anti-McMaster campaign. Denizens of the Breitbart diaspora agree. Lee Stranahan, a former Breitbart reporter, current Sputnik host, and fellow force behind #FireMcMaster, told me that he believed the \"deep state\" was actually the ones pushing this narrative -- not McMaster specifically, but the intelligence community and the career civil servants who allegedly want Bannon gone. \"They're clearly getting stories planted, which, whatever. That's the game. I get it,\" he told me. Patrick Howley, a former Breitbart reporter who now runs Big League Politics, also described the effort to oust Bannon as the product of shadowy forces. \"Really, what it is, is [them] just trying to push the president away from the things that he actually believes in and making him even more marginalized in his own White House,\" he told me. \"I'm not concerned about [Bannon's] relationship with the president. What I'm concerned about is, is it really possible for someone like President Trump to be able to come in and drain the swamp and win these battles?\"\n\nNobody I spoke to, however, thought that Bannon needed to remain in the White House to influence the president. On the contrary, multiple people told me that they thought the chief strategist would be more powerful on the outside, where he could return to his previous role as a conservative media bomb-thrower. Whether Bannon himself has such a strategy in mind is another matter. Stranahan claimed that he knew of several people within Breitbart who had e-mailed Bannon suggesting that he return to the company, though their e-mails went unanswered. And Cernovich had an even more trollish answer: \"It's in my selfish interest for Bannon to get fired, actually,\" he said, adding that he missed the hell-raising Bannon of old. \"It would be a lot more fun if Bannon were back in the game, as it were.\"", "id": "9817739", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Inside the Plot to Oust Steve Bannon", "image":

WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT.\n\nMore videos Journalist discusses Bannon's rogue interview\n\nIn an interview with The American Prospect, Steve Bannon said there's no military solution to North Korea and described the white supremacist movement as \"a collection of clowns.\" The journalist who spoke with him talked about their chat.\n\nHis views, delivered in a characteristically bomb-throwing style, have antagonised people across the administration, leaving Bannon isolated and in danger of losing his job. But they are thoroughly in keeping with his nationalist credo, and they have occasionally resonated with the person who matters most: President Donald Trump.\n\nBannon's dovish tendencies spilled into view this week in unguarded comments he made about North Korea to a liberal publication, The American Prospect. Days after Trump threatened to rain \"fire and fury\" on the North Korean government if it did not curb its belligerent behaviour, Bannon said, \"There's no military solution here; forget it.\n\nRelated Articles Think what you want about Bannon, but he's got a good point on China Bannon calls supremacists 'clowns', contradicts Trump on North Korea\n\n\"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about,\" Bannon said in a phone call with Robert Kuttner, The American Prospect's co-editor.\n\nBannon was saying what virtually every military commander believes - that a strike on North Korea would prompt overwhelming retaliation with untenable casualties in one of the world's largest cities. In this case, though, his comments undercut not only the President, but also decades of US deterrence on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that was not all: Bannon floated an unorthodox proposal for the United States to withdraw its troops from South Korea in return for China's commitment to get the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, to agree to a verifiable freeze in his nuclear and missile programs.\n\nYou will now receive updates from Breaking News Alert Breaking News Alert\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\nSuch a plan is not likely to gain traction, any more than Bannon's proposal that the United States substitute mercenaries for soldiers in Afghanistan. But his ideas have shaken up White House debates that would otherwise be dominated by the retired and active-duty generals who lead Trump's national security team.\n\nBannon's hard questions about America's future in Afghanistan stalled a policy debate that appeared on a fast track to a multiyear commitment of US troops. They sowed doubts with Trump, who repeatedly called for the United States to withdraw from Afghanistan as a private citizen and said almost nothing about the war during his presidential campaign.\n\nOn Friday last week, Trump will convene his staff at Camp David to deliberate over the policy, which Defence Secretary Jim Mattis once promised would be finished by the middle of last month.\n\nBannon pressed Mattis to consider the use of private contractors in a one-on-one meeting at the Pentagon last month. He sharply challenged proposals drawn up by the National Security Adviser, Lieutenant General HR McMaster, for the United States to keep several thousand troops based in Afghanistan and to work closely with the Afghan central government.\n\nSpeaking to reporters this week, Mattis said the idea of using contractors - which was developed by two outside businessmen, Erik Prince and Stephen Feinberg, at the behest of Bannon -was \"part of the options being considered\".\n\nMattis added, \"the President's open to the advice of the secretary of state, and myself and the director of the CIA\" - a peculiar assertion to make, given that those three officials are traditionally the top-ranking members of the President's national security team.\n\nMcMaster has become Bannon's nemesis in the West Wing, the leader of what Bannon has described to colleagues as the \"globalist empire project\" - a bipartisan foreign policy consensus that emphasizes active US engagement around the world.\n\nBannon flatly rejects that philosophy. During the presidential transition, he was spotted in an airport by a New York Times reporter carrying a copy of The Best and the Brightest, David Halberstam's book about the United States' misadventure in Vietnam. \"I'm having everyone in the transition read it,\" he said.\n\nOnce Trump was in office, Bannon opposed the missile strike on Syria after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons on his own people. He has expressed doubts about sending more troops to Syria or Iraq. He is skeptical of US military intervention in strife-torn Venezuela, a prospect raised last week by Trump, who surprised administration officials by speaking of a \"military option\" there.\n\nTo Bannon, all these ventures distract from his grand project of reviving American manufacturing. He has devoted much of his time to pushing protectionist trade policies against China and other countries. To the extent that Bannon cares about North Korea, administration officials said, it is because he views it as an impediment to that effort.\n\nTrump has soft-pedaled his trade talk against China to enlist its support in curbing the North Korean government. Bannon has told colleagues that he believes China is manipulating the United States by stringing it along on North Korea. The White House delayed its first trade case - on the theft of intellectual property - for a week to secure China's support for sanctions against North Korea in the United Nations Security Council.\n\nBannon's fixation with China prompted his call to Kuttner - whom Bannon views as a like-minded China hawk - and his comments, in a conversation he believed was off the record, laid out his role in a bitter months-long battle over trade with Trump's economic advisers.\n\n\"To me, the economic war with China is everything,\" Bannon said. \"And we have to be manically focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we won't be able to recover.\"\n\nBannon said he was working to oust officials from the Pentagon and State Department whom he viewed as too soft on China. He singled out Susan Thornton, a career diplomat serving as acting assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. Thornton has won the confidence of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. During a public meeting with Japanese officials on Thursday, he made a point of shaking her hand.\n\nBannon appears similarly out of sync with the President on North Korea. But that could change quickly, too.\n\nWhile Trump rattled the sabers at Kim last week, he has previously expressed a willingness to meet with him. When North Korea backed down on a threat to fire a missile into the waters off Guam, a US territory in the Pacific, Trump acknowledged the move with a respectful tweet.\n\n\"Kim Jong-un of North Korea made a very wise and well reasoned decision,\" Trump wrote on Wednesday. \"The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable!\"\n\nNew York Times", "id": "9844783", "details": {},

Bannon, the swashbuckling former Goldman Sachs banker and press baron of Breitbart news who call himself \"Chief Strategist\" of Trump's historic campaign, is in deep trouble within the Trump White House.\n\nTo be clear, I am no fan of National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster whose globalist views and hires are negating the foreign policy the President ran on.\n\nI am one who had publicly defended Bannon from false charges of racism and anti-Semitism yet I have concluded he is a spent force, never being willing to spend his political capital to help his friends and in some cases helping empower the very Globalists he claims to oppose.\n\nIn fact, I rather like Bannon who has his roguish charm. I am proud to write for Breitbart and I did his SIRIUS radio show many times. His Libertarian-tinged world view is much like mine, yet we both understand the threat of Islamic terrorism and the consequences of open borders.\n\nI even named Steve one of the Ten Worst Dressed Men in the World in the 2015 Mr. Stone's International Best and Worst Dressed List. The tradition of the list was picked up from the late Mr. Blackwell and it's now in its eleventh year. Bannon was so proud of the award that he forwarded the link to his friends.\n\nIt is more in sadness than in anger that I conclude that Steve Bannon has failed to look out for the Trump constituency, while establishment \"never Trumpers \" line up for cushy jobs and prestigious ambassadorships. Not understanding that \"personnel is policy\", Bannon refused to fight for any of his allies or those who helped get Trump elected. It's as if Steve felt the grubby business of patronage was below him.\n\nSelf-promotion and ham-handed leaking have hurt Steve badly in the Trump orbit. There is no Karl Rove in Trump-World. Trump is his own man. He is not handled or managed and hates it when subordinates try to do so. He is his own strategist and correctly resents when others take credit for the historic strategy and win, that is really his alone. I don't deny that I have been honored to be along for the ride and that the President does listen to opinions, as he always has, but at the end of the day no one puts ideas in Donald Trump's head or words in his mouth.\n\nThe President is very angry about Bannon's vanity biography \"Devil's Bargain\", the subtitle of which is \"Steve Bannon, Donald Trump and The Storming of the Presidency.\" Every other page is a love letter to the brilliance of Steven K. Bannon.\n\nIn all fairness, all of the key elements of the message that elected Trump had been chosen and defined by Trump himself long before Mr. Bannon arrived at the Trump campaign for the final weeks of the campaign.\n\nThe able Sam Nunberg worked diligently with candidate Trump to help him package his views during the earliest stages of the campaign and Trump road-tested these themes and honed them. He never deviated from these core messages; the dangers of our immigration system and the Wall; the inequities at NATO; our flawed international trade deals that he saw destroying the American job market; the abuses of America by the Chinese, fixing our broken Veteran's healthcare system; opposition to costly foreign wars where the national interest is not absolutely clear. These were all planks in the Trump platform before Steve showed up.\n\nIronically Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, and Jared and Ivanka followed the exact strategy laid out by Paul Manafort before he left, which was coaxing the candidate to give a few speeches from the teleprompter where the facile Steven Miller was able to give Trump some rhetorical flourishes in expressing his chosen themes. It is important to remember that the message came from Trump not Bannon. A recent piece in the Spectator claiming it was \"Bannon's campaign\" is just wrong. It was always Trump's campaign.\n\nWhile Bannon bitched about Priebus privately he worked as a partner with the former Republican National Chairman including an embarrassing \"Abbott and Costello\" act at CPAC, the Conservative Political Action Conference held yearly outside of Washington in which Bannon covered Priebus' ass and they lavished each other with wet kisses. Meanwhile, no Trump campaign veterans were being hired in the Trump White House.\n\nBut it's far worse than this.\n\nBannon engineered the ascent of Rex Tillerson at State despite the fact that Tillerson's patron and chief influence is non-other than Condoleezza Rice, the neocon former Bush NSA Director and cheerleader for the Iraq war. Documents which leaked from the Presidential transition proved that Rice was Tillerson's advocate and that several other staffers she recommended where quickly hired at State. Perhaps this is why Politico correctly tabbed the rise of veteran Romney-ites at State. The Trump State Department has failed to excise the Soros control of a number of U.S. embassies and is currently leaning on the Hungarian government not to impede Soros toppling of that democratically elected government. Bannon delivered the Trump State Department into the hands of the Globalists.\n\nWhile Bannon chafed with the influence of Presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner, he would never oppose him frontally and he never even lifted a finger against the appointment of quislings like Dina Habib Powell and Goldman Sachs' Gary Cohen.\n\nBannon failed to push the President to use his most potent rhetorical and political weapon-Term Limits -in his current fight with the Congress. Bannon did nothing to dissuade the President from endorsing Mitch McConnell's candidate in the Alabama Special Election primary which sent the clear signal to Republicans in Congress that you can thwart the President and there are no consequences.\n\nBannon has also failed to tell the President about the single most potent weapon he has; FISA Court certification that Obama's NSA actively, illegally and unconstitutionally spied at least on 30,000 Americans for purposes of political espionage. These indictable offenses and their prosecution is the key to derailing the Deep State coup unfolding before our eyes, yet Bannon never mentioned the FISA ruling to the President.\n\nWhen Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio who was a strong and articulate supporter of the President and his criticism of our current Immigration policies, was indicted for civil rights violations of prisoners in his custody the Obama Justice Department made certain he was tried under the wrong statue to deny him a jury trial. The Justice Department illegally monitored the Sheriffs communication with his lawyer as well as improperly communicating directly with the judge during his trial Arpaio's prosecution is a political hit job and the governments misconduct in his prosecution are certainly grounds for dismissal by the Trump Justice Department. Steve Bannon never mentioned the case to President who was shocked to learn about Arpaio's conviction when he didn't know about his trial. All of Arpaio's phone calls to Bannon to protest his treatment by the Trump Justice Department went unanswered.\n\nDuring the campaign for President Donald Trump said \"I love WikiLeaks.\" Both the President and Steve Bannon know that no evidence exists that proves that Julian Assange is an agent of the Russians as our intelligence services insist mindlessly without evidence. In fact, Julian Assange is simply a journalist who is neither of left or right but who is appalled by the massive excesses and widespread violations of civil liberties that he has exposed through WikiLeaks. It is important to note that unlike the New York Times or the Washington Post no one has ever disputed the accuracy or authenticity of the material Assange and his associates have published. Just like the New York Times in the Pentagon Papers case or the Washington Post's Bob Woodward, Assange publishes information supplied to him by whistleblowers and other sources and the publication of this information is fully legal and within the traditions of American journalism.\n\nThe completely bogus charges of sexual assault against Assange in Sweden have fallen away, an obvious frame job called a \"Honeytrap\", which is a classic in British Intelligence history. Now, however, due to the harping of CIA Director Mike Pompeo ,the Trump Justice Department has convened a Secret Grand Jury to fabricate a criminal charge against Assange in the United States, despite the fact that Assange has violated no law and the US Intelligence services can't prove he is in the service of the Russians .Yet Steve Bannon has never urged the President to stop the outrageous investigation and potential prosecution of the WikiLeaks publisher- a case of a publisher (Breitbart) ignoring the plight of a publisher (Wikileaks)\n\nThe Bundys , the last of the ranchers working federal land in Clarke County Nevada and their supporters have languished in a squalid Nevada jail for 18 months, denied pre-trial release even though none have any prior criminal history. When the Bundy Family fell behind in payments to the BLM, the government launched a deadly Waco- like assault on the family farm with snipers, police dogs and SWAT teams. All of this was after the Clarke County Sheriff called by phone to tell Mrs. Bundy the FEDS had decide to stand down. The potentially deadly assault came seconds after she hung up.\n\nTheir first trial deadlocked. Now the Government is taking no chances, the Judge who won't release the men to their families, has ruled out the use of first, second or fourth amendment defenses. Judge Gloria Navarro, a Harry Reed picked Judge appointed by Clinton won't allow them to call witnesses for their defense. She won't allow the playing of the BLM radio transmission recording where the order is given to shoot and ask questions later. Has Steve Bannon brought up a review of the case and a Presidential Pardon for the Bundy's with the President? Not a chance.\n\nTough talking Anthony Scaramucci, whom I like and whom I think was treated rather shabbily, was, as I said, a political suicide bomber. He took out two RINOS: Preibus and Spicer. For this alone he should be lauded. Bannon was too busy covering for the hapless Priebus.\n\nBut Anthony's access to the President was a problem for the Generals with McMaster (who really is a dead ringer for the late Don Rickles), Gen. John Kelly (who reminds me of Al \"I'm in charge here\" Haig) and Gen. Mad-dog Mattis, the first non-civilian Defense Secretary in modern times forming a triumvirate of control.\n\nBannon helped the Generals oust Anthony Scaramucci. Someone told the President \"the Mooch\" had drug issues, ignoring that Scaramucci had to pass two drug tests to work in the White House. Then he was out! The brash New Yorker's access to the President was a threat to the Generals.\n\nNow it's Bannon's access to POTUS that is threatening to the Seven Days in May crowd. Kelly is tightening his grip. Now even Jared and Ivanka must go through Kelley to see the president and neither is allowed to meet with him alone. Cabinet members who call the President are forwarded to General Kelly. Kelly thinks Bannon's ideas are na\u00efve and too \"far-out' and blames Bannon for the recent Breibart attacks on McMaster. Now it's Bannon the Generals want out.\n\nThere is no reason for conservatives to be upset about the coming purge of Steve Bannon. He did a lot to help himself but not much to help us.", "id": "9779628", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Bannon's Time Is Up", "image":

At the time, critics charged that such an approach was fundamentally flawed because it gives others permission to lead.\n\nAfter watching the horrific white-nationalist, neo-nazi terrorist acts unfold in Charlottesville, Va., one probably could use this same phrase to describe President Donald TrumpDonald John TrumpAssange meets U.S. congressman, vows to prove Russia did not leak him documents A history lesson on the Confederacy for President Trump GOP senator: Trump hasn't 'changed much' since campaign MORE's approach to this crisis: Trump is \"leading from behind\"... from behind White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.\n\nAnd Trump's \"leading from behind\" approach has had a horrific effect. People like neo-nazis, white nationalists, and modern secessionists are taking the permission and are leading our country in a direction that, I fear, is putting our Republic at risk.\n\nAs we continue to watch President Trump lead from behind Bannon, we have gained two critical insights into the internal power dynamics of the Trump White House:\n\nMuch has been written about the imminent demise of Steve Bannon. And, yet, he has survived. I have believed that Bannon will only be fired if he ends up \"hanging himself,\" making his presence fundamentally untenable for the president. After all, he presents a deep risk to the Trump presidency if outside the White House. The only other circumstance in which I believed Steve Bannon would leave is if he can be assured that his policies and worldview will live on.\n\nThat is, at least, until I read about Bannon's phone call with Robert Kuttner of the American Prospect.\n\nThere are a few notable points from this interview. First, it was with the American Prospect, a liberal media outlet and outside of Bannon's usual media milieu. Second, the phone call included a lay down of Bannon's perspective on everything that is happening -- from ethno-nationalism (\"it's losers\"), to Trump's nuclear saber-rattling (\"no military solution -- they got us\"), to economic war with China (\"[it's] everything\"). And third, it was supposedly an \"off-the-record\" conversation that Bannon, a longtime player in the media, surely knew would be published.\n\nThese features of this remarkable phone call tell us three things:\n\nTrump certainly knows the deep damage that Bannon and his cadre can do to the Trump presidency -- it's all the support he has at this point.\n\nSo, perhaps one of Trump's goals at the Wednesday press conference was to provide himself cover with \"Bannon evangelists\" on the outside so that he can let Bannon go without losing their support.\n\nAnn Coulter's reaction following the Trump presser may show the effect that Trump was going for:\n\nThe big takeaway here is that it doesn't matter if Trump fires Bannon soon. He may have sufficiently ensured that his worldview is not going anywhere -- regardless of what Generals Kelly, Mattis, and McMaster want. Bannon and his allies have gotten Trump to fully commit to the \"Bannon base\" at this point -- completely limiting his ability to broaden his support.\n\nSo perhaps it is time for these three general officers, with stellar reputations, to resign. If not, they too will be \"leading from behind\" -- because staying on will give Donald Trump permission to continue along his destructive path.\n\nMoreover, the likelihood that Bannon's worldview lives on only increases when one considers the broader political context. President Trump has no major legislative achievements and failed to repeal and replace ObamaCare. He only has a total political loser (debt ceiling) and political Hail Mary's (tax reform and infrastructure spending) from here on out. Sad!\n\nThe safe bet is that the debt ceiling is raised and none of these other legislative actions are achieved. Democrats and key Republicans have demonstrated an unwillingness to work with Trump. Why would that change at this point?\n\nSo, with Trump backed into this corner, what's his next move? It's simple really: Continue to portray Democrats as obstructionists; incite all out warfare within the GOP; and deliver more \"Bannon-ism\" to rally the troops.\n\nTrump's latest campaign ad says as much -- labeling all who are opposing his agenda as \"enemies.\"\n\nYou think 2017 was bad. You haven't seen anything yet. Just wait for 2018. Next year will be an election season in which the GOP theme will be \"every man for himself,\" including Donald Trump.\n\nSo, what does this all mean?\n\nThe GOP, as we know it, is dead. And our Republic is at risk. We remain a fragile country. The sacred social compact that provides the juice for our democratic Republic to work is fraying and beginning to spark.\n\nSadly, more scenes like Charlottesville will occur because Trump has set out a nefarious trap in our fragile society. By continuing to condemn violence \"on both sides,\" this may actually incite new violence.\n\nThose on the far left are enraged about what happened at Charlottesville and now, with the president establishing a moral equivalency between the anti-fascist victims and the white-nationalist aggressors, this may be enough to incite leftist groups to strike back. When one perceives the system is rigged against you -- a notion further validated by the person who holds the highest office in the land -- that may be all that is needed to move an individual, or a group, to retaliate violently. Then Trump will say \"I told you so.\"\n\nTell me how this ends. I fear the response.\n\nThe removal of Bannon does not change any of the risks to our the country. Trump \"leading from behind\" has permitted uncontrollable, negative forces to be unleashed into our society.\n\nSome will say that there have been many other times in our history when our Republic was at much greater risk. I will concede that point.

Jazz wondered earlier why Steve Bannon is giving interviews at all, but one has to wonder why he reached out to the hard-Left magazine The American Prospect as the venue. While Jazz focused on Bannon's curious comments about North Korea, his thoughts and his contempt for the white nationalists who have backed Donald Trump is remarkable, both in itself and how Bannon chose to express it:\n\nI asked Bannon about the connection between his program of economic nationalism and the ugly white nationalism epitomized by the racist violence in Charlottesville and Trump's reluctance to condemn it. Bannon, after all, was the architect of the strategy of using Breitbart to heat up white nationalism and then rely on the radical right as Trump's base.\n\nHe dismissed the far right as irrelevant and sidestepped his own role in cultivating it: \"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more.\"\n\n\"These guys are a collection of clowns,\" he added.\n\nFrom his lips to Trump's ear.\n\nSo why not just push Trump to dismiss them after the riot and attack in Charlottesville? Clearly Trump didn't get advised to reverse himself on his Monday statement by Ivanka and Jared or John Kelly; presumably that was Bannon, although it might have just been Trump being his whimsical self, too. Either way, Bannon told TAP's Robert Kuttner that white nationalists might be losers, but they're awfully useful losers:\n\n\"The Democrats,\" he said, \"the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nPerhaps that's why Trump is still pandering to this collection of clowns this morning:\n\nSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You.....\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\n...can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also...\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\n...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nAhem. One can certainly object to the unlawful vandalism that has occurred in some cases; mob action is always dangerous and to be discouraged. However, other cities have chosen through the democratic process to remove Confederate monuments from public land, and Trump doesn't distinguish at all between the two. Their removal does not mean that they are being destroyed; some might end up in museums, others in cemeteries or on other private lands. It does mean, though, that the people in these cities have chosen to stop honoring those traitors who instigated an armed rebellion against the US in order to protect a feudal, racist, slavery-based economy. What's \"sad\" about that?\n\nThe last claim that these monuments will \"never be able to be comparably replaced\" is just silly, especially given what these statues memorialize. The removal of statues honoring Confederate rebels gives these jurisdictions all the room they need to replace them with monuments to other, more noble efforts, if they so choose. Perhaps they might replace them with native sons (and daughters) who fought with distinction against the racist Axis powers of World War II, for just one potential option. That'd be plenty beautiful, and much more morally justified to boot.\n\nAt any rate, the strategy doesn't appear to be working out well. Trump has Democrats, Republicans, and independents talking about how this White House panders on identity politics to the same \"ethno-nationalists\" that Bannon calls \"losers,\" which is empowering Democrats and isolating the White House. Maybe Trump should cut his losses with this \"collection of clowns,\" and start looking for better advice.\n\nUpdate: David Martosko got a chance to ask Bannon why he gave an interview to TAP:\n\nIn a freewheeling discussion with the American Prospect, the White House's chief strategist dished dirt on his internal disagreements with top economic advisers about an 'economic war' with China, contradicted Trump's position on the possibility of a military option to end a North Korean standoff and boasted that Democrats would lose elections if they continued to focus on racial politics.\n\nBannon told DailyMail.com that his remarks 'drew fire away from POTUS,' meaning President Trump, and that he successfully 'changed the [media] narrative' with a single phone call.\n\nEr ... how did that work out? In fairness, this strategy had almost no time to succeed, even if it was a long shot. Trump managed to draw it right back to the \"collection of clowns\" with his Twitter messages this morning. Maybe the White House should hire a communications director with some real authority to come up with effective strategies rather than having someone West Winging it.\n\nUpdate: I missed including the second of Trump's three tweets on the monuments issue.

Indeed, he has gone even further: In a striking admission, Bannon confirmed that he views the racial strife and turmoil unleashed by Charlottesville as a political winner for Trump.\n\nIn the first interview, with the New York Times, Bannon explicitly defended the portion of Trump's comments in which he seemed to defend the rallying white supremacists' opposition to the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Trump asked rhetorically whether this would ultimately lead to the removal of statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Here's Bannon:\n\n\"Bannon . . . said in an interview that if Democrats want to fight over Confederate monuments and attack Mr. Trump as a bigot, that was a fight the president would win.\n\n\"'President Trump, by asking, 'Where does this all end'--Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln--connects with the American people about their history, culture and traditions,' he said.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon added. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\nIn the second interview, with the American Prospect, Bannon (believing himself to be off the record) elaborated a bit more on this general theme:\n\n\"The Democrats,\" he said, \"the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nRemarkably, Bannon is gleefully discussing the political dividends that (he believes) Trump will reap from the fraught aftermath of racial violence that led to the burial of a young woman who was murdered for showing up to protest racism and white supremacy. In so doing, Bannon endorses the general view, also expressed by Trump, that leftist violence (\"tear down more statues\") is partly to blame for the ongoing racial strife, and defends Trump's drawing of an equivalence between statues honoring Washington and Jefferson on the one hand, and those honoring the leading lights of the Confederacy on the other.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Trump doubled down on this view in a series of tweets, calling efforts to remove Confederate statues and monuments \"foolish\":\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson--who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also . . . the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nNumerous historians have already pointed out the many problems with this equivalence. While Washington and Jefferson were indeed slave owners, they helped create the nation, while Confederate leaders sought to secede from it in order to set up a separate nation perpetuating slavery. Others have noted that the whole point of many of these Confederate monuments was to celebrate white supremacy during the Jim Crow era.\n\nUltimately, though, what is really significant here is Bannon's frank admission that he believes the current ongoing turmoil benefits Trump. To be sure, a more cynical, self-interested motive may be at work. As the New York Times reports:\n\n\"Mr. Bannon, whose future in the White House remains uncertain, has been encouraging Mr. Trump to remain defiant. Two White House officials who have been trying to moderate the president's position suggested that Mr. Bannon was using the crisis as a way to get back in the good graces of the president, who has soured on Mr. Bannon's internal machinations and reputation for leaking stories about West Wing rivals to conservative news media outlets.\"\n\nThere is ample evidence that this may help Bannon's standing with Trump. The Post reports that Trump--like Bannon--also believes his remarks reiterating that \"both sides\" are to blame for the Charlottesville violence will boost him politically:\n\n\"Trump felt vindicated after the remarks, said people familiar with his thinking. He believes that his base agrees with his assertion that both sides are guilty of violence and that the nation risks sliding into a cauldron of political correctness.\"\n\nWith the special counsel's probe closing in, and with his numbers sliding deeper into the danger zone, Trump plainly believes that valiantly defying the forces of political correctness (meaning the forces that want him to unequivocally condemn racism and white supremacy) will rally his supporters to his side. Bannon is clearly feeding that instinct, at least partly to shore up his own standing with the president. Neither, naturally, recognizes any obligations or duties on the president's part to try to calm the antagonisms that are being unleashed, and neither appears even slightly concerned about the damage they could do to the country, at a time when experts are warning that this sort of rhetoric could cause an escalation in white supremacist activity.\n\nAs Trump's new tweetstorm in defense of Confederate monuments confirms, he appears determined to keep feeding these antagonisms.

What the hell is Bannon doing? Is he \"daring Trump to fire him,\" as a former Breitbart spokesman, Kurt Bardella, told CNN's Brian Stelter?\n\nNothing of the sort, Bannon claimed, hours after the article was published -- he was playing the media instead. Bannon declared the interview a success in an interview with Britain's Daily Mail today, saying it \"drew fire away from\" the president because he had \"changed the media narrative.\"\n\nFiguring out whether the Trump administration is \"playing three-dimensional chess\" by pursuing a sophisticated strategy (paywall) to manipulate the media, Congress, and foreign leaders, or is just a vortex of off-beat advisors gathered around a man who acts according to his own personal whims has consumed much of American political coverage in the first seven months of his presidency.\n\nTrump's statements on the Charlottesville far-right rallies is the latest suggestion that he may be driven only by his own whims. But Bannon has demonstrated a capacity for long-term thinking, including his infamous whiteboard of goals for the administration and a cohesive, if somewhat unhinged, world view. His claim to have a \"strategy\" here, however, left many American media experts unimpressed, including Jay Rosen, New York University's veteran journalism professor.\n\nWhere did this idea come from that \"changing the media narrative\" is some kind of feat? Just say stupid shit. https://t.co/8nevsPIWkW Done.\n\n-- Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu) August 17, 2017\n\nHis interview also didn't change the media narrative much. Headlines about Trump today have been focused on Trump's tweets mourning the loss of Confederate statutes, the dissolution of his business advisory councils, and the mayor of Phoenix asking Trump not to come to his city for a planned rally.\n\nBannon might have a more self-serving motive than protecting the president. He had called the American Prospect on Tuesday afternoon, the magazine notes, soon after Trump's bizarre press conference in which he called neo-Nazis \"fine people\" but also wouldn't say whether he had confidence in Bannon. Trump is under increasing pressure to fire Bannon, The New York Times reported this week. So perhaps Bannon genuinely believed (or wanted to) that he could \"change the narrative\" and get back into his boss's good graces. Or perhaps he was indeed \"daring him Trump to fire him\"; as Bardella notes, if Bannon isn't fired after so openly criticizing White House colleagues, he looks hard to dislodge.\n\nHowever, Bannon's words seem to carry little internal weight in the Trump administration. In the interview with American Prospect, he singled out Susan Thornton, the State Department's senior person in Asia, saying he was \"getting\" her \"out at State.\" But Thornton's job is secure, a State Department official told Quartz. \"The Secretary asked Susan Thornton to lead in a very important role and he continues to rely on her to lead the State Department's diplomacy in Asia,\" he said.\n\nCohn, too, is not going anywhere, the White House said Thursday. \"Nothing has changed. Gary is focused on his responsibilities as NEC Director and any reports to the contrary are 100% false,\" an official told the press pool on background.\n\nRead full story", "id": "9748157",

Reporters will descend on House Republicans to ask them if they think a censure is in order. If they say yes, the pro-Trump Republican base will go berserk. If they say no, Democrats will cite it as \"proof\" that Republicans agree with him about the alt-right.\n\nThe odds of a formal censure must be south of 10 percent, although let's see what polling on presidential job approval looks like next week. It ain't good now, but next week probably won't be much different. Probably. In any case, if something did pass the House, it wouldn't read anything like Jerrold Nadler's fantasy here:\n\nResolved, That the House of Representatives --\n\n(1) does hereby censure and condemn President Donald Trump for his inadequate response to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia on August 12, 2017, his failure to immediately and specifically name and condemn the white supremacist groups responsible for actions of domestic terrorism, for re-asserting that \"both sides\" were to blame and excusing the violent behavior of participants in the 'Unite the Right' rally, and for employing people with ties to white supremacist movements in the White House, such as Steve Bannon and Sebastian Gorka; and\n\n(2) does hereby urge President Donald Trump to fire any and all White House advisors who have urged him to cater to the alt-Right movement in the United States.\n\nThere wouldn't be anything about Bannon or Gorka in a Republican-written censure resolution, but then there almost certainly won't be a Republican-written censure resolution, period. The way out of this jam for Paul Ryan, I assume, will be to propose a resolution about Charlottesville that doesn't mention Trump or censure at all but implicitly rebukes him. E.g., \"It is the sense of the House that white supremacy is antithetical to American values, that white nationalists bear chief responsibility for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville,\" and so on. After it passes, Trump will say, \"It's not a rebuke! I said all of that myself.\" Then he'll do another 15-minute riff about good and bad people on both sides.\n\nThe fact that Nadler would bring Bannon into this is interesting, though. He must know that Dems loudly demanding Bannon's head will only make Trump less inclined to give in by firing him. Maybe he's using reverse psychology, hoping/expecting that Trump keeps Bannon on and continues to take hits over him. This quote from a source \"close to the White House\" sounds like reverse psychology too, although from the opposite direction:\n\n\"The president obviously is very nervous and afraid of firing him,\" a source close to the White House told Reuters.\n\nThe source floated the possibility that Bannon could be demoted instead of fired, noting that he might turn into a harsh critic of the administration if he is forced out of the inner circle.\n\nTrump's too much of a cuck to fire Bannon, say the Bannon-haters, hoping Trump will bristle and prove them wrong. No way, say the people (left and right) who want Bannon to stay on for their own reasons. Trump must fire him to appease the left. Whose bidding will the president allow himself to be perceived as doing?\n\nTrump being Trump, yesterday's press conference may make him less likely to dismiss Bannon than he was before. For any other pol, firing him now would be an obvious PR move: Bannon once touted Breitbart as the platform for the alt-right, Trump is under heavy fire for not denouncing the alt-right this weekend, ergo booting Bannon to appease critics would be the obvious move. Trump will never concede a mistake, though, especially when it was a mistake he made by speaking from the heart, and Bannon's dismissal now would be interpreted as an admission that he erred yesterday. For that reason alone, purely to spite the anti-Trumpers, Trump may keep him around. And Bannon's taking full advantage of the opportunity. Per Bloomberg, \"A source close to Stephen Bannon, the president's chief strategist, said he was proud of the president's performance Tuesday.\"\n\nExit question: Are we destined for a media war between Fox News and populist-nationalist sites like Breitbart? Rupert Murdoch has reportedly been urging Trump to boot Bannon. If he's fired at Murdoch's behest, revenge would obviously be in order.", "id": "9616177", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "House Dems offer resolution to censure Trump over Charlottesville remarks - Hot Air", "image": null, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 910, "date": "2017-08-12", "amb": false, "textEnd": 925}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Reuters"}, "id": "302588", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}, "id": "302944", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fantasy"}, "id": "303768", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}, "id": "304050", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}, "id": "304059", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}, "id": "304323", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"}, {"label": {"eng": "Culture of the United States"}, "id": "304718", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paul Ryan"}, "id": "304743", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ryan"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "News conference"}, "id": "309070", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_conference"}, {"label": {"eng": "Reverse psychology"}, "id": "392495", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_psychology"}, {"label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}, "id": "394340", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Censure"}, "id": "420089", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censure"}, {"label": {"eng": "Unite the Right"}, "id": "515460", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jerrold Nadler"}, "id": "722748", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerrold_Nadler"}, {"label": {"eng": "Breitbart News Network"}, "id": "1268862", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News_Network"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alt-right"}, "id": "1268917", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 110, "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 401, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety Engineering", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety_Engineering"}], "time": "19:38:00"}

Bannon's remarks appeared to undermine the president's gamesmanship using threats of a military option against the North Korean regime.\n\n\"There's no military solution -- forget it,\" Bannon told the Prospect. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about. There's no military solution here; they got us.\"\n\nOne source close to the National Security Council told me, \"The president had the North Koreans really believing they could wake up to a strike, taking out their nuclear weapons and command and control facilities. Steve just blew that out of the water.\"\n\nPresident Trump has long criticized the Obama administration for telegraphing his military plans in fighting terror.\n\nAnother White House source told Newsmax that Trump is not angry with Bannon over his China comments or even his stand on Confederate monuments, a view they share.\n\nBut the disclosure of the most sensitive military strategy of the nation, even if it had been off the record, only forces Gen. John Kelly and others to demand his dismissal, a source said.\n\nBannon thought his conversation with the Prospect was \"off the record.\"\n\nOther press are hearing similar murmuring from senior White House staff. \"Sooner rather than later,\" one longtime White House correspondent characterized the probable firing of Bannon to me privately Thursday morning.\n\nNo one as close to a president has given such a controversy-laden interview since Office of Management and Budget Director David Stockman described to a magazine editor Ronald Reagan's tax and budget plan: \"None of us really understands what is going on.\" Reagan famously took Stockman to the woodshed but didn't fire him.\n\nBannon, already at war with the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner and his NSC adviser Gen. H.R. McMaster, may have overplayed his cards this time.\n\nJohn Gizzi is chief political columnist and White House correspondent for Newsmax.

He thinks he can play us. In his conversation with Robert Kuttner, Bannon has done it again.\n\n\"The Democrats,\" he said, \"the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nThat feeds right into the hand of some liberals who think that addressing what has been called \"identity politics\" or \"cultural issues\" is hurting Democrats, who should move away from those things and focus on economic issues.\n\nBut Bannon was very careful to leave out a big part of his strategy. He is the guy who expanded the reach of Breitbart by making it a home for racists and white supremacists. He is the one who wrote and fought for the Muslim travel ban. He's the guy that has a long association with AG Sessions, who is moving to dismantle affirmative action programs and purge voter rolls. He is also the one who is completely on-board with Trump's plan to \"deport 'em all\" when it comes to undocumented immigrants. Finally, he is the one who joined David Duke in being thrilled with what Trump said in support of white supremacists and Nazis this week.\n\nWhat I'm describing is a White House chief strategist who is 100 percent behind the racist things being said and done by the president. In both his previous career and in his current position, he has gone to great lengths to incite and inflame racism in this country. Then...when Democrats fight back, he accuses the left of being focused on race and identity while he is committed to \"economic nationalism.\" This is an age-old Republican game plan that dates back to the Southern Strategy. I can think of no more appropriate response than the one crafted years ago by The Who.\n\nOne might ask exactly what Bannon has actually done about economic issues since he joined the administration as compared to the racist policies he has pursued. The one big item that's been on the table is that he supported legislation that would have stripped tens of millions of Americans of their health insurance -- the large percentage of whom are Trump supporters. We all know that Bannon has spoken about a plan for huge infrastructure investment. But that one was going nowhere before things became strained between the White House and congressional Republicans. I find it hard to imagine that it isn't completely dead in the water right now.\n\nDuring his talk with Kuttner, Bannon railed about what China is up to saying, \"\"the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that.\" It's interesting to note that this is pretty much Bannon's explosive way of saying the same thing Obama kept talking about when he suggested that we needed to \"pivot to Asia.\" For the former president, a big part of that was negotiating the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement to engage our allies in Asia. But for Bannon, it means a trade war with China -- something that would do great damage to American consumers, who would be hit with much higher prices as a result.\n\nIn summary, liberals shouldn't get suckered into the game Bannon is playing. He has focused on inciting racism while pushing trade policies that would devastate working- and middle-class Americans.", "id": "9710443", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "A Response to

He's also a professor of social policy at Brandeis University. We were also joined by Joshua Green, a senior national correspondent for Bloomberg Businessweek and author of the bestselling book \"Devil's Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and the Storming of the Presidency.\"\n\nI began by asking Kuttner about how his conversation with Bannon came about.\n\nROBERT KUTTNER, The American Prospect: Well, I got an e-mail from someone at the White House who says that Mr. Bannon would like me to come into the White House and meet with him.\n\nSo, I double-checked the e-mail address, which looked legit, and I called the guy, and he seemed legit. And I said, look, I'm on vacation, but this is kind of a fast-moving story, so I would be happy to speak with him by phone, if he would like to.\n\nAnd what had happened was, he had read a column I had written the day before basically making the point that, because we have been so passive in taking on illegal Chinese trade practices, that Beijing now has a huge amount of leverage over us, where we want them to help us with North Korea, but the price for that is we have got to fold our hand in terms of taking a hard line with them on trade.\n\nSo, Bannon apparently read that and felt he had a soul mate, and didn't take the precaution of making clear whether we were on background or on the record, and called me up and sounded as if we were soul mates and best friends.\n\nAnd it was like I was part of a private strategy session with Stephen Bannon, which was really quite bizarre. And about two or three minutes in, I said to myself, oh, wow, he is not putting this off the record. And I'm certainly not going to mention it if he doesn't mention it.\n\nAnd, of course, the ground rules are that when a government official calls you and doesn't say whether it's off the record or on the record, the default setting is that it's on the record.\n\nAnd so, 25 minutes later, I have this astonishing interview, which I recorded.\n\nAnd he made it sound like he'd been reading my stuff for years and thought it was great, you know, the usual kind of flattery stuff.\n\nJOHN YANG: Josh Green, this is Mr. Kuttner's first time talking to Steve Bannon.\n\nYou have been talking to him on and off since 2011, I think. How does this ring true to you? Does this ring true to you?\n\nJOSHUA GREEN, Bloomberg Businessweek: Absolutely.\n\nIn fact, my introduction to Steve Bannon was much the same as Bob Kuttner's. I had written an article about Sarah Palin. And, all of a sudden, one day, out of the blue, I get a phone call from a staffer, saying, I represent a guy named Steve Bannon, who at the time was a conservative filmmaker infatuated with Sarah Palin.\n\nHe said, Mr. Bannon read your latest article and he would really like to get together and talk with you. In this case, it was at a movie screening for Bannon's film.\n\nAnd I met him. And he's a very interesting, smart, charismatic guy who had a distinct brand of politics that I thought was interesting and worth writing about. And so I got to know him and basically have been interviewing him ever since.\n\nJOHN YANG: Bob, you mentioned two bits that he talked about.\n\nHe talked about contradicting the president's strategy on North Korea. He said, \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about. There's no military solution here. They got us.\"\n\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that?\n\nROBERT KUTTNER: Well, I thought he was right on the merits, but the first thing I noticed was that this was not exactly the administration's view, certainly not Donald Trump's view.\n\nSo, I said to myself, huh, he's being rather incautious and he shows no felt need to defend his president, and he's just speaking his mind. And it certainly is not the president's view.\n\nJOHN YANG: He also talked about what he called ethno-nationalism. He called them losers. \"It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much and we have got to help crush it, help crush it more. These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\nROBERT KUTTNER: That was completely disingenuous, because, of course, he, as much as anybody else in America, is responsible for assembling this collection of clowns as a political force.\n\nAnd people like Bannon and like Trump, they say what they need to say, and if they contradict themselves today relative to what they said yesterday, well, that's how you do it.\n\nAnd if he's trying to ingratiate himself with somebody who's an editor of a liberal magazine, \"The American Prospect,\" he's going to say what he needs to say to try and persuade me that he's not such a bad guy.\n\nBut you have to take that with a ton of salt. And I think it's the usual dog-whistle stuff, where the alt-right is not going to think that Steve Bannon somehow has had a deathbed conversion and he now thinks they're bad guys.\n\nJOHN YANG: Josh, what do you think was going on here when he said those things?\n\nJOSHUA GREEN: I think that he was trying to impress a credentialed journalist and somebody he admires.\n\nHe and I -- Bannon and I had similar conversations in the research for my book. And I asked him, because he's often charged with anti-Semitism and white nationalism. I said, well, if you don't believe this stuff, why is it that you make common cause with these guys?\n\nAnd his answer was that, while the types of you see marching in Charlottesville are -- he called them freaks and goobers to me, he called them clowns to Bob -- were individually ridiculous people, collectively, they represented a political force that he thought he could script into his larger America-first nationalism, into Trumpian politics, and use them, essentially manipulate them as tools to carry out his political goals.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nJOHN YANG: Bob, he ended the conversation with you by saying that he was -- wanted to see you at the White House after Labor Day to continue discussion of China and trade. Do you think that's going to happen, Bob?\n\nROBERT KUTTNER: You know, I think, as long as Donald Trump is doubling down on the alliance with the far right, Bannon's job may be safe, because he needs Bannon to guide him through that strategy.\n\nSo, I am certainly not going to predict whether Bannon's job is safe, but I think the point is, a lot of other people in the White House may be furious at Bannon, but there's only one person who counts. And that's Donald Trump.\n\nJOSHUA GREEN: I agree.\n\nAnd if you listen to what Donald Trump had said in the wake of the Charlottesville attack, it has been precisely the sort of thing that Bannon says and believes, even though it's something that is galling to Republican elected officials, to ordinary Americans, to many advisers within Trump's own White House who are leaking to reporters their dismay and disgust, but don't have the courage to come out and say it publicly or do what they ought to do and resign from their position in the White House, if they don't agree with what Donald Trump is saying.\n\nJOHN YANG: Joshua Green, Robert Kuttner, you both have fascinating insights into this guy Steve Bannon.", "id": "9804476", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Steve Bannon gave an 'astonishing' interview to a liberal magazine.

He's a friend of mine. He's a good person and I think the press treats him, frankly, very unfairly.\"\n\nThe non-committal defense of his top aide -- whose position in the administration has reportedly been in peril -- came as Trump faced calls to fire the former Breitbart head, along with Stephen Miller and Sebastian Gorka, following a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend.\n\nTrump has repeatedly blamed \"both sides\" for the violence that engulfed the Unite the Right rally on Saturday and on Tuesday equated protesters with white nationalists -- some of whom, the president said, were \"very fine people.\"\n\nHe's faced widespread blowback for the defiant remarks, which critics say showcased who he really is and what he really believes: a man who rode racially-charged \"America First\" rhetoric to the White House -- with the help of Bannon.\n\nTrump brought Bannon onto his campaign August 2016.\n\n\"This is Trump going back to the nativism and nationalism that fueled his rise in the primary,\" Lanhee J. Chen, Mitt Romney's policy director in the 2012 race, told the New York Times of Bannon's hiring.\n\nDays after Bannon's hiring, Democrat Hillary Clinton gave a speech in Nevada to call out the alt-right that the Trump campaign had brought into the mainstream of American politics.\n\n\"Bannon has nasty things to say about pretty much everyone,\" Clinton said, citing several outrageous headlines he'd published in his tenure at Breitbart. \"This is not conservatism as we have known it. This is not Republicanism as we have know it. These are race-baiting ideas, anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant ideas, anti-woman -- all key tenets making up an emerging racist ideology known as the 'alt-right.'\"\n\nBannon has played a significant role in a number of Trump's most prominent initiatives since taking office, including his controversial travel ban.\n\nBut his outsize influence -- which had once earned him the nickname \"President Bannon\" -- and his slash-and-burn style have also put him on Trump's bad side at various points during his first months in office.\n\nHe's proven durable in past instances, but has reportedly spent recent weeks isolated within the administration -- and that's before a chorus of voices grew calling on Trump to fire members of his White House who are associated with alt-right extremism.\n\nSome reports have suggested that Bannon could be ousted by the end of the week. Though, Reuters reported that Trump is \"very nervous and afraid of firing him\" and may demote him instead.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump seemed to downplay Bannon's role in his surprise victory in November, saying he joined the campaign \"very late.\" While he declined to comment on the future of his embattled chief strategist, he defended his character against what he said was \"unfair\" media coverage.\n\n\"I like him,\" Trump said. \"He's a good man.

Even before these most recent contretemps, the future of the president's chief strategist Steve Bannon, known for his ties to the so-called alt-right, was being widely speculated on. By the time you read this, he may be gone. Or, he may have been promoted. Who knows?\n\nEven if it turns out that the Darth Vader of the West Wing is heading for the Trump administration's revolving door, don't be dissuaded from picking up Joshua Green's excellent book, \"Devil's Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and the Storming of the Presidency.\"\n\nBannon is not a likable character, but he is a fascinating one. Page after page, he's shown to be smart, strategic and as monomaniacal as Ahab. Before you reach the halfway point of \"Devil's Bargain,\" you'll wonder how great it would be if he used his powers for good.\n\nGreen is a veteran journalist and former Boston Globe columnist who has the benefit of having interviewed Bannon and his associates for a fall 2015 profile in Bloomberg Businessweek. He'd previously interviewed Trump for the same publication. Usually, Bannon is not a chatty cat; in fact, he makes Jared Kushner look like an auctioneer after two grande double espressos. But Green has a number of quotes from his subject that are expectedly pithy and also quite enlightening, and, along with other interviews and deep research, he's put together a holistic picture of how Trump won the election. In fact, his account of how Trump defied all expectations is the most comprehensive, objective and clear-headed I've yet encountered. He demonstrates how Trump may not have understood the theoretical grounding of Bannon's \"hard-edged ethno-nationalism\" but that he proved the perfect vessel for taking it public and at the same time painting a dark picture of modern-day America. Bannon also encouraged Trump to mercilessly hammer away at Hillary Clinton's email server, highly paid Wall Street speeches and the Clinton Foundation's finances way beyond what any other candidate would have dared do. \"Hillary Clinton was the perfect foil for Trump's message,\" Bannon told a reporter in the hours after victory.\n\nThe author takes us back to Bannon's formative years, and traces the myriad influences that turned this son of JFK-loving Democrats from Norfolk, Virginia, into the poster child for today's rising tide of populist, right-wing nationalism. From his lifelong adherence as a Tridentine Catholic (the type who attend a more traditional version of the Mass in Latin); the lessons he learned about the Muslims nearly conquering Spain 500 years ago at Benedictine College Preparatory School; and a turn in the Navy where he witnessed close up President Carter's bungled attempt to rescue the Iranian hostages, Bannon has always drawn his own conclusions. This last event was especially impactful, as Green writes: \"Anyone seeking to trace the pathogenesis of the Islamophobia that would grip Bannon thirty years hence can follow it back to Tehran and his time in the Middle East.\"\n\nAfter the Navy, Bannon attended Harvard Business School, and then set out on multiple careers -- on Wall Street, in Hollywood and, finally, as a conservative firebrand. It's an impressive resume. Then, as he reached middle age with millions in the bank, a special woman entered Bannon's life, and everything changed. Her name was Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhen she was first lady, Clinton famously alluded to a \"vast right-wing conspiracy\" that was trying to bring her husband down. Whether that network existed then or not is up for debate, but there's no doubt that people like Bannon turned it into a reality, and a thriving one at that.\n\nBannon would come to be involved in no less than four enterprises that were gunning to make sure another Clinton never reached the Oval Office. The most important being Breitbart News, a website that (though he may regret these words today) Bannon claimed was \"a platform for the alt-right.\" Green writes that running Breitbart made Bannon understand \"the exhilarating, galvanizing power of being the bad guy, publicly despised by those whom you profess to oppose.\" A film company and a research firm devoted primarily to finding Clinton dirt were also part of Bannon's portfolio.\n\nSome of these enterprises were backed by shadowy billionaire financiers Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah. They've bought into some harebrained schemes in their day (enumerated by Green), and Bannon became their Virgil, happy to lead them through the underworld of right-wing conspiracy theories and the growing anti-Clinton network.\n\nOne of Bannon's projects hit the jackpot. A book called \"Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich\" by Peter Schweizer examined the murky finances of the Clinton Foundation. The book found a very important audience in mainstream journalists, led of course by Fox. Cable news featured talking heads discussing the book's evidence and conclusions, and when it came time for Trump to rail about Clinton on the campaign trail in 2016, he had more than enough fodder.\n\nWhen it looked like Trump's candidacy was circling the drain, Green tells us that the Mercers, already with millions invested in his candidacy, ordered him to hire Bannon. And thus the two men came together. Trump found someone who encouraged his outr\u00e9 behavior, and Bannon found, as Green puts it, \"a blunt instrument\" with which to propagate and eventually try to implement a nationalist agenda seeking to increase national security and tighten immigration laws, reconstruct trade agreements to put \"America first\" and to deconstruct the administrative state.\n\nGreen takes us inside the Trump campaign during the various crises that arose, as well as on the nights he clinched the nomination and then when he was elected president. If now, nine months later, Trump is hesitant to fire Bannon, perhaps it's because he knows it was Bannon's playbook that carried the day.\n\nAfter reading Green's book, my takeaway is that both Bannon and Trump are driven by innate grievances, manifest as a constant voice inside that cries out when they perceive unfairness, especially perpetrated against themselves or that prevents the world from being as they feel it should be. When this happens, they strike out: Trump gives another surreal press conference or dispatches a few incendiary tweets, while Bannon works more systematically, playing to the electorate's worst instincts.\n\nSo much of the reporting on Trump and company has, understandably, been of the breathless variety. Green for the most part dispassionately lays out his case throughout \"Devil's Bargain.\" He does allow himself a few pointed conclusions at the end. One is that Trump's lack of focus and the growing number of controversies and investigations he's embroiled in will kill any chance of his pushing through Bannon's dreamed-of nationalist agenda. The upshot? \"It's hard to imagine,\" Green concludes, \"that Bannon and the legions he spoke for will wind up as anything other than the latest partners disappointed when their deal with Trump turns sour.\"", "id": "9651208", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Whether Steven Bannon's In Or Out, 'Devil's Bargain' Is An Enlightening Read", "image":

In this case, though, his comments undercut not only the president, but also decades of American deterrence on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nAnd that was not all: Mr. Bannon floated an unorthodox proposal for the United States to withdraw its troops from South Korea in return for China's commitment to get the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to agree to a verifiable freeze in his nuclear and missile programs.\n\nSuch a plan is not likely to gain traction, any more than Mr. Bannon's proposal that the United States substitute mercenaries for soldiers in Afghanistan. But his ideas have shaken up White House debates that would otherwise be dominated by the retired and active-duty generals who lead Mr. Trump's national security team.\n\nMr. Bannon's hard questions about America's future in Afghanistan stalled a policy debate that appeared on a fast track to a multiyear commitment of American troops. They sowed doubts with Mr. Trump, who repeatedly called for America to withdraw from Afghanistan as a private citizen and said almost nothing about the war during his presidential campaign.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Trump is convening his staff at Camp David to deliberate over the policy, which the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, once promised would be finished by the middle of last month.\n\nMr. Bannon pressed Mr. Mattis to consider the use of private contractors in a one-on-one meeting at the Pentagon last month. He sharply challenged proposals drawn up by the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, for the United States to keep several thousand troops based in Afghanistan and to work closely with the Afghan central government.\n\nSpeaking to reporters this week, Mr. Mattis said the idea of using contractors -- which was developed by two outside businessmen, Erik D. Prince and Stephen A. Feinberg, at the behest of Mr. Bannon -- was \"part of the options being considered.\"\n\nMr. Mattis added, \"The president's open to the advice of the secretary of state, and myself and the director of the C.I.A.\" -- a peculiar assertion to make, given that those three officials are traditionally the top-ranking members of the president's national security team.\n\nGeneral McMaster has become Mr. Bannon's nemesis in the West Wing, the leader of what Mr. Bannon has described to colleagues as the \"globalist empire project\" -- a bipartisan foreign policy consensus that emphasizes active American engagement around the world.\n\nMr. Bannon flatly rejects that philosophy. During the presidential transition, he was spotted in an airport by a New York Times reporter carrying a copy of \"The Best and the Brightest,\" David Halberstam's book about America's misadventure in Vietnam. \"I'm having everyone in the transition read it,\" he said.\n\nOnce Mr. Trump was in office, Mr. Bannon opposed the missile strike on Syria after President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons on his own people. He has expressed doubts about sending more troops to Syria or Iraq. He is skeptical of American military intervention in strife-torn Venezuela, a prospect raised last week by Mr. Trump, who surprised administration officials by speaking of a \"military option\" there.\n\nTo Mr. Bannon, all these ventures distract from his grand project of reviving American manufacturing. He has devoted much of his time to pushing protectionist trade policies against China and other countries. To the extent that Mr. Bannon cares about North Korea, administration officials said, it is because he views it as an impediment to that effort.\n\nMr. Trump has soft-pedaled his trade talk against China to enlist its support in curbing the North Korean government. Mr. Bannon has told colleagues that he believes China is manipulating the United States by stringing it along on North Korea. The White House delayed its first trade case -- on the theft of intellectual property -- for a week to secure China's support for sanctions against North Korea in the United Nations Security Council.\n\nMr. Bannon's fixation with China prompted his call to Mr. Kuttner -- whom Mr. Bannon views as a like-minded China hawk -- and his comments, in a conversation he believed was off the record, laid out his role in a bitter monthslong battle over trade with Mr. Trump's economic advisers.\n\n\"To me, the economic war with China is everything,\" Mr. Bannon said. \"And we have to be manically focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we won't be able to recover.\"\n\nMr. Bannon said he was working to oust officials from the Pentagon and State Department whom he viewed as too soft on China. He singled out Susan Thornton, a career diplomat serving as acting assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs. Ms. Thornton has won the confidence of Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. During a public meeting with Japanese officials on Thursday, he made a point of shaking her hand.\n\nMr. Bannon appears similarly out of sync with the president on North Korea. But that could change quickly, too.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump rattled the sabers at Mr. Kim last week, he has previously expressed a willingness to meet with him. When North Korea backed down on a threat to fire a missile into the waters off Guam, an American territory in the Pacific, Mr. Trump acknowledged the move with a respectful tweet.\n\n\"Kim Jong Un of North Korea made a very wise and well reasoned decision,\" Mr. Trump wrote Wednesday. \"The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable!\"", "id": "9797243", "details": {}, "date":

But the president keeps hanging on.\n\nPresident Trump is afraid of his senior adviser Steve Bannon and is scared to fire him, for fear of losing ground with his white-nationalist base, reports say.\n\nWith the arrival of Gen. John Kelly as Trump's chief of staff, it was rumored that Bannon would be removed. Rupert Murdoch of Fox News has repeatedly advised Trump to dump Bannon. Moderate Republicans are urging the same. And Bannon started the week looking like a goner. A Tuesday report by CBS News, citing high-placed White House sources, claimed he could be fired as soon as the end of this week.\n\nBut Trump has hesitated.\n\n\"The president obviously is very nervous and afraid of firing him,\" a White House insider told Reuters. Bannon, former executive chairman of the far-right Breitbart News, was instrumental in getting Trump elected by bringing the site's significant audience of white nationalists aboard. As the president's overall approval rating drops, he's reticent to alienate his base of hard-right supporters.\n\nReuters reports that Bannon has become embroiled in a feud with national security adviser H.R. McMaster, who has accused Bannon of planting negative stories about him in Breitbart.\n\nThat, the racially motivated killing in Charlottesville, and the president's calamitous reaction to it, does not make Bannon's job security any easier to read. The president could fire him to answer allegations that white nationalism has taken hold in the Oval Office, or -- as Monday's press conference showed -- he could double down.\n\nWhat is clear is that Gen. Kelly's arrival has not gone according to plan. Instead of instilling discipline in the president, Kelly has seen the most chaotic and damaging week of Trump's term, from his aggression toward North Korea to the disastrous press conference about Charlottesville, in which Trump claimed a moral equivalence between neo-Nazis and the anti-racism protesters who opposed them.", "id": "9617181", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "President Trump scared to fire Steve Bannon: Report", "image": "http://www.metro.us/sites/default/files/main/articles/trump-bannon.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Reuters"}, "id": "302588", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}, "id": "302718", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fox News Channel"}, "id": "302938", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Channel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}, "id": "303035", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}, "id": "303910", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rockefeller Republican"}, "id": "305188", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Republican"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Oval"}, "id": "305634", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oval"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chairman"}, "id": "305842", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rupert Murdoch"}, "id": "314336", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch"}, {"label": {"eng": "CBS News"}, "id": "316648", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chief of staff"}, "id": "318852", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_staff"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hate crime"}, "id": "322425", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}, "id": "332605", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}, "id": "394340", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "H.

We have to be maniacally focused on that,\" Bannon told The American Prospect in a jaw-dropping interview that covered everything from urinating on yourself to North Korea. \"If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nMany experts across the political spectrum say Bannon is right: China is beating up America economically, and neither the US government nor US businesses have done much about it for years.\n\n\"It's a weird day when I agree with Steve Bannon, but he's right on this,\" says Jennifer Harris, a China expert at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former top staffer in President Obama's State Department. \"Going back to George W. Bush, America's policy toward China has been to ask nicely. That has not panned out well.\"\n\nRelated Articles Bannon calls supremacists 'clowns', contradicts Trump on North Korea Steve Bannon under fire as Donald Trump faces calls to oust him\n\nTrump often points to the United States' $US310 billion trade deficit with China last year as the ultimate sign of a \"bad deal.\" But that's not the real problem. The deficit is happening mainly because Americans are shoppers, not savers. People in US buy too much stuff.\n\nThe real issue is the Chinese are pirating American ideas and technologies. In the 1990s and early 2000s, people were worried about China illegally copying movies, music and books. The stakes are a lot higher now as the world's top economies compete on groundbreaking technologies in cloud computing, robotics, artificial intelligence and gene editing. Whoever controls these technologies will dominate global business -- and more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"When historians look back at this period of history, they are not going to wonder why the Chinese were stealing US intellectual property or business practices, they are going to wonder why the US didn't defend itself,\" says Gordon Chang, an expert on the Chinese economy and author of The Coming Collapse of China. He thinks Bannon is wise to hit China now. The Communist Party of China is gathering for its big conference this northern fall that happens only once every five years.

CEOs were salivating at getting access to the largest market on the planet: 1.4 billion Chinese. But it hasn't panned out. China has deftly put up barrier after barrier to make it hard for American companies to sell in China. In the meantime, Chinese firms have profited and are now buying up American companies -- everything from W Hotels to Silicon Valley startups. A Pentagon report this spring warned that China is pumping billions into hot Silicon Valley companies that are working on cutting-edge military equipment.\n\n\"China is limiting market access for US companies in China, yet the Chinese wanted unfettered access to America,\" says Evan Medeiros, an Asian strategist at the Eurasia Group who served as President Barack Obama's top adviser on the Asia-Pacific region. \"We need to re-think China's very substantial access to investment in the US\"\n\nBannon has a battle plan ready, and he's already unleashing it. On Monday, the Trump administration launched an investigation into whether China is hijacking American business ideas under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. At the moment, China forces US companies doing business there to \"share\" their technology because they have to do a joint venture in order to operate in China. The Section 301 move is in its early stages -- an initial fact finding phase - but Bannon made it clear he plans to push this along.\n\n\"We're going to run the tables on these guys,\" he said in the interview. And he is prepared to do even more. He also mentioned bringing a lot more complaints against China for steel and aluminium dumping. On the campaign trail, Trump frequently threatened to slap massive tariffs as high as 45 per cent on goods coming from China to the United States.\n\nCEOs hated the idea. It would raise costs on American consumers, they argued. Bannon isn't going that far. Instead, he's targeting his actions to go after the deeper IP issues and how China subsidises many of its companies to give them a leg up against foreign competition. It would be a real wake up call to the Chinese, experts say.\n\n\"We're looking at the most serious US trade action against China probably ever since China opened up,\" says Derek Scissors, a China scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute who helped advise the Trump Administration on the recent Section 301 move. Scissors has been calling for years for Chinese firms that have stolen US intellectual property to be banned from doing business in the United States.\n\nBannon's right to take the China threat seriously, but he's also been pushing policies that would be hugely detrimental to America's competition with China. First and foremost: Immigration, the process by which America attracts the people who come up with so many of the great ideas that America has and China wants. Trump's recent proposal to cut legal immigration in half and his failure to fully condemn the actions of white supremacist groups this weekend are being read around the world as a \"You're not welcome here\" sign. That's not going to help America win the global talent wars.\n\nWhether Bannon can put his ideas into practice is another question, as there are vested interests in at least parts of the status quo.\n\nThe biggest obstacle Bannon faces in his quest to go after China is what he calls the \"Wall Street lobby.\" Trump's top economic advisers - Gary Cohn at the National Economic Council and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin - are former Goldman Sachs executives who don't want a trade war with China or anybody else. Scissors saw the tensions first-hand. He described a lot of \"flipping around\" on what to do.\n\nFormer Obama administration staffers like Harris and Medeiros saw similar tensions play out in their time. They say the business community talks out of both sides of its mouth on China. CEOs complain that the Chinese government is restricting business opportunities, but when the US government prepares to act, CEOs warn of a \"parade of horribles\" that could happen like trade wars and even a recession. Harris thinks it's overblown.\n\n\"I'm actually skeptical that China will retaliate, especially ahead of the party congress this year,\" she says. The business community made the same huff and puff before the US put sanctions on Russia. \"We all woke up the next day and European banks didn't fail and the stock market continued to go gangbusters.\"\n\nBannon just might be able to get Trump to do what the Bush and Obama administration failed at on China. That is, if he can stay in the White House long enough to make it happen.\n\nWashington Post", "id": "9811873", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Steven Bannon: he's got a good point on China", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/x/y/y/4/i/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gxz4ck.png/1503024165131.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "120", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}, "id": "302593", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Business"}, "id": "302720", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}, "id": "302950", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "303540", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}, "id": "304051", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "304268", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China", "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "George W.

Scarborough's lie-telling his viewers and panel that Bannon had called President Donald Trump a \"blundering fool\" when Bannon never said that-was so blatant and obnoxious that he was called out by a conventional media reporter who has been on a roll of late publishing unfavorable stories about Bannon.\n\nScarborough and oh-so-serious sounding co-host Mika Brzezinski were discussing Bannon's Wednesday interview with American Prospect editor Robert Kuttner. Bannon called Kuttner because he saw in him an ally on trade policy, but the left-wing editor's past criticisms of Trump's North Korea rhetoric also made headlines. Last week, Kuttner wrote that \"the risk of two arrogant fools blundering into a nuclear exchange is more serious than at any time since October 1962.\"\n\nYet, Scarborough and his panel, which consisted of the usual suspects like Willie Guest, Katty Kay, and Eugene Robinson, spent nearly eight minutes droning on and on about how Bannon had called Trump a \"blundering fool\" to Kuttner when Bannon did no such thing.\n\nIt took Axios political reporter Jonathan Swan, who has been elegantly and efficiently promoting anti-Bannon spin of late, to correct the ignorant panel.\n\n\"I just do want to correct one thing that the panel was saying,\" Swan said after Scarborough finally brought him into the discussion. \"It wasn't actually Bannon that was calling Trump the arrogant fool. It was the author of the piece.\"\n\nIf Scarborough is not illiterate, he could have been acting with malice to lie about what Bannon did not say. Or, like many of his panelists, Scarborough could just be a poseur-the type who reads a few snippets and excerpts of a book or a long-form article before a dinner party and acts like he has read the whole thing while conversing with other guests who mistake sounding \"smart\" for having actual knowledge.\n\nSwan also undercut Scarborough's tired and desperate \"President Bannon\" taunt by saying that \"the idea that Bannon is some type of puppet master is not true.\"", "id": "9829244", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Busted!

But the former Breitbart News head Bannon has time and again avoided a dismissal even as calls for it intensified after Trump's reactions and statements to the protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend.\n\nThe president's decision to keep Bannon, who called his former news website a platform for the so-called alt-right, has perplexed many as Bannon's faced accusations of being a white nationalist.\n\nThe possible reason Trump has opted to keep Bannon on may be relatively simple: fear.\n\nTrending: Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial in Georgia Has to Go, Democrat Gubernatorial Candidate Says\n\nThe struggling billionaire president is reportedly scared that if he did send Bannon packing that he could become a vocal critic of the administration once free of its political inner-workings, Reuters reported late Tuesday.\n\n\"The president obviously is very nervous and afraid of firing him,\" an unnamed source close to the White House told Reuters.\n\nThe supposed fear stems from Bannon's influence over a nationalist Trump base that many have claimed handed him the White House last year, as evidenced by Trump's campaign promises of cracking down on immigration and renegotiating global trade deals that were labeled as more isolationist by critics.\n\nThere are also reports that even Bannon's allies in the White House are moving away from him, like senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and presidential assistant Julia Hahn, according to The Daily Beast.\n\nDon't miss: Amazon Stock Market Value Drops By $5B After Single Tweet By Trump\n\nThe fear could be real or not as many political operatives tend to gravitate toward media jobs following their departure, like former Press Secretary Josh Earnest, who is regularly appearing on MSNBC. CNN even announced after former Trump Press Secretary Sean Spicer stepped down that it would not be hiring him.\n\nIndeed, there's a chance that rather than outright firing Bannon, Trump could demote him to avoid upsetting the aforementioned base, according to the report.\n\nIt's a base that includes white supremacists and nationalists, as well as neo-Nazis, groups that Trump did not immediately condemn Saturday following the death of counter-protester Heather Heyer while saying the violence in the college town was on \"many sides.\"\n\nTwo days later, Trump specifically derided the hate groups in a press conference and condemned bigotry of any kind.\n\nMost popular: Global Deaths Caused By Militant Attacks Fall 20 Percent In 2017, New Report Says\n\nBut Trump later walked back those comments during another press conference Tuesday, during which he said the \"alt-left\" had also been responsible for the violence and accused the media of not accurately reporting it. Those comments brought new criticism on Trump and his administration, with reports indicating that the president was supposed to stick to discussing his much-anticipated plan to revamp the country's infrastructure but instead veered off on his own.\n\nTrump also said Tuesday that Bannon was a \"friend\" and \"not a racist,\" and that \"we would see about Mr. Bannon,\" who he denied speaking with over the weekend before and during the political fallout from the initial response to Charlottesville.\n\nFor now, Bannon's job appears to be safe, according to The New York Times on Wednesday, which also reported that the idea Bannon is pulling Trump's strings is wrong.\n\nBut the political infighting and media backstabbing that has taken place between Bannon and National Security Adviser Lieutenant Gen. H.R. McMaster -- and previously White House senior adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner -- has bubbled up so much that it could be greatly affecting the president's agenda.\n\nMore from

(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nPresident Trump's right-hand guy Steve Bannon has been called everything from a \"mastermind\" to a \"racist, anti-Semite.\" But regardless of what you think of Bannon, he just made a very good point about China.\n\n\"To me, the economic war with China is everything. We have to be maniacally focused on that,\" Bannon told The American Prospect in a jaw-dropping interview that covered everything from urinating on yourself to North Korea. \"If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nMany experts across the political spectrum say Bannon is right: China is beating up America economically, and neither the U.S. government nor U.S. businesses have done much about it for years.\n\n\"It's a weird day when I agree with Steve Bannon, but he's right on this,\" says Jennifer Harris, a China expert at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former top staffer in President Obama's State Department. \"Going back to George W. Bush, America's policy toward China has been to ask nicely. That has not panned out well.\"\n\nTrump often points to the United States' $310 billion trade deficit with China last year as the ultimate sign of a \"bad deal.\" But that's not the real problem. The deficit is happening mainly because Americans are shoppers, not savers. People in U.S. buy too much stuff.\n\nThe real issue is the Chinese are pirating American ideas and technologies. In the 1990s and early 2000s, people were worried about China illegally copying movies, music and books. The stakes are a lot higher now as the world's top economies compete on groundbreaking technologies in cloud computing, robotics, artificial intelligence and gene editing. Whoever controls these technologies will dominate global business -- and more.\n\n\"When historians look back at this period of history, they are not going to wonder why the Chinese were stealing U.S. intellectual property or business practices, they are going to wonder why the U.S. didn't defend itself,\" says Gordon Chang, an expert on the Chinese economy and author of \"The Coming Collapse of China.\" He thinks Bannon is wise to hit China now. The Community Party of China is gathering for its big conference this fall that happens only once every five years. President Xi Jinping has a lot to lose if tensions flare with the United States\n\nSince the 1990s, the mantra in corporate America and the White House has been that America needs to cozy up to China. CEOs were salivating at getting access to the largest market on the planet: 1.4 billion Chinese. But it hasn't panned out. China has deftly put up barrier after barrier to make it hard for American companies to sell in China. In the meantime, Chinese firms have profited and are now buying up American companies -- everything from W Hotels to Silicon Valley startups. A Pentagon report this spring warned that China is pumping billions into hot Silicon Valley companies that are working on cutting-edge military equipment.\n\n\"China is limiting market access for U.S. companies in China, yet the Chinese wanted unfettered access to America,\" says Evan Medeiros, an Asian strategist at the Eurasia Group who served as President Obama's top adviser on the Asia-Pacific region. \"We need to re-think China's very substantial access to investment in the U.S.\"\n\nBannon has a battle plan ready, and he's already unleashing it. On Monday, the Trump administration launched an investigation into whether China is hijacking American business ideas under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. At the moment, China forces U.S. companies doing business there to \"share\" their technology because they have to do a joint venture in order to operate in China. The Section 301 move is in its early stages -- an initial fact finding phase -- but Bannon made it clear he plans to push this along.\n\n\"We're going to run the tables on these guys,\" he said in the interview. And he is prepared to do even more. He also mentioned bringing a lot more complaints against China for steel and aluminium dumping. On the campaign trail, Trump frequently threatened to slap massive tariffs as high as 45 percent on goods coming from China to the United States. CEOs hated the idea. It would raise costs on American consumers, they argued. Bannon isn't going that far. Instead, he's targeting his actions to go after the deeper IP issues and how China subsidizes many of its companies to give them a leg up against foreign comeptition. It would be a real wake up call to the Chinese, experts say.\n\n\"We're looking at the most serious U.S. trade action against China probably ever since China opened up,\" says Derek Scissors, a China scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute who helped advise the Trump Administration on the recent Section 301 move. Scissors has been calling for years for Chinese firms that have stolen U.S. intellectual property to be banned from doing business in the United States.\n\nBannon's right to take the China threat seriously, but he's also been pushing policies that would be hugely detrimental to America's competition with China. First and foremost: Immigration, the process by which America attracts the people who come up with so many of the great ideas that America has and China wants. Trump's recent proposal to cut legal immigration in half and his failure to fully condemn the actions of white supremacist groups this weekend are being read around the world as a \"You're not welcome here\" sign. That's not going to help America win the global talent wars.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising part of Bannon's interview this week was when he called North Korea a \"sideshow.\" Trump had tried to do a deal with China: If Chinese leaders could contain North Korea's weapons program, then Trump was ready to look the other way on trade. Bannon thinks that's a huge mistake -- and so do a lot of people on both sides of the political aisle.\n\n\"I think Trump is making a strategic miscalculation. You need to tell the Chinese that both of these issues are important and both need to be addressed on their own,\" says Medeiros, who in the Obama administration.\n\nWhether Bannon can put his ideas into practice is another question, as there are vested interests in at least parts of the status quo. The biggest obstacle Bannon faces in his quest to go after China is what he calls the \"Wall Street lobby.\" Trump's top economic advisers -- Gary Cohn at the National Economic Council and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin -- are former Goldman Sachs executives who don't want a trade war with China or anybody else. Scissors saw the tensions first-hand. He described a lot of \"flipping around\" on what to do.\n\nFormer Obama administration staffers like Harris and Medeiros saw similar tensions play out in their time. They say the business community talks out of both sides of its mouth on China. CEOs complain that the Chinese government is restricting business opportunities, but when the U.S. government prepares to act, CEOs warn of a \"parade of horribles\" that could happen like trade wars and even a recession. Harris thinks it's overblown.\n\n\"I'm actually skeptical that China will retaliate, especially ahead of the party congress this year,\" she says. The business community made the same huff and puff before the U.S. put sanctions on Russia. \"We all woke up the next day and European banks didn't fail and the stock market continued to go gangbusters.\"\n\nBannon just might be able to get Trump to do what the Bush and Obama administration failed at on China.

Bannon, was among the very few top officials around Trump who quietly cheered as he resisted pressure to unequivocally lay the blame for the deadly violence in Charlottesville on Nazis and white supremacists.\n\nBut now Bannon has gone public with this view, in a pair of new interviews. Indeed, he has gone even further: In a striking admission, Bannon confirmed that he views the racial strife and turmoil unleashed by Charlottesville as a political winner for Trump.\n\nIn the first interview, with the New York Times, Bannon explicitly defended the portion of Trump's comments in which he seemed to defend the rallying white supremacists' opposition to the removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee. Trump asked rhetorically whether this would ultimately lead to the removal of statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Here's Bannon:\n\nBannon ... said in an interview that if Democrats want to fight over Confederate monuments and attack Mr. Trump as a bigot, that was a fight the president would win.\n\n\"President Trump, by asking, 'Where does this all end' -- Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln -- connects with the American people about their history, culture and traditions,\" he said.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Mr. Bannon added. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\nIn the second interview, with the American Prospect, Bannon (believing himself to be off the record) elaborated a bit more on this general theme:\n\n\"The Democrats,\" he said, \"the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nRemarkably, Bannon is gleefully discussing the political dividends that (he believes) Trump will reap from the fraught aftermath of racial violence that led to the burial of a young woman who was murdered for showing up to protest racism and white supremacy. In so doing, Bannon endorses the general view, also expressed by Trump, that leftist violence (\"tear down more statues\") is partly to blame for the ongoing racial strife, and defends Trump's drawing of an equivalence between statues honoring Washington and Jefferson on the one hand, and those honoring the leading lights of the Confederacy on the other.\n\nThis morning, Trump doubled down on this view his in a series of tweets, calling efforts to remove Confederate statues and monuments \"foolish\":\n\nSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\n\nNumerous historians have already pointed out the many problems with this equivalence. While Washington and Jefferson were indeed slave owners, they helped create the nation, while Confederate leaders sought to secede from it in order to set up a separate nation perpetuating slavery. Indeed, since Bannon brought Abraham Lincoln into the discussion, let's recall that Lincoln famously hailed Jefferson by saying that his authorship of the Declaration of Independence (\"all men are created equal\") had given voice to \"an abstract truth\" that would counter \"tyranny and oppression\" in all future times, including in the struggle to uproot and destroy slavery. Contra Bannon, Trump's absurd conflation does not \"connect\" with our history; it obscures it.\n\nUltimately, though, what is really significant here is Bannon's frank admission that he believes the current ongoing turmoil benefits Trump. To be sure, a more cynical, self-interested motive may be at work here. As the New York Times reports:\n\nMr. Bannon, whose future in the White House remains uncertain, has been encouraging Mr. Trump to remain defiant. Two White House officials who have been trying to moderate the president's position suggested that Mr. Bannon was using the crisis as a way to get back in the good graces of the president, who has soured on Mr. Bannon's internal machinations and reputation for leaking stories about West Wing rivals to conservative news media outlets.\n\nThere is ample evidence that this may indeed help Bannon's standing with Trump. The Post reports that Trump -- like Bannon -- also believes his remarks reiterating that \"both sides\" are to blame for the Charlottesville violence will boost him politically:\n\nTrump felt vindicated after the remarks, said people familiar with his thinking. He believes that his base agrees with his assertion that both sides are guilty of violence and that the nation risks sliding into a cauldron of political correctness.\n\nWith the special counsel's probe closing in, and with his numbers sliding deeper into the danger zone, Trump plainly believes that valiantly defying the forces of political correctness (meaning, the forces that want him to unequivocally condemn racism and white supremacy) will rally his supporters to his side. Bannon is clearly feeding that instinct, at least partly to shore up his own standing with the president. Neither, naturally, recognizes any obligations or duties on the president's part to try to calm the antagonisms that are being unleashed, and neither appears even slightly concerned about the damage they could do to the country, at a time when experts are warning that this sort of rhetoric could cause an escalation in white supremacist activity.\n\nIndeed, as Trump's new tweetstorm in defense of Confederate monuments confirms, he appears determined to keep feeding these antagonisms. And new polling explains why.\n\n* REPUBLICANS BACK TRUMP'S CHARLOTTESVILLE RESPONSE: A new CBS News poll finds that only 34 percent of Americans approve of Trump's response to Charlottesville, while 55 percent disapprove. Only 35 percent say his description of the events is accurate; 55 percent disagree.\n\nBut among Republicans, 67 percent approve of Trump's response, and 68 percent say he's describing events accurately. So, while the American people are broadly rejecting Trump's handling of the violence, Trump and Bannon may be right that it is rallying Republicans behind him, never mind what it is doing to the rest of the country.\n\n* AIDES WONDER IF TRUMP CAN RECOVER: A striking bit of reporting in today's New York Times overview of the latest in the fallout from Charlottesville:\n\nThe president's top advisers described themselves as stunned, despondent and numb. Several said they were unable to see how Mr. Trump's presidency would recover, and others expressed doubts about his capacity to do the job. In contrast, the president told close aides that he felt liberated by his news conference.\n\nOh. Well, as long as he feels good about all of this, then everything must be just fine.\n\n* WHY TRUMP REVERTED TO BLAMING 'BOTH SIDES': Politico reports that top aides to Trump say that he backslid to blaming \"both sides\" for the Charlottesville rally because he chafed at backing down:\n\n\"In some ways, Trump would rather have people calling him racist than say he backed down the minute he was wrong,\" one adviser to the White House said on Wednesday about Charlottesville. \"This may turn into the biggest mess of his presidency because he is stubborn and doesn't realize how bad this is getting.\"\n\nA big part of the story here is that at this fraught moment of national introspection, Trump seems to only care about whether he's seen to be capitulating.\n\n* SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT GROWS: A new Public Religion Research Institute poll finds Trump is viewed favorably by 38 percent of Americans, mirroring other polls. And:\n\nSupport for impeaching the president has increased significantly over the last six months. Currently, four in ten (40%) Americans believe Trump deserves to be impeached, up 10 percentage points from 30% who expressed support for this action in February.\n\nOne other tidbit: Americans believe by 49-43 that Trump has violated the constitution. Obviously, this is all the fault of #FakeNews.\n\n* TRUMP APPEARS TO ENDORSE FLAKE'S PRIMARY CHALLENGER: Good morning, Mr. President:\n\nGreat to see that Dr. Kelli Ward is running against Flake Jeff Flake, who is WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate. He's toxic!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nTrump is set to hold a rally in Arizona next week. It looks like he'll be endorsing Senator Flake's primary challenger. That should do wonders for relations with Senate Republicans.\n\nA LOT OF DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING IN 2018: Political scientist Seth Masket has a good piece reporting that relative to previous years, a very large number of Dems are running for the House, which boosts the party's chances of taking it back:\n\nWhat a large number of challengers does create is a better recruitment environment. ... Political science research suggests that the recruitment of high-quality candidates explains a good deal of election outcomes -- if a party can convince a large number of skilled and experienced candidates to run for office, those candidates tend to do better and the party tends to win more seats.\n\nThere are other structural factors that make winning the House an uphill battle, and it's still very early. Still, this is a good sign.\n\n* HOW REPUBLICANS CAN REALLY DISTANCE FROM TRUMP: E.J. Dionne points out that while Republicans are mouthing nice words of condemnation of Trump, they could also be taking meaningful actions to distance themselves from white supremacy:\n\nNow, for example, would be an excellent time for them to pass a revised Voting Rights Act and to end their voter suppression efforts. And let there be soul-searching in the party about racial dog whistles that exploit white resentment in ways more subtle than Trump's but still scandalous. Party leaders failed to reproach Trump unequivocally for his birtherist attacks on President Barack Obama. Birtherism was a first step toward Charlottesville.\n\nIt should be interesting to see how Republicans react to the \"findings\" of Trump's vote suppression commission.\n\n* AND IS THIS A 'PIVOTAL MOMENT IN TRUMP'S COLLAPSE'? Historian Tim Naftali makes an interesting prediction to CNN:\n\n\"Given the trend lines today, the Charlottesville episode is likely to be viewed by later historians as a pivotal moment in President Trump's political collapse and a defining moment in the history of the Republican Party. If it isn't viewed in those ways, then future historians may well be writing about a very different America.\"\n\nThat last line contains an ominous suggestion, but most signs are that the implied scenario here is not going to come to pass.

If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nOn Tuesday and again on Thursday the president made a decided effort to shift the debate from one about the acceptability of white nationalism - a gentle way of describing the racists, neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klanners who marched with torches and fought with counter-demonstrators last weekend - and onto more stable footing.\n\nA recent Marist poll shows that a majority of Americans support (62%) allowing \"statues honouring the leaders of the Confederacy\" to \"remain as historical symbols\".\n\nWhile the survey question was a bit loaded (the other option was to remove them \"because they are offensive to some people\"), the bottom line is clear.\n\nWhile Americans overwhelming reject racism and white supremacists, a debate over weather-worn statues cuts much more in Mr Trump's favour.\n\nLiberals will point out that the \"historical\" nature of the statues includes that they were largely erected in the early 20th Century, when southern states were codifying government-sanctioned segregation; that some of these \"beautiful\" statues, in Mr Trump's words, are accompanied by exceedingly racist text; and that local governments, reflecting the will of their residents, are the ones opting to remove the statues.\n\nThat is all well and good, but if that debate also means Democrats abandon bread-and-butter economic issues, Mr Bannon's side will welcome the exchange.\n\nMore than an issue of race, Mr Trump set up his defence of the statues as an attempt to protect a way of life under attack.\n\n\"You are changing history and culture,\" the president said on Tuesday.\n\nAnd in his tweet on Thursday: \"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart.\"\n\nWith his \"ripped apart\" imagery, Mr Trump is playing into the anxiety of Americans - explicitly about the anxiety over cultural change, but those sentiments go hand-in-hand with the financial uncertainty and upheaval that has wracked the nation since the Great Recession of 2008.\n\nThat was a central theme of Mr Trump's winning presidential campaign, an appeal to lower-middle- and middle-class voters who, even if they weren't personally devastated by the economic freefall and slow rebound over the preceding eight years, could see the chasm from where they stood.\n\n\"These are men and women who are, in the main, still working, still attending church, still members of functioning families, but who often live in communities where neighbours, relatives, friends and children have been caught up in disordered lives,\" was how New York Times columnist Thomas Edsall describes them.\n\n\"The worry that this disorder has become contagious - that decent working or middle class lives can unravel quickly - stalks many voters, particularly in communities where jobs, industries and a whole way of life have slowly receded, the culminating effect of which can feel like a sudden blow.\"\n\nMr Trump railed against change - a return to when America was \"great\". And the statue debate, as he's constructing it, snugly fits that theme.\n\nIn his interview, Mr Bannon dismissed what he called \"ethnonationalists\" as a \"collection of clowns\", but that view seems more an attempt to put his liberal interviewer at ease.\n\nElsewhere, Mr Bannon has boasted that Breitbart, the publication he used to head, was a \"platform for the alt-right\" - the anodyne term for the collection of white nationalist groups that have seen a resurgence in power and numbers as Mr Trump campaign gathered strength.\n\nMr Bannon needs nationalists of all stripes - white, economic, even left-leaning populists and anti-trade liberals like Kuttner - for the new political order he hopes to build that will be willing to wage an economic war against China.\n\n\"To me the economic war with China is everything,\" Mr Bannon said. \"And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nStanding between himself and a successful prosecution of this showdown are global elites, including establishment politicians, the mainstream media, financial conglomerates and even Trump administration officials like Goldman Sachs executive turned White House economic advisor Gary Cohn.\n\nIf these themes sound familiar, it's because they were interwoven into Mr Trump's presidential campaign, particularly after Mr Bannon joined the team in August 2016. They were also a central focus of Mr Trump's combative inaugural address in January.\n\nIf one squints the right way, all of Mr Trump's recent actions can be seen as part of this overarching strategy. There's the non-stop battles with the \"fake news\" mainstream press. The seemingly unnecessary fights with members of his own party, including Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell. And the recent announced administration probe of Chinese intellectual property practices, with promises of more trade actions to come.\n\nSquint another way, of course, and Mr Trump's strategy devolves into the fits and starts of a chief executive who reacts to perceived slights and counter-punches whenever he feels disparaged. The embrace of the Confederate statues is a response to liberal criticism of his handling of the Charlottesville unrest. The feuds with Republicans are because they won't do his bidding. The media-bashing is because reporters aren't treating him with appropriate respect.\n\n\"I think the president enjoys a scrap with the press,\" says Ron Christie, a former adviser to President George W Bush. \"I think he believes this is about him and the press and how he's going to beat the press. What he doesn't recognise is that the importance of being the president of the United States is to unify the country, to bring people together and to heal divisive wounds.\"\n\nAs Nancy Cook and Josh Dawsey write in Politico, Mr Trump's behaviour can be boiled down to a collection of anger triggers.\n\n\"White House officials and informal advisers say the triggers for his temper are if he thinks someone is lying to him, if he's caught by surprise, if someone criticises him, or if someone stops him from trying to do something or seeks to control him,\" they write.\n\nIf Mr Trump's actions are part of a larger strategy, and not a fit of pique, there is also the question of whether it's correct to attribute this to Mr Bannon at all.\n\nWhile he appears more than willing to take credit for the strategy, the larger themes of the Trump \"movement\" - border security, aggressive trade protectionism, immigration reform and a certain kind of cultural nostalgia - were well in place before his arrival, as Mr Trump himself likes to point out.\n\nMr Bannon may have given ideological focus to what was a flailing Trump campaign last August, but the raw material was all Trump's. And this week - as always - the man at the lectern, the man with his finger on the Twitter trigger, is the president.\n\nThe \"Make America Great Again\" slogan isn't Bannonism. It's Trumpism. But whatever you call it, that strain of politics is woven into the fabric of this presidency.", "id": "9820833", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Why Trump thinks he can win on race -

He then won a landslide victory on a straightforward platform of economic nationalism,\" Bannon wrote in an email Thursday to The Washington Post. \"As long as the Democrats fail to understand this, they will continue to lose. But leftist elites do not value history, so why would they learn from history?\"\n\nCharges against the president of racism, or at least sympathies for hate groups, have resurfaced this week in the wake of a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend that left one woman dead and 19 others people injured.\n\nIn both his initial remarks and at a press conference on Tuesday, Trump said blame for the violence should be shared between the white supremacist groups and the protesters gathered to oppose their presence, remarking that there had been \"very fine people\" on both sides. The comments drew a nearly unanimous rebuke not just from Democrats, but from Republicans as well.\n\nThe president waded deeper into the controversy Thursday, writing on Twitter that he opposed the removal of Confederate statues and memorials from prominent locations across the U.S., lamenting that it was \"so foolish\" and \"sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart.\" Last weekend's white supremacist rally had ostensibly been billed as a protest against the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nBannon's comments to the Post matched his remarks in two other interviews this week, one with The New York Times and another with a liberal magazine, The American Prospect. In both conversations, Bannon said Democrats' focus on race and cultural issues like the removal of confederate statues opens a lane for Trump to shine a spotlight on the economic issues and proposals that got him elected.\n\n\"The Democrats,\" Bannon told The American Prospect, \"the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" he said to the Times. \"Just give me more.

Considering the latest controversy, though, it's not evident that hoaxing on the fate of the planet will save Bannon's job.\n\nSteve Bannon was a founding member of the board of directors of Breitbart News. Upon the death of its namesake Andrew Breitbart in 2012, Bannon took over as executive chair of the site's parent company, Breitbart News LLC.\n\nTo get some perspective on the connection between Steve Bannon, Breitbart, and climate change denial, just follow the money. Here's a rundown assembled by our friends over at DeSmogBlog:\n\nThe Mercer family provided the initial $10 million to help Steve Bannon start up Breitbart News. Since then, the site has become very successful, outdoing the Huffington Post, and ranking as the 29th most popular site in America, The Guardian reported. [15]\n\nInside Climate News also has a good take on the Breitbart approach to climate science:\n\nStephen Bannon has called government support of alternative energy \"madness.\" His conservative website, Breitbart News, relentlessly pursues the idea that global warming is an invention of activists, university researchers and renewable energy industry profiteers determined to assert global governance for their own gain.\n\nAs for the connection between the Mercer family and climate change denial, that's a little more difficult to decipher. Unlike the notorious Koch brothers, the Mercer family fortune does appear to not lean directly on fossil fuels.\n\nThe $10 million that Mercer pumped into Breitbart in 2012 appears to be part and parcel of a broader strategy to support climate change denial with big bucks, as catalogued by DeSmogBlog:\n\nThe Mercer Family Foundation, led by Rebekah, has given heavily to climate science denial groups like Heartland.\n\nTheir latest $100,000 donation, declared in the Mercer Family Foundation's 2015 tax form, takes their financial backing of Heartland to more than $5 million since the first $1 million check was written in 2008.\n\nAs DeSmog has reported, the Mercers have also donated to several of the Heartland Institute conference sponsors, including the Heritage Foundation and the Media Research Center, which has received more than $13 million from the Mercer Family Foundation.\n\nAside from any direct financial interest in fossil fuels, climate change denial has the broad effect of undermining mainstream, objective reporting on climate science, so there's that.\n\nIn other words, it's possible that the whole climate change denial thing is simply a means to an end.\n\nIf the long game played by the notoriously reclusive Robert Mercer is to accrue more power to himself, then undermining the power and influence of mainstream media is a critical step along the way.\n\nWhere were we? Oh right, the latest Steve Bannon controversy.\n\nBannon's situation in the White House has been particularly fraught since last weekend's events in Charlottesville, Virginia, when the seeds of his enthusiasm for white nationalism burst into full flower.\n\nThe sight of violent Nazi cosplayers running amok in a popular tourist destination with fatal consequences was apparently too much even for Trump supporters to stomach. Even Trump's allies in the business world have been fleeing for the exits.\n\nRather than laying low, on Tuesday Bannon apparently thought it would be a good idea to reach out to American Prospect reporter Robert Kuttner to discuss Trump's China policy.\n\nPerhaps Bannon thought he was calling the American Spectator? Who knows?\n\nEarlier this month the newly minted White House Communications Director Anthony \"the Mooch\" Scaramucci found himself unminted after speaking freely to a random reporter, but apparently Bannon's attention was elsewhere.\n\nKuttner accepted Bannon's phone call as an on-the-record conversation and now Bannon's numerous in-house adversaries have another weapon to deploy against him.\n\nDo read Kuttner's full piece for some insight into Bannon's perspective on the white nationalists whose trust and favor he has so assiduously courted. Toward the end, Kuttner asks Bannon straight up about \"the connection between his program of economic nationalism and the ugly white nationalism epitomized by the racist violence in Charlottesville and Trump's reluctance to condemn it:\"\n\nHe dismissed the far right as irrelevant and sidestepped his own role in cultivating it: \"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more.\"\n\nIf you ever wondered what Steve Bannon thinks about all those folks who put their trust in Breitbart for solid reporting on climate change, you can probably start with \"clowns\" and work your way out.", "id": "9700007", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Tip-Top Trump Advisor

We have to be maniacally focused on that,\" Mr Bannon told The American Prospect in a jaw-dropping interview that covered everything from urinating on yourself to North Korea.\n\n\"If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\"\n\nGet The Straits Times\n\nnewsletters in your inboxSign Up\n\nMany experts across the political spectrum say Mr Bannon is right: China is beating up America economically, and neither the US government nor US businesses have done much about it for years.\n\n\"It's a weird day when I agree with Steve Bannon, but he's right on this,\" says Ms Jennifer Harris, a China expert at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former top staffer in president Barak Obama's State Department. \"Going back to George W. Bush, America's policy toward China has been to ask nicely. That has not panned out well.\"\n\nMr Trump often points to the United States' US$310 billion (S$423 billion) trade deficit with China last year as the ultimate sign of a \"bad deal\". But that is not the real problem. The deficit is happening mainly because Americans are shoppers, not savers. People in US buy too much stuff.\n\nThe real issue is the Chinese are pirating American ideas and technologies. In the 1990s and early 2000s, people were worried about China illegally copying movies, music and books.\n\nThe stakes are a lot higher now as the world's top economies compete on groundbreaking technologies in cloud computing, robotics, artificial intelligence and gene editing. Whoever controls these technologies will dominate global business - and more.\n\n\"When historians look back at this period of history, they are not going to wonder why the Chinese were stealing US intellectual property or business practices, they are going to wonder why the US didn't defend itself,\" said Mr Gordon Chang, an expert on the Chinese economy and author of \"The Coming Collapse of China\".\n\nHe thinks Mr Bannon is wise to hit China now. The Communist Party of China is gathering for its big conference this fall that happens only once every five years. President Xi Jinping has a lot to lose if tensions flare with the US.\n\nSince the 1990s, the mantra in corporate America and the White House has been that America needs to cozy up to China. Chief executive officers were salivating at getting access to the largest market on the planet: 1.4 billion Chinese.\n\nBut it has not panned out. China has deftly put up barrier after barrier to make it hard for American companies to sell in China. In the meantime, Chinese firms have profited and are now buying up American companies - everything from W Hotels to Silicon Valley startups.\n\nA Pentagon report this spring warned that China is pumping billions into hot Silicon Valley companies that are working on cutting-edge military equipment.\n\n\"China is limiting market access for US companies in China, yet the Chinese wanted unfettered access to America,\" said Mr Evan Medeiros, an Asian strategist at the Eurasia Group who served as Mr Obama's top adviser on the Asia-Pacific region. \"We need to re-think China's very substantial access to investment in the US.\"\n\nMr Bannon has a battle plan ready, and he is already unleashing it.\n\nOn Monday, the Trump administration launched an investigation into whether China is hijacking American business ideas under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act.\n\nAt the moment, China forces US companies doing business there to \"share\" their technology because they have to do a joint venture in order to operate in China. The Section 301 move is in its early stages - an initial fact finding phase - but Mr Bannon made it clear he plans to push this along.\n\n\"We're going to run the tables on these guys,\" he said in the interview. And he is prepared to do even more. He also mentioned bringing a lot more complaints against China for steel and aluminium dumping.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Mr Trump frequently threatened to slap massive tariffs as high as 45 per cent on goods coming from China to the US. CEOs hated the idea. It would raise costs on American consumers, they argued.\n\nMr Bannon is not going that far. Instead, he is targeting his actions to go after the deeper IP issues and how China subsidises many of its companies to give them a leg up against foreign competition.\n\nIt would be a real wake up call to the Chinese, experts say.\n\n\"We're looking at the most serious US trade action against China probably ever since China opened up,\" said Mr Derek Scissors, a China scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute who helped advise the Trump Administration on the recent Section 301 move.\n\nMr Scissors has been calling for years for Chinese firms that have stolen US intellectual property to be banned from doing business in the US.\n\nMr Bannon is right to take the China threat seriously, but he has also been pushing policies that would be hugely detrimental to America's competition with China.\n\nFirst and foremost: Immigration, the process by which America attracts the people who come up with so many of the great ideas that America has and China wants.\n\nMr Trump's recent proposal to cut legal immigration in half and his failure to fully condemn the actions of white supremacist groups this weekend are being read around the world as a \"You're not welcome here\" sign. That's not going to help America win the global talent wars.\n\nPerhaps, the most surprising part of Mr Bannon's interview this week was when he called North Korea a \"sideshow\".\n\nMr Trump had tried to do a deal with China: If Chinese leaders could contain North Korea's weapons programme, then Mr Trump was ready to look the other way on trade.\n\nMr Bannon thinks that is a huge mistake - and so do a lot of people on both sides of the political aisle.\n\n\"I think Trump is making a strategic miscalculation. You need to tell the Chinese that both of these issues are important and both need to be addressed on their own,\" said Mr Medeiros.\n\nWhether Mr Bannon can put his ideas into practice is another question, as there are vested interests in at least parts of the status quo. The biggest obstacle he faces in his quest to go after China is what he calls the \"Wall Street lobby\".\n\nMr Trump's top economic advisers - Mr Gary Cohn at the National Economic Council and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin - are former Goldman Sachs executives who do not want a trade war with China or anybody else.\n\nMr Scissors saw the tensions first-hand. He described a lot of \"flipping around\" on what to do. Former Obama administration staffers like Ms Harris and Mr Medeiros saw similar tensions play out in their time. They say the business community talks out of both sides of its mouth on China. CEOs complain that the Chinese government is restricting business opportunities, but when the US government prepares to act, CEOs warn of a \"parade of horribles\" that could happen like trade wars and even a recession.\n\nMs Harris thinks it is overblown. \"I'm actually sceptical that China will retaliate, especially ahead of the party congress this year,\" she said.\n\nThe business community made the same huff and puff before the US put sanctions on Russia. \"We all woke up the next day and European banks didn't fail and the stock market continued to go gangbusters.\"\n\nMr Bannon just might be able to get Mr Trump to do what the Bush and Obama administration failed at on China. That is, if he can stay in the White House long enough to make it happen.", "id": "9828545", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Think what you want about Stephen Bannon, but he's got a good point on China, East Asia News & Top Stories - The Straits Times", "image": "http://www.straitstimes.com/sites/all/themes/custom/bootdemo/images/facebook_default_logo.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "120", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}, "id": "302593", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Business"}, "id": "302720", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}, "id": "302950", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "303540", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}, "id": "304051", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "304268", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China", "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "George W.

(AP)\n\nUS President Donald Trump has plunged his administration into a new crisis in the defence of white hate-groups that go under various names and their cause, but his chief strategist Stephen K Bannon, who once ran a far-right news-site, has a few names for them as well: \"clowns\", \"losers\" and \"fringe elements\".\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism (white nationalists, in other words) -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it...help crush it more,\" Bannon told a liberal news magazine. \"These guys are a collection of clowns.\"\n\nBut Trump is willing to go the full length for them. After defending them at the now infamous news briefing at which he sought to blame \"both sides\" for the violence that led to three deaths in Charlottesville, he lent full-throated support to their cause in multiple tweets on Thursday.\n\nHe called the statues of Confederate figures who had fought in support of slavery during the civil war -- and are thus the target of those who want them taken down -- \"beautiful\" and that it was \"foolish\" to remove them. \"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart.\"\n\nTrump's support of white hate-groups has brought him grief from both critics and allies, even by those in his own Republican party. Some of America's top CEOs have resigned from Manufacturing Council and Strategy and Policy Forum, advisory panels Trump had launched with much fanfare, forcing him to shut them down pre-emptively to escape the embarrassment of being left alone in the room by fellow business leaders.\n\nEven military leaders have sought to distance themselves from his remarks, without naming him. \"The Army doesn't tolerate racism, extremism, or hatred in our ranks,\" General Mark Milley, chief of staff of the Army, tweeted. \"It's against our values and everything we've stood for since 1775.\"\n\nA key motivation behind Trump's flagrant appeasement of white supremacists appears to be politics apart from other reasons, as has been argued by Joshua Green in a widely acclaimed new book chronicling the rise of Trump as a politician and Bannon's role in his victory. Green traces Trump's race play to the birther movement , a fringe far-right obsession he adopted and high-priested questioning President Barack Obama's birth -- that he was not born in the US -- to delegitimise his presidency.\n\nThe Charlottesville protestors form his base and played a large role in his election -- as former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke reminded him recently -- and he may be craving their support especially as approval numbers remain at a historic low for any American president at this stage of their term.\n\nHis chief strategist Bannon was clear in the interview it was about politics. \"The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nBannon, whose position in the White House is matter of much speculation, might not have been speaking for Trump all the way. He differed with the president on North Korea, for instance, on the use of military option. \"There's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats], forget it\".", "id": "9759182",

McMaster, the president's national security advisor and is said to have an acrimonious relationship with Jared Kushner, the president's closest advisor and son-in-law.\n\nThe latest Gallup tracking poll shows Trump's approval rating has dropped to 34 percent, down from 37 percent last week.", "id": "9617943", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Donald Trump Is Afraid of Steve Bannon, and That's Why He Won't Fire Him: Report", "image": "http://www.alternet.org/sites/default/files/story_images/32175841170_f8e58ae0c5_z.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "218051", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Reuters"}, "id": "302588", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}, "id": "303035", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "Political campaign"}, "id": "303233", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign"}, {"label": {"eng": "White people"}, "id": "303415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"}, {"label": {"eng": "News"}, "id": "304070", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trump Tower (New York City)"}, "id": "304759", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_(New_York_City)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nation"}, "id": "308370", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}, "id": "311241", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}, "id": "332605", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Political consulting"}, "id": "337266", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_consulting"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jared Kushner"}, "id": "343065", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Kushner"}, {"label": {"eng": "Demon"}, "id": "348531", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Swastika"}, "id": "357315", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika"}, {"label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}, "id": "394340", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "H.

He and his chief policy consultant, Steve Bannon, are heroes to the white nationalists who precipitated murder in Charlottesville last week. To my way of thinking, the blood of the Charlottesville murder is on both of their hands.\n\nIt's despicable that it took the president two days to lay blame for this heinous violence at the feet of ultra-right thugs and their white nationalist ideology. Obviously, tragically, Trump did not want to alienate his base of support. That's a disgusting thing to consider, but it is true.\n\nFor Bannon, white nationalism is not a side project -- he has spent years spreading the pernicious lie that America's true heritage is white and European, and spreading fear that Western civilization is under attack. He made Breitbart \"News\" into the alt-right movement's most powerful tool via fear-mongering and hate-mongering. That is precisely why Trump made Bannon his right-hand man. It was Bannon who helped craft Trump's message of fear and hate, and it was Bannon who helped orchestrate the 2016 Trump rallies that frequently turned violent.\n\nWith the sudden ascendance of the alt-right under the Trump/Bannon regime, we now have nazis marching in our streets. And in Charlottesville, as in Sacramento, we witness them facing off against armed and armored anti-fascist foot soldiers.\n\nI understand the Antifa movement's motivation.

And as a New Yorker profile Monday revealed that \"Seinfeld\" co-creator Larry David is very unhappy that the former Breitbart News boss benefited financially from the show's success.\n\n\"I don't think I ever heard of him until he surfaced with the Trump campaign and I had no idea that he was profiting from the work of industrious Jews!\" David said in the profile, which explores Bannon's early years in Hollywood, before he became a conservative media executive and Trump strategist.\n\nRob Reiner, one of the founders of Castle Rock, which produced \"Seinfeld,\" added of Bannon's profits, \"It makes me sick.\"\n\n*Also Read:* Steve Bannon Screams at Jared Kushner 'I Hate Your Stupid Face!' in Stephen Colbert Spoof (Video)\n\nAs TheWrap and others have previously reported, long before he became the chief strategist of Trump's White House and the executive chairman of Breitbart News, Bannon was an investment banker. He launched his own firm, Bannon & Co., in 1990. He was brought in to help Westinghouse Electric negotiate a minority stake acquisition in Castle Rock Entertainment -- the producer of the iconic Jerry Seinfeld comedy -- a person familiar with the deal told TheWrap.\n\nBannon and his team accepted a stake in the royalties of five Castle Rock shows, including \"Seinfeld.\" Bannon's involvement with Westinghouse was not disclosed to Castle Rock Parters at the time, who dealt directly with Turner in the 1992 sale.\n\n\"We calculated what it would get us if it made it to syndication,\" Bannon told Bloomberg in 2015. \"We were wrong by a factor of five.\"\n\n*Also Read:* 'Morning Joe' Warns Steve Bannon: 'When You Take on the Family, You Lose' (Video)\n\nHow much Bannon has earned from his stake in the show is unknown. The Financial Times reported in 2013 that \"Seinfeld\" had earned $3.1 billion in reruns. Even at 1 percent, that would mean Bannon & Co. would have made over $31 million since the show went off the air.\n\nBut in the New Yorker story, Connie Bruck noted that Bannon's profit participation in \"Seinfeld\" may have been capped out and paid out around 1995, when the show entered syndication and Turner Broadcasting merged with Time Warner. \"Since then, neither CBS nor Castle Rock nor Warner Bros. has records of payments to Bannon, if those records are as they were described to me,\" she wrote.\n\nIn addition, Bruck reported that no \"Seinfeld\" profit participations were included when Bannon submitted an \"income and expense delcaration\" in April 1997 in connection with his divorce from his first wife, whom the magazine did not name. \"Either they were not substantial or Bannon failed to disclose them in a sworn statement,\" she wrote, noting that he claimed an annual salary of about $500,000 and total assets of $1.1 million.\n\n*Related stories from

His tweet:\n\n\"The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is. They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry etc. Shame!\"\n\nOf course, by ripping the media on Charlottesville, the president is keeping alive a story that, by any measure, has been politically damaging for him. The same goes for his tweets calling it \"foolish\" to tear down \"our beautiful statues and monuments\" to Confederate leaders because \"you can't change history.\"\n\nWhether you agree or disagree with Trump's handling of the deadly episode, he's the one who elevated this into a political furor. His formulation of blame \"on many sides\" ignited the controversy Saturday; his explicit condemnation of white supremacists and neo-Nazis on Monday cooled the temperatures a bit; and his return to the both-sides-are-to-blame formulation Tuesday (and inclusion of \"nice\" people among the protesters) led to the current firestorm.\n\nAs I said on \"Special Report,\" the media shouldn't pretend there's some false equivalence between the KKK and Nazi types and the counter-protesters in Charlottesville, even if some in the latter group engaged in violence. But when you look at the coverage on some cable news networks, it's hour after hour of moral outrage with very few dissenting voices. Even on this hypersensitive subject, there is a need in journalism for some degree of balance.\n\nOn that point, a new CBS poll shows that 67 percent of Republicans approve of Trump's handling of Charlottesville, a finding completely at variance with the tone of the coverage. But with 82 percent of Democrats giving his response a thumbs down, the overall disapproval rate stands at 55 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a torrent of leaks as some of those who work for Trump try to distance themselves from what they view as a mess.\n\nThe New York Times has this killer graf: \"The president's top advisers described themselves as stunned, despondent and numb. Several said they were unable to see how Mr. Trump's presidency would recover, and others expressed doubts about his capacity to do the job.\"\n\nAnd then there is John Kelly, the retired general who was lauded for his presumed ability to bring order to an undisciplined White House. The Times says that the new chief of staff, \"who watched the president's performance on Tuesday with his head hung low, grimacing at some of Mr. Trump's remarks, is frustrated, according to people inside the White House.\"\n\nThe Times describes the dismay of Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, who stood near Trump on Tuesday, and in the Washington Post, \"those close to Cohn described him as 'disgusted' and 'frantically unhappy,' although he did not threaten to resign.\n\n\"But Trump felt vindicated after the remarks, said people familiar with his thinking. He believes that his base agrees with his assertion that both sides are guilty of violence and that the nation risks sliding into a cauldron of political correctness.\"\n\nAnd then there's Steve Bannon, who made a splash by sounding off in a call to Robert Kuttner, the liberal co-editor of the American Prospect (whose first issue after the election was \"Resisting Trump\"). The president's chief strategist made news on the showdown with North Korea, a trade war with China and his internal war against Cohn, but he said this about Charlottesville:\n\n\"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more. ... These guys are a collection of clowns.\" He said the White House \"can crush the Democrats\" if they talk about racism and the administration focuses on economic nationalism.\n\nSome associates said Bannon thought he was speaking off the record, a la Scaramucci, but Bannon told the Daily Mail that his comments \"drew fire away from POTUS\" and \"changed the narrative.\"\n\nBannon also told the Times: \"President Trump, by asking, 'Where does this all end?' -- Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln -- connects with the American people about their history, culture and traditions.\"\n\nIn this view, Trump is right where he wants to be, even if the media and political reaction has been overwhelmingly negative.", "id": "9867097", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Hitting back: Trump

Bannon reportedly spoke to Trump by phone throughout the weekend, but had not \"meaningfully advised\" the president on his response, according to the news website, Axios.\n\nFor his part, Bannon was reportedly encouraged by the backlash of the last few days, Axios reported Wednesday afternoon: \"Bannon saw Trump's now-infamous Tuesday afternoon press conference not as the lowest point in his presidency, but as a 'defining moment,' where Trump decided to fully abandon the 'globalists' and side with 'his people.'\"", "id": "9579270", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "'There are no good Nazis': Republican Jewish Coalition demands 'moral clarity' from Trump", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/5994c5d7b0e0b51c008b58fa-1190-625/there-are-no-good-nazis-republican-jewish-coalition-demands-moral-clarity-from-trump.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 224, "date": "2015-12-03", "amb": false, "textEnd": 236}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "180884", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "id": "302813", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}, "id": "302944", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}, "id": "303035", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bigotry"}, "id": "310173", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}, "id": "310713", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Republican Jewish Coalition"}, "id": "318682", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Jewish_Coalition"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hate group"}, "id": "373025", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_group"}, {"label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}, "id": "394340", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "396058", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vardar", "label": {"eng": "Vardar"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016"}, "id": "1268861", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign,_2016"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1181, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism"}], "time": "22:31:00"}

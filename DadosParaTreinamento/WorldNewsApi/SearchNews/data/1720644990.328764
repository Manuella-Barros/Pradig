The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) became aware of attacks involving the websites being flooded with internet traffic to prevent real users from accessing the services. These are known as Distributed Denial of Service attacks or DDoS for short. A spokesman for the department said on Saturday: \u201cThis activity is part of a pattern of events across the EU and is in line with the experiences of other EU Member States.\u201d The NCSC has been working with the websites involved offering technical advice and guidance, as well as co-ordinating the response. The spokesman said the impact has been minimal adding this was mainly due to how prepared the websites were for potential attacks. In the Netherlands, the outlet Politico.eu reported several websites belonging to Dutch political parties experienced similar attacks on Thursday. Those cyberattacks were claimed by a pro-Russian hacker group called HackNeT via their Telegam account, Politico reported. This Telegram account also indicates Bus \u00c9ireann\u2019s website was among those targeted, as was that of the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland and voter.ie, a website where Irish voters can check to see if they are registered to vote or not. It has also been reported that the European Court of Auditors' website was targeted. This site was down on Thursday afternoon but now appears to be functioning normally.", "summary": "The attacks were part of an organised campaign across EU member states", "url": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-41412218.html", "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8305/4152686_4_seoimage1x1_iStock-1279501051.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:45:00", "author": "Irishexaminer.com,Niamh Griffin", "authors": ["Irishexaminer.com", "Niamh Griffin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.168}

While it can sometimes be tough being away from her children \u2014 like she was while filming her Max travel show Thirst With Shay Mitchell \u2014 she thinks it\u2019ll help them learn to be more independent young women. \"I like to think that they would be proud knowing that I'm out there working and doing things that make me happy,\" she said. \"I would want that for them when they're older.\" Plus, it makes their reunion that much more special. \u201cI love to travel, but I also love to come home. That feeling of walking in your door and sleeping in your own bed \u2014 is there a better feeling?\u201d she added. \u201cA lot of times I am traveling solo for work, so the first thing I do is track down my girls.\u201d Here's everything to know about Shay Mitchell's kids: Atlas and Rome. Atlas Noa Babel, 4 The Onda founder revealed she was pregnant in June 2019, with an Instagram post and YouTube video. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of surreal processing the fact that another human is growing inside of you,\u201d she wrote in the caption. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting, nerve-racking, difficult and emotional all at the same time ... We\u2019re beyond excited and looking forward to starting a family.\u201d On Oct. 20, 2019, she and Babel welcomed their first child together, daughter Atlas, after 33 hours of labor. \u201cNever letting go,\u201d Mitchell captioned a photo of herself holding her baby\u2019s hand. The couple got the idea for the name from their friend but kept it a secret. \u201cA close friend of ours was listing off names ... she said Atlas and I looked at Matte, and he looked at me, and I was like, \u2018Oh my gosh,\u2019 \u201d she told Vogue. With a name like Atlas, it\u2019s no surprise she was born loving to travel. \u201cI aim to fill up her passport within the first year,\u201d Mitchell told PEOPLE in February 2020. \u201cShe\u2019s been to Vancouver, we\u2019ve been to Paris, Vegas ... and I\u2019m from Toronto so we\u2019ll be going there soon.\u201d She added that her daughter \u201cloves a plane almost more than I do.\u201d The You star immediately loved being a mom, sharing that she enjoyed seeing how Atlas changed every day. \"It's been great. There are just so many new little milestones that make every day a little bit more exciting,\" she said. \"It's been really wonderful to be able to spend this much time with her.\" As she grew, Atlas began having more in common with her mom, including taking selfies. Mitchell even posted a photo her daughter took of her and jokingly captioned it, \u201cSome people have ig husbands/wives and I have my four year old.\" In 2023, Atlas helped her mom launch a children\u2019s luggage line for her mom\u2019s company, B\u00c9IS. \"The inspiration was my kids and kind of looking around and having to buy her lunch boxes and backpacks for school, and seeing what I didn't see on the market,\" Mitchell told PEOPLE. \"We made [the line] really fun because I know from my own experience that Atlas loves colors and she wants things to be bright.\u201d Rome Babel, 2 The Dollface star and Babel announced they were expecting their second baby with an emotional Instagram post following the death of her grandmother. \"Saying goodbye to a loved one while simultaneously experiencing the joy of welcoming another into this world is the great cycle of life,\u201d she wrote alongside the maternity photos. \"This is proof that love, life, and loss can profoundly exist all at the same time. Gram, I miss you every day. Little one, we are so excited to meet you.\u201d Rome was born on May 22, 2023, with Mitchell confirming the news to PEOPLE two weeks later. \"I feel really, really good. It definitely takes a village. I'm really lucky my parents are in town and everybody's been really helpful,\" she shared. The actress added that the name she chose was \u201cvery special ... I think similar to Atlas, when I heard it, I knew it was just the perfect name.\" Shortly after, Mitchell explained that Rome's moniker was inspired by her late grandmother Romaine. \u201cWe\u2019re so happy you\u2019re here Rome, named after my best friend, my soulmate, my \u2018person,\u2019 \" she wrote on Instagram. Atlas instantly loved being a big sister. \"She is so excited. She's been incredible,\u201d Mitchell told PEOPLE. \u201cShe helps me change diapers and it's good \u2014 she loves it.\" As for having a second child join the family, the Velma voice actress revealed that it was an adjustment for her. \"People used to tell me going from zero to one was nothing compared to going from one to two, and that could not be truer,\" she said. \"Now I look back and I'm like, how did having one kid seem difficult for me?\" In honor of Rome's first birthday in 2022, Mitchell organized a photoshoot photos of their family surrounded her and Atlas. \"The perfect soul to fill your absence ? thanks for her Gram,\" she captioned the Instagram post.", "summary": "Shay Mitchell and her partner, Matte Babel, share two daughters", "url": "https://people.com/all-about-shay-mitchell-kids-8653653", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/KcSZ4_Q0_o7LjhSGV7H1vCPT5EA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(997x476:999x478)/shay-mitchell-kids-1-7a8d039815104cf48f58e392e0a8bb45.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:31:43", "author": "Emy Lacroix", "authors": ["Emy Lacroix"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.275}

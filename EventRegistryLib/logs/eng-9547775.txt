There is no police presence, as you can see. Mayor (Brandon) Scott is not doing anything to send police over here from what we understand, and until Mayor Scott really does something to send a police presence over here, the encampment is not going to be broken,\" said Caren Leven, the executive director of the Baltimore Zionist District.\n\nBrian Doherty, with the Baltimore mayor's office, released a statement, saying:\n\n\"We continue to be in daily contact with university officials. The city of Baltimore strongly stands with every person's First Amendment rights, and we are monitoring the situation to ensure everyone's safety. In the event of escalation, credible threat of violence, or similar change in the situation, we will adjust accordingly.\"\n\n\"The university is continuing to work to bring the encampment to a close given the serious risk of conflict and harm to the university community, as seen here already and at peer institutions around the country. Since the inception of the encampment, we've been in regular contact with students participating in the encampment and the Hopkins Justice Collective. We've extended multiple offers and engaged in negotiations to reach an end to the encampment.\n\n\"As part of this process, Student Affairs extended to students an opportunity to leave the encampment with reduced disciplinary consequences provided they commit not to return and not to engage in future disruptions that violate our guidelines for protest and free expression. We are pursuing other avenues for those who remain and would remind everyone that participation in the encampment is a trespass. We remain seriously concerned by the safety risks of the encampment.\"\n\nFor its part, the Hopkins Justice Collective released a statement, saying, in part:\n\n\"The administration did not approach the table with an offer that engaged our demands. The university offered a timeline that would merely 'consider' our (Public Interest Investment Advisory Committee) proposal for divestment in October of 2025. This is unacceptable. With every passing day, the violence of one of the most well-documented genocides in world history accelerates.\n\n\"Additionally, the university deflected blame from their complicity in the genocide of Palestinians by claiming that divestment would not produce a 'demonstrable effect,' and that it was a 'complex issue.' We reject their patronizing distractions and stalling tactics.\n\n\"Despite our clearly stated commitment to meeting the demands of the encampment in these talks, the university refused to budge. Instead, they escalated threats of disciplinary action against non-violent student participants and demanded we permanently disband.\n\n\"This meeting revealed that the university has not changed ... We will not be threatened into submission. We must continue to pressure the university towards urgent, actionable withdrawal from the occupation of Palestine. We will remain until our demands are met.\"", "source": {"uri": "wbal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBAL"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PDF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_conduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Code of conduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBAL_(AM)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WBAL (AM)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Johns Hopkins University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peerage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peerage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divestment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divestment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2100/2024/05/08171846/Untitled-11.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547775", "eventUri": "eng-9547775", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

This was paired with an additional threat that the encampment would be swept at 6PM today,\" the press release wrote.\n\nThe document of deferral conduct, sent to the rest of the Hopkins community at 4:34 p.m. today, asks that those participating leave the encampment by 6 p.m. and email confirmation of their departure to studentaffairs@jhu.edu. Further, students are required to go to Student Affairs in person on April 9 between 9 a.m.-1 p.m. to accept and sign the document.\n\nHJC stated that the administration failed to provide notice or reasoning for the threats in the letter.\n\n\"After yesterday's meeting with the administration, which produced a miserable offer to the encampment, this move from the University reads as despicable and fear-mongering,\" the statement reads.\n\nIn an email to The News-Letter, a spokesperson for the University wrote that the letter was sent to end the encampment, citing serious risks of conflict and harm to the Hopkins community.\n\n\"Since the inception of the encampment, we've been in regular contact with students participating in the encampment and the Hopkins Justice Collective.

The meeting took place on Tuesday, May 7 and discussed HJC's five demands: divestment, disclosure, boycott, demilitarization and denunciation.\n\nThe update stated that protesters expected the University to consider their demands in light of the Palestinian lives lost during the conflict and recent escalations in Rafah. HJC emphasized that Hopkins currently invests in weapons companies which aid Israel. The administration, however, responded differently, according to HJC, and did not take clear steps on the Public Interest Investment Advisory Committee (PIIAC) proposal HJC submitted regarding divestments.\n\n\"The Administration did not approach the table with an offer that engaged our demands,\" HJC wrote. \"The University offered a timeline that would merely 'consider' our PIIAC proposal for divestment (which can be found in our Linktree) in October of 2025. This is unacceptable.\"\n\nHJC stressed the current death count and violence in the region and criticized the administration's proposition of 18 months to consider their demands. They argued that the University's suggested time frame was designed to placate protestors and delay a response to their demands.\n\nHJC then claimed that the University deflected HJC's accusations that Hopkins is complicit in the conflict.\n\n\"The University deflected blame from their complicity in the genocide of Palestinians by\n\nclaiming that divestment would not produce a 'demonstrable effect,' and that it was a 'complex issue,'\" they wrote. \"We reject their patronizing distractions and stalling tactics. We have clearly described the violence that Hopkins supports through the APL and its financial investments.\"\n\nThe press release continued by arguing that the administration had sufficient time to consider and understand their demands, given that their formal request for divestment was submitted four days before and the encampment nine days before the meeting. Yet, the offer made by the administration did not engage the protesters' demands, the Collective argued.\n\nHJC then stressed that the University increased their threats of disciplinary action against the protesters during the meeting, urging them to permanently disband.\n\n\"After six hours of negotiations, in which Daniels repeatedly yelled at negotiators and threatened to leave the room, the encampment was given two hours (until midnight) to accept the offer or face immediate discipline in the morning,\" HJC wrote. \"In exchange for accepting, students would receive a mere pause in disciplinary proceedings contingent on our continued 'good behavior.' When the administration is bargaining for our silence, there cannot be a free and open discussion.\"\n\nHJC emphasized that disbanding the encampment will only be considered when Hopkins has made an effort to meet their demands of divestment, disclosure, boycott, demilitarization and denunciation.\n\nThe letter concluded by stating that the protesters will continue to urge the University to accept their demands.\n\n\"We will not be threatened into submission,\" they wrote. \"We must continue to pressure the University towards urgent, actionable withdrawal from the occupation of Palestine. We will remain until our demands are met.\"\n\n3:23 p.m. Open letter from HJC\n\nOn May 4, HJC released a letter to University affiliates about the Palestine Solidarity Encampment. They began the letter by remembering the 35,000 Palestinian people who have been killed in the war. They then voiced their appreciation for the support they have received thus far from the Faculty Senate and various student organizations on campus.\n\nHJC stated that the purpose of their letter is to clarify the goals and efforts of the protest. While they acknowledged that the encampment may disrupt current affairs at Hopkins -- namely senior graduation and finals week -- they contrasted life at the University with life in Gaza. The letter urged Hopkins students to consider this dichotomy, calling them to join the effort to pressure the University to concede their demands.\n\n\"Gazan children cannot go to school, university students no longer have their campuses,\" they wrote. \"Their semesters are truncated by mass death. They don't have the privilege to study for finals. We stand with them, and against Hopkins while it funds and engineers this incomprehensible loss of life.\"\n\nHJC continued by stressing the nonviolent nature of the protest, denouncing the administration's claim that it may attract violent individuals. They emphasized that the encampment agreement is based on nonviolent principles and forbids all forms of hate, specifically Islamophobia and antisemitism.\n\n\"We have been nothing but peaceful,\" they wrote. \"If there is any threat to the health and safety of the Hopkins community, it will come not from the encampment, but from the administration's choice to weaponize the police against its own student body and community.\"\n\nHJC drew attention to the distinction between anti-Zionism and antisemitism. They stressed that they are not advocates for religious hate, but rather denounce Zionist political ideology.\n\n\"Jewish solidarity has been central to Palestinian activism since before Israel's inception,\" HJC wrote. \"On Friday night, we kindled the lights of Shabbat with Rabbi Ariana Katz and held maghrib prayer side-by-side. We condemn Zionist political ideology and its right-wing ethnonationalist colonial project that founded Israel. Our anti-Zionism is incompatible with antisemitism.\"\n\nThe letter then condemned the notion that Baltimore community participation in the encampment serves as a threat to the safety of Hopkins students, arguing that the University's historical impact on the Baltimore community should not be overlooked.\n\n\"It is inaccurate and unjust to claim that residents of the city of Baltimore have no right to weigh in on Johns Hopkins's actions,\" they wrote. \"We aim to bridge the divide between the students of the University and the community of Baltimore, and we welcome the support of Baltimoreans.\"\n\nThey concluded by emphasizing that while University administration has not yet seriously considered HJC's demands, they have received considerable support from Hopkins affiliates, including students and faculty, and urged more to join their efforts.\n\n9:25 p.m. HJC and administration statements\n\nIn an email to The News-Letter, a University spokesperson shared documentation that the University extended invitations to meet with HJC on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and expressed concerns about waiting until Tuesday to meet.\n\nIn a press release, HJC responded to the University's framing of their organization and their willingness to enter negotiations.\n\n\"Since the beginning of the encampment, we have repeatedly asked that the University send us negotiation offers by email, which they have consistently refused to do,\" they wrote.\n\nHJC then described the reasons why they prefer to begin negotiations by email, including that negotiators can democratically discuss group actions and hold the University accountable to their written commitments.\n\n\"Beginning the negotiations via email is a way for our encampment to maintain a more\n\ndemocratic structure and have room to discuss the administration's response, together,\" they stated. \"Email allows the exchange and negotiation process to be in written record, holding the University accountable for their commitments or lack thereof. After one round of bad-faith negotiations on Monday, in which the University published widely that we had reached an agreement where there was none, keeping the record straight is something we feel acutely.\"\n\nHJC further underscored that the administration's requirement that the negotiation team be made of undergraduate students has made it difficult to meet on short notice.\n\n\"The Administration's insistence that the negotiation team comprise of only undergraduates means that while we have a team of students ready to ensure quick resolution, we also have finals, homework, volunteering, work, and other obligations to keep up with,\" they wrote. \"The encampment comes first, but it is an undue ask to respond to a request to meet at a scheduled time on Tuesday with 'actually, let's do it now!'\"\n\nHJC also stated that they had submitted a Public Interest Investment Advisory Committee (PIIAC) proposal on Friday morning, with no confirmation from University administration that the proposal had been read. They wrote that the encampment was not up for discussion, and that they would not negotiate unless the administration read their PIIAC proposal before meeting.\n\nIn emails to HJC from University administration, shared with The News-Letter by a University spokesperson, Vice Provost for Student Affairs Rachelle Hernandez and Vice President for Public Safety Branville Bard confirmed that the PIIAC request by HJC was received on Wednesday, May 1.\n\nFinally, HJC accused the administration of pressuring protestors into closed door negotiations, using the University's actions at Garland Hall as an example of these tactics.\n\n\"What JHU is doing by pressuring us into closed door negotiations day-of is an intimidation tactic,\" they wrote. \"This is an age-old strategy that they have used before, including at Garland Hall, when the University extended an offer to negotiate the morning after threatening a police raid, knowing negotiators would walk into the room sleep deprived, anxious, and not at their best. The University knows we are on an uneven playing field behind closed doors.\"\n\nHowever, HJC reiterated that they were willing to meet the University on their terms as long as they received advanced notice before negotiations. They wrote that the University had not yet accepted their offer to meet on Tuesday.\n\nIn an email to The News-Letter, HJC provided documentation of an email to administration, in which HJC reiterated the proposed meeting on Tuesday and offered the University the option of beginning negotiations over email to expedite the process.\n\n3:00 p.m. Email from Administration\n\nOn May 5, Vice Provost for Student Affairs Rachelle Hernandez and Vice President for Public Safety Branville Bard sent an email regarding the Safety and Student Conduct Code to all Hopkins undergraduates.\n\nIn their email, Hernandez and Bard stated the University's commitment to initiating disciplinary processes against students participating in the encampment, echoing President Daniels' message earlier this week. They specified that they were following existing procedures already outlined in the Student Conduct Code.\n\n\"While the university maintains its commitment to free speech and has stated our ongoing openness to meeting with our students participating in the demonstration, we have observed both behavior and statements from protesters that violate our policies and put the safety of our community at risk,\" they wrote.\n\nHernandez and Bard stated that they have heard from multiple individuals who are concerned about their safety on campus. In response, the University has already taken several measures including requiring Hopkins IDs to enter residence halls and making buildings on the Homewood campus only accessible by J-Card.\n\nStudents who have concerns or reports relating to safety on campus can call the SPEAK2US hotline at 844-773-2528 or can fill out the online form.\n\nHernandez and Bard emphasized that the University will maintain a discrimination-free environment, and that students should refrain from conduct that violates this policy. They also confirmed that they wish to maintain a normal living and learning experience, and stated that the administration has asked protesters to respect several provisions like quiet hours.\n\n\"We are working to maintain a living and learning experience as close to normal as possible as you prepare for final exams and end-of-year celebrations,\" they wrote. \"We have asked for demonstrators to respect quiet hours beginning at 8 p.m. We have also asked repeatedly for the protesters to remove the signs covering the Johns Hopkins University sign at the base of the Beach that are inhibiting parent and student opportunities for graduation photos.\"\n\nFinally, Hernandez and Bard wrote that they are working towards resolution with the protesters and are available to address any student questions and concerns.\n\n3:00 p.m. Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Faculty Senate Statement\n\nOn May 3, the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences (KSAS) Faculty Senate released a statement on the Palestine Solidarity Encampment. The goal of the letter was to provide University administration with guidelines on how best to address the issues that arise from the encampment as outlined in President Daniels' email on May 2.\n\nThe statement emphasized the goal of the University to encourage peaceful, civic participation in its student body. It explained how the Palestine Solidarity Encampment is an example of this.\n\n\"A number of faculty, including KSAS Senators, have visited the protest as observers; we have seen that the encampment has largely been civil and emphasizes the types of engagement that many faculty seek to develop in our students,\" the Senate wrote. \"Their protest has adhered to the sound principles of non-violence.\"\n\nThe letter then described the encampment as a \"space of learning,\" citing a lecture by a member of the Maryland House of Delegates hosted at the Beach as well as HJC's recent efforts to teach members de-escalation tactics.\n\nThe Senate went on to address the University's guidelines on counter-protest, which allow for the peaceful coexistence of protest and counter-protest on campus. They commended Daniels for upholding the right to free expression and acknowledging some of HJC's demands and encouraged him to continue in this spirit.\n\n\"Particularly given the non-violent nature of the protest, and the willingness of students to use this opportunity for education and training, we urge President Daniels to continue to follow principles of dialogue, engagement and de-escalation,\" they wrote.\n\nThe Senate then referenced the Faculty Fact Finding Committee report from the 2019 Garland Hall Sit-In, which suggested that, if the University had more strongly abided by these principles of free expression, the police action ultimately taken against the protesters may have been avoided.\n\n\"Democracy in America and abroad has grown by fits and starts, often attended by disruption,\" the Senate wrote. \"Many of today's Hopkins students (and faculty and staff) might not have become members of the Hopkins community without the institutional and social progress resulting from student protests at Hopkins and elsewhere.\"\n\nThe letter referenced the ACLU's letter to university presidents, which encouraged them to uphold their students' right to free expression and cited Wesleyan University and Oberlin College as examples that institutions can permit encampments.\n\n\"Any police action taken by Hopkins to disrupt a peaceful protest will heighten antagonism between Hopkins and surrounding communities, undermine some of the pro-democracy initiatives that Hopkins administrators have championed, and scar our community in unpredictable ways,\" they wrote. \"As emphasized in the ACLU letter, college administrators 'should involve police only as a last resort, after all other efforts [emphasis ours] have been exhausted.'\"\n\nThe letter then mentioned that protesters at the 2019 Garland Hall sit-in were ultimately unable to agree to engage in open dialogue with the University despite being offered the opportunity to do so. The Senate encouraged leaders of the encampment to participate in conversation with the University on behalf of its members.\n\nThe statement concluded by emphasizing the University's role in upholding the protesters' right to peaceful protest.\n\n\"As lifelong educators we know that time is a powerful tool,\" they wrote. \"And we emphatically believe that, as a community, we have abundant time to get this right without resorting to hasty action that curtails dialogue already in progress. We accordingly implore the Administration and protestors to continue the wise strategy of engagement and non-intervention.\"", "source": {"uri": "jhunewsletter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Information is accurate as of press time.\n\nProtests on college campuses calling for an end to Israel's military activity in Gaza and divestment from Israeli causes have become a considerable challenge for the Jewish community in the past few weeks. Many protesters have set up encampments and refuse to leave college campuses until their demands are met -- one of the longest-running is at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, where protesters have been camped out for over a month, while the encampment at Columbia University in New York drew the most media attention when it popped up a few weeks ago.\n\nMany Jewish organizations and government officials have released statements decrying these protests, criticizing them as a hotbed for antisemitic activity. Some university administrations have even called the police on protesters on their campus, leading to hundreds of arrests.\n\nAs of press time, Johns Hopkins University and Goucher College both have encampments on their campuses. Towson University does not have one, but students have previously organized protests. University of Maryland, Baltimore County also does not have an encampment or any active protests, but its chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine is currently facing charges from the college for violating its Code of Student Organization Conduct at a protest earlier this year. A group of UMBC social work school students have said they would protest graduation because of the Israel record of the school's keynote speaker, Sen. Ben Cardin, according to Jewish Insider.\n\nJohns Hopkins administration last month said students could protest but not overnight, and that students who violate rules could face disciplinary action. An encampment formed on the campus on Monday, April 29, with a group of students camping out there overnight, according to The Baltimore Banner.\n\nAccording to The Baltimore Sun, Hopkins administrators planned to meet with protesters Tuesday to negotiate a resolution to the encampment.\n\nThese encampments aim to draw attention to the over 30,000 people who have been killed in Gaza since Oct. 7, as well as promote campus legislation that would see the school divesting from Israel- and military-related causes. Johns Hopkins students specifically called out the university's partnership with Tel Aviv University, where students can participate in a two-year Master of Arts program; as well as its Applied Physics Laboratory's involvement with weapons manufacturers like Lockheed Martin.\n\n\"There is nothing antisemitic about the demand for Palestinian freedom and an end to U.S. support to Israel,\" said Matt Schwartz, a member of Jewish Voice for Peace Baltimore, in a statement supporting the Johns Hopkins encampment. \"We should carefully examine the proclivity of U.S. politicians, police and pundits to smear and silence these student activists standing in solidarity with Palestinians around the country, including many thousands [of] Jewish student activists. Such a proclivity speaks to the deep rooted anti-Palestinian racism, as well as antisemitism, baked into the political culture of the United States.\"\n\nIs it feasible that these protesters might get what they want?\n\n\"In more than a decade of anti-Israel student government campaigns, not one single university in the United States has ever altered their investment strategy, ended contracts with Israeli vendors, or canceled academic partnerships with universities in Israel,\" wrote Towson Hillel Executive Director Rabbi Alex Salzberg in an email to Towson's student body.\n\nGoucher College recently attempted to diffuse tensions on its campus by hosting a dialogue with activist Valarie Kaur, who spoke about the Israel-Hamas war and the current situation on college campuses. Like with Johns Hopkins' administration, Goucher President Kent Deveraux affirmed the students' right to protest in a campus-wide email titled \"When Campus Demonstrations Cross the Line,\" but decried protesting students who yelled at staff members, and called for the dissolution of the college's encampment.\n\n\"I have confidence that our students will remove the tents from the Academic Quad and find alternate ways to engage in productive conversations with me and others at Goucher while ensuring that our campus is a safe place for all,\" Deveraux wrote.\n\nHillel staff across the state have been in conversation with each other about these protests.\n\n\"Of course, our campuses are different from one another, and what works on one might not work on another,\" said Goucher Hillel Executive Director Josh Snyder in an interview with the JT. \"But we've also been supporting one another as professionals, in terms of our health and well-being. Hillel International has also done a lot to support us.\"\n\nSnyder stressed that he would like to avoid any confrontation between students and police like other campus encampments have faced, but that he's still worried about the spread of anti-Jewish sentiment, even through seemingly nonviolent protests.\n\n\"These protests may look peaceful, and like they're about students expressing their freedom of speech, but they are impeding on the academic freedom of other students,\" he\n\nsaid.\n\nTowson Hillel recently launched a petition for students who oppose divestment, which has accumulated over 3,000 signatures. Salzberg said that the state of American college campuses has become an issue of global concern.\n\n\"When I was in Israel last month, the concern that Israelis felt for our college students was real. Even in the midst of a war, they were worried about the climate on campus and the rise of antisemitism,\" he said. \"I am incredibly proud of our students. This is not what they expected when they came to Towson University. Their resilience and dedication to the Towson Jewish community and our family around the world is a point of light in otherwise dark times.\"", "source": {"uri": "jewishtimes.com", "dataType": "news",

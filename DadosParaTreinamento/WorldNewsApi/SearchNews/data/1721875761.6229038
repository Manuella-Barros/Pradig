The Pirates would like to see that power more often", "text": "PITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Oneil Cruz\u2019s tools can be breathtaking. The arm that lights up the radar gun on throws from deep in the hole. The long legs under his 6-foot-7 frame that seem to carry the Pirates shortstop around the bases in seemingly a handful of steps. Nothing, however, tantalizes like Cruz\u2019s power. His swing is a series of levers, levers that sometimes struggle to work in unison. When they do however \u2014 as they did in the first inning of a 4-3 win over Tampa \u2014 all the doubts about Cruz\u2019s ability to be a consistent difference-maker vanish are replaced with wonder. Tampa Bay\u2019s Zach Eflin tried to fool Cruz by throwing a first-pitch curveball and Cruz sent it soaring over the 21-foot-high Clemente Wall in right field. The ball sailed over the concourse and the slope behind it that runs down to the Allegheny River. When it finally splashed into the water 445 feet from home plate, the Pirates had tied the game and Cruz had offered a reminder that for as much work as there remains to be done, he remains one of the more gifted and unique players in the majors. The drive marked the sixth time a ball hit the river on the fly since PNC Park opened in 2001 and the 76th overall to make its way \u2014 by bounce, roll or otherwise \u2014 into the water. The crowd inside the roasting ballpark \u2014 the temperature at first pitch was 95 degrees \u2014 roared in delight. It says something about the pregame power displays that Cruz puts on regularly that his teammates mostly shrugged. While rookie pitcher Jared Jones called it \u201cprobably the farthest hit ball I\u2019ve ever seen in person,\u201d catcher Jason Delay practically yawned. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching him hit balls into the river in all the time,\u201d Delay said, thinking of batting practice. \u201cSo, it\u2019s fun to watch.\u201d Particularly when it counts. Asked if he thought it was going to end up sailing over the boats that moor themselves near the ballpark during the summer, Cruz took a long pause to think about it before shaking his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he said after his 10th homer of the season. \u201cBut I definitely knew it was a home run.\u201d It\u2019s hardly the first time Cruz has tested the outer limits of a stadium. When he was at Double-A Altoona, one of his moonshots crashed into \u201cThe Skyliner\u201d wooden coaster beyond the right-field wall. \u201cI knew right away it was going to hit the roller coaster,\u201d Cruz said with a boyish grin. The reality with Cruz is that the game at times can come easy to him. Everything he does can seem effortless. \u201cHe continues to do really special things,\u201d Pirates manager Derek Shelton. The key going forward is trying to have that specialness show up regularly. Cruz\u2019s home run ended a 1-for-13 skid. He\u2019s hitting .242 and his 31 RBIs rank a respectable second on the team, particularly considering the 25-year-old Cruz missed almost all of last season with a broken left ankle. The problem is, the Pirates aren\u2019t scoring nearly enough to supplement a pitching staff that has budding 22-year-old aces Jones and Paul Skenes as well as veteran Mitch Keller, who is making a run at a second straight All-Star appearance. Pittsburgh\u2019s offensive numbers languish in the bottom half of the National League, the main reason the Pirates have been plodding along a just under .500 as midseason nears. General manager Ben Cherington spent 20-plus minutes on Saturday admitting his team needs to score more runs while remaining vague about just how aggressive the Pirates might be on the trade market. Cherington believes the easiest path forward is for the players on the roster to produce more regularly. Those six giddy seconds in which Cruz\u2019s ball started in one structure and landed not too far from the confluence of the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio Rivers were great. Yet what the Pirates don\u2019t need are the occasional tape-measure shots. They need the ball to go over the fence more often. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s by one foot, or 100. \u201cOnce it goes over the fence, I don\u2019t care where it lands,\u201d Shelton said. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter. As long as it goes very the yellow barrier, it can land in the first row or land in the Allegheny, it doesn\u2019t matter to me. It counts the same.\u201d ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2phcmVkLWpvbmVzLXBpcmF0ZXMtYjA1NjMxZDVmZTZiZjdkMmI4MGIzNDczMjZlNTVhN2bSAQA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Oneil Cruz finds the Allegheny River on the fly.

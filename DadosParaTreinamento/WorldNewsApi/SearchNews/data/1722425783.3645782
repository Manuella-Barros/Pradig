{"id": 243212926, "title": "Dems have no realistic Biden replacement theory", "text": "In 1960, the New York Yankees fired their legendary manager Casey Stengel for being too old. \u201cI\u2019ll never make the mistake of being 70 again,\u201d Stengel quipped. If Democrats dump Joe Biden, the president might want to say the same thing about being 81. The biggest loser of the debate, besides the president himself, was first lady Jill Biden. One assumes that the she was the one with the most influence on her husband\u2019s foolhardy decision to run for a second term, and could have persuaded him to stand down last year and give Democrats time to have a normal nomination process. Instead, she went along with the hubristic delusion that an already unsteady 80-something could serve in the most demanding job on the planet until . . . January 2029. Now, the bodyguard of lies of Democrats and much of the left-of-center media that had protected Joe Biden from questions about his fitness for office has finally fallen away. Still, there\u2019s no mechanism to force him out of the race unless he and Jill make the decision themselves. If Biden does exit, suddenly Donald Trump isn\u2019t running against an octogenarian considered too old for a second term by a super-majority of Americans prior to his debate debacle. The natural heir is the vice president. Kamala Harris has many weaknesses, but, at a youthful 59 years old, frailty is not one of them. As a historic nominee and a progressive Democrat, she would be the beneficiary of deliriously favorable coverage in glossy magazines and much of the elite media, at least initially. On the other side of the ledger, she\u2019s as unpopular as Biden and would be saddled with the administration\u2019s record. She\u2019s a terrible boss and is utterly charmless. Biden has held up pretty well in the Rust Belt states, while Harris would probably give up ground there. An upside of Biden\u2019s age is that he seems too old to be a radical; Harris, though, is a progressive from central casting, combining the politics of Elizabeth Warren with the charisma of Al Gore. Even with the age issue neutralized, Trump would be favored over her, so it\u2019s not clear how much Democrats would gain by making a painful switcheroo. If Biden goes, it will be an admission that he was a failure and that Democrats have been lying about his condition for years \u2014 not an auspicious basis for launching a new candidate, who, by the way, won\u2019t have won any votes in a primary or caucus. Getting to a stronger potential candidate requires bypassing Harris, which involves its own complications. Is an identity-politics-obsessed party really going to pass over the first African-American female vice president of the United States? Even if it can, an alternative presumably wouldn\u2019t be the unanimous choice of a Democratic convention, creating chaos at an event typically choreographed to drive the message of a presumptive nominee. If Democrats can somehow work through all of this, someone like Gretchen Whitmer would be a much tougher opponent for Trump on paper. She\u2019s a young, relatively popular governor in the key swing state of Michigan. She wouldn\u2019t have to answer directly for any of Biden\u2019s failures and has a history of presenting herself in campaigns as a non-ideological Democrat: \u201cFix the damn roads\u201d was her slogan when she first ran for governor. Any somewhat conventional Democrat would have a better odds against Trump than Biden. It\u2019d be easier for such a candidate to make the race all about Trump, something Biden wanted to do, but is going to be impossible after his catastrophic debate. The likelihood, though, is that Democrats won\u2019t find a way to push aside Biden. At the end of the day, by going along with the deceptions about his mental and physical state and hoping that the public somehow wouldn\u2019t notice, Democrats chose to hire Joe Biden at age 81. They presumably won\u2019t make that mistake again, but it may well be too late for 2024.

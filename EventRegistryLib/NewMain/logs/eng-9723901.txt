She added she's \"really hoping\" Poilievre doesn't rely on his signature taglines, like \"axe the tax\" and \"stop the crime.\"\n\n\"We're going to need real action and we're going to need to know how [a Poilievre] government is going to work,\" Laewetz said.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pierre Poilievre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_of_First_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assembly of First Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Indian residential school system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Individualism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Commons of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Nations in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_8_Tribal_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treaty 8 Tribal Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gordon_First_Nation", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Gordon First Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idle_No_More", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Idle No More"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibus_bill", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Omnibus bill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsartlip_First_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tsartlip First Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canadian_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Canadian Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saskatchewan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saskatchewan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.7225604.1717620487!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/commons-20240603.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723901", "eventUri": "eng-9723901", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

In 2022, he delivered a video address. In it, he said he feels a sense of optimism about the ability to work together on issues, including on clean drinking water and housing. He also spoke about chiefs having the freedom to exercise rights that are affirmed in treaties and in the Constitution.\n\nAFN National Chief Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak, who was elected to her role in December, 2023, has said that under her leadership, she will not accept videos from politicians who wish to make remarks. She invited Mr. Poilievre and other politicians to speak at this week's assembly.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh will also make a speech on Thursday. On Wednesday, Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Gary Anandasangaree spoke to leaders. Justice Minister Arif Virani and Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc also made remarks this week.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has been at the NATO summit in Washington this week. In the past, he has addressed chiefs gathered for AFN meetings.\n\nIt remains to be seen how First Nations leaders in the room for Mr. Poilievre's speech will react to his attendance. Many First Nations leaders were highly critical of the approach by Mr. Harper, including his resistance to call a national inquiry to examine the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\nA draft copy of Mr. Poilievre's speech was provided to The Globe and Mail by a Conservative source. The Globe is not identifying the source because the individual is not authorized to speak publicly about internal matters.\n\nAccording to his draft remarks, Mr. Poilievre will discuss how for decades, the residential school system removed children from their families, amounting to a \"monstrous abuse of excessive government power\" that cut children off from cultures, languages and traditions.\n\n\"In many cases, students were neglected and abused,\" his notes state. \"Tragically, too many young children never made it home. Those were terrible crimes by a big imposing government against each victim and against your communities.\"\n\nAccording to his speaking notes, Mr. Poilievre will point to the 2008 apology delivered by Mr. Harper on residential schools and call it a \"step toward healing and making amends.\"\n\nMr. Poilievre had to deliver an apology of his own in the House of Commons shortly after Mr. Harper's when he told an Ottawa radio station he wasn't sure Canada was \"getting value for all of this money\" being spent on compensation for residential school survivors.\n\nIn 2023, Mr. Poilievre also received criticism, including from Liberal cabinet ministers, for delivering remarks to the Winnipeg-based Frontier Centre for Public Policy that in 2018 ran radio ads with claims about debunking myths about residential schools. When he was asked about that appearance in an interview with City News, Mr. Poilievre said he speaks to hundreds of groups every year and he does not agree with everything these groups stand for.\n\nIn his address to the AFN assembly on Thursday, Mr. Poilievre is also expected to tell First Nations leaders he has \"made no secret\" about his desire to see more growth and development in Canada.\n\n\"If reconciliation means anything, it means saying 'yes' to the economic opportunities that First Nations are asking for,\" the draft speech said. \"When your future is at stake, your right to say 'yes' is as important as your right to say 'no.'\"\n\nMr. Poilievre will also point to his support for a First Nations proposal called the First Nations Resource Charge, designed to allow communities to take greater control over resource revenues.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr. Poilievre announced his support for it, saying it would result in simplified negotiations between resources companies and First Nations while respecting treaty and constitutional rights, including the duty to consult. The plan was developed by the First Nations Tax Commission.\n\nMr. Poilievre will also reference a court battle launched by First Nations in Ontario, which are seeking a judicial review of Ottawa's carbon-pricing regime.\n\n\"I support the judicial review launched by the Chiefs of Ontario to remove the burden of the federal carbon tax from First Nations,\" Mr. Poilievre's draft speech states. \"When I'm Prime Minister, you will be able to drop the lawsuit and save some money on lawyers because when I say I am going to axe the tax, I mean it.\"\n\nAt Ms. Woodhouse Nepinak's first press conference after becoming national chief, she was asked whether she supported the step taken by the Ontario chiefs and she responded \"absolutely.\"", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com",

He pointed to the high costs of housing, food prices, and the rising number of Canadians accessing food banks.\n\n\"When they go to the grocery store, they cry at the checkout because they can't afford the price tag.\"\n\nThe situation is even worse outside of Alberta, Poilievre said, pointing to the 256 homeless encampments in Toronto, including 50 new ones in the last three months.\n\n\"The good news is that life was not like this before Justin Trudeau, and it won't be like this after he's gone.\"\n\nPoilievre told supporters that a Conservative government would stop overspending and money printing, axe the carbon tax, and champion Canadian energy.\n\n\"Instead of creating more cash, we're going to create more of what cash buys, grow more food, build more homes, and produce more Canadian resources,\" he said. \"Here in this country, we know how to do it. We need to unleash the unmatched might of the free enterprise system.\"\n\nHe also committed to increasing inspections of shipping containers which are being used to transport stolen Canadian vehicles. Additionally, Poilievre promised to implement a Tax Reform Commission with a three-point mandate to find tax cuts for Canadian-made products, cutting administrative and compliance burdens, and lowering taxes for the working class.\n\nThe Tory leader's speech highlighted Trudeau's absence, which comes as some speculate whether he will resign after the Liberals lost a Toronto stronghold in a byelection last month. This marks the first time Trudeau missed the Stampede since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\"Don't feel offended, Calgary, that Justin Trudeau is hiding from you,\" Poilievre joked. \"He's actually hiding from his own caucus, terrified to meet with the people who are supposed to be his greatest supporters.\"\n\nThe crowd laughed when Poilievre talked about cutting funding for the CBC and converting the state broadcaster's headquarters into housing. Supporters likewise applauded and jeered when he referred to Jyoti Gondek as an \"incompetent NDP Liberal mayor.\"\n\nAccording to recent data, Gondek is the least popular politician in Canada, falling even further in the polls than Trudeau. The numbers follow a breach in a major water feed main in Calgary which took weeks to be fixed while Calgarians were placed under water restrictions and encouraged to report those who didn't comply.\n\nPoilievre closed his speech by painting an image of Canada much like a decade ago when food and homes were affordable, the economy was flourishing, and firearms owners didn't fear confiscation of their legally acquired property.", "source": {"uri": "tnc.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "tnc.news"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_parker@tnc.news", "name": "Rachel Parker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pierre Poilievre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary_Stampede", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Calgary Stampede"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Calgary"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Calgary"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reform Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_cut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax cut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyoti_Gondek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jyoti Gondek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Working class"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Industrial_Hemp", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Industrial Hemp", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.tnc.news/media/2024/07/PP-Facebook.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723901", "eventUri": "eng-9723901", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Now, they can't even get a large portion of the population to think about the Conservative Leader - because their feelings about Justin Trudeau get in the way.\n\nThe Liberals want to tell people that Mr. Poilievre is too right-wing, or bent on launching an era of austerity, or uninterested in climate change. They want to make people question whether a prime minister Poilievre is really what they want.\n\nBut there are whole swaths of the electorate that can't hear that over the pounding din of their irritation with Mr. Trudeau. They aren't open to comparison shopping. They're just frustrated with how things are.\n\nIt's pretty clear who isn't listening. When Mr. Trudeau called the last general election in August, 2021, his Liberals were roughly level among male voters with then-Conservative leader Erin O'Toole's party in Nanos Research polls. Now, they are 30 percentage points behind among men.\n\nYoung male voters, in particular, are upsetting incumbents in a lot of places.\n\nIn Britain, voters in all demographics turned on the Conservatives in the July 4 election, but young men notably boosted support for the right-wing populist Reform UK party. In France, Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally has surged with the votes of young men. In the U.S., young voters gave President Joe Biden victory in 2020, but young men are leaving him now.\n\nThe Liberals could content themselves with the notion that there are angry voters all around the world right now, squeezed by inflation and still feeling postpandemic angst - and that, maybe, as Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault said recently, there will come a time when the anger will subside and Liberals can have a different conversation.\n\nBut Canada's young men aren't coming to back listen to Mr. Trudeau. The PM has been the focal point of Canadian politics for nearly a decade, and the personification of frustration with the status quo.\n\nThere has been a lot of theorizing about the political alienation of young men in the U.S., where several authors have noted that young men are less likely to earn a university degree than women, and surveys now find that many feel like the deck is stacked against them.\n\nCertainly, the discontent with Western government since inflation and interest rates started rising sharply in 2022 has often been driven by male voters in their 20s and 30s. In Canada, the Liberals are running neck and neck with the Conservatives among women, but are far behind among men.\n\nThe sharp decline in real incomes of those who don't own assets and the feeling that buying a home might be permanently out of reach has apparently created more frustration among men. Conservatives might credit Mr. Poilievre with pinning all those things on Mr. Trudeau, but many voters were more than willing to blame the Prime Minister.\n\nAnyone who can read a poll knows that Mr. Trudeau isn't very popular at the moment. The Liberals June 24 by-election loss in the stronghold of Toronto-St. Paul's shocked many inside the party into doubting that the Mr. Trudeau's popularity can ever bounce back.\n\nWith Mr. Trudeau, they can't even get young male voters to listen to the argument they want to use: that their challenger, Mr. Poilievre, is too risky or wrongheaded to be allowed the reins of power. Many Canadians won't spend time thinking about Mr. Poilievre as long as Mr. Trudeau is in the frame.\n\nAfter the loss in Toronto-St. Paul's, the Liberal strategy has been to soften the anger and promise to do more to make life better.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters last week that the message from voters is that life is hard right now, and the government has to do more to help. Liberal cabinet ministers keep citing programs such as child care and dental care as examples of what the government can do to help.\n\nThat might be first step to cooling anger and alienation of voters. Their real goal is to get voters to start thinking, negatively, about Mr. Poilievre - but Mr. Trudeau is in the way.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe

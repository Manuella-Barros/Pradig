He believes and he has always been saying that within the tenets of democracy, you have every right to do whatever you want to do provided that right does not infringe on another person's right.\n\nIdris emphasised that President Tinubu is not opposed to protests, but rather to violence and any actions that could negatively impact the wellbeing of Nigerians.\n\nHe stressed the importance of balancing individual rights with the need to maintain public order and safety.\n\nIdris conveyed that President Tinubu is fully aware of the genuine concerns and complaints expressed by Nigerians across the nation and he is actively working to implement effective policies aimed at alleviating the challenges faced by the citizenry and bringing relief to all Nigerians.\n\nThe Minister said in an unprecedented move, President Tinubu is fashioning out a policy of paying stipends to all young university and polytechnic unemployed graduates in the country pending their formal employment in any sector of the economy.\n\n\"But beyond that, there is also another new policy that the President has formulated, which will begin to be seen very soon and that is that all young men and women who have finished universities and polytechnics and have certificates and have done their mandatory NYSC and have not been able to get jobs, will have something from the government to keep them afloat until the time they get jobs,\" he said.\n\nHe explained that because of the President's commitment to the welfare of Nigerian workers, even after the Tripartite Committee on the National Minimum Wage concluded its assignment and submitted its report, the President sustained his engagement with the Organised Labour Unions until an amicable resolution was reached, which gave birth to the N70,000 national minimum wage.\n\nIdris said the introduction of the Compressed National Gas (CNG) policy by the President is a game changer in the country's economy because of its ability to bring down the cost of transportation by about 60% thereby providing a viable alternative for petrol and diesel.\n\nThe Minister said henceforth, any government procurement of vehicles or machinery, must have a component of CNG embedded in the contracts.\n\nHe also highlighted the significant improvement in the security situation in the country, saying since the advent of the Tinubu administration, there has been a remarkable improvement in most of the flashpoints in the country, especially the Abuja-Kaduna Expressway, which used to be a nightmare for motorists.\n\nIn his remarks, the President General of the Charismatic Bishops Conference, Archbishop Leonard Kawas, dissociated the conference from the planned national protest, saying they had been approached by some groups to join the protest.\n\n\"Your Excellency, recently we received some calls from some other religious organizations and other organizations asking us to join in preparation for a nationwide protest, which would start from 1st August 2024.\n\n\"We are here to let you know that we do not think the same. That we have rather decided to go all out and call for a truce.\n\n\"We have decided to sue for peace and humbly request that our brothers and sisters who are aggrieved in one way or the other, that they should give us some time while we continue to communicate and negotiate with this government on areas that are pertinent to them,\" he said.\n\nHe said after the 2024 Synod, they have resolved to partner with the Federal Government in prayers and advocacy for the success of the Tinubu Administration.\n\nArchbishop Kawas acknowledged that the Administration has made tremendous progress in social investment, the introduction of the Student Loan Scheme, security, infrastructure in the FCT and across the country, and the introduction of the N70,000 National Minimum Wage among others.\n\nThe Charismatic Bishop Conference also used the occasion to present a Meritorious Service Award to the Minister.", "source": {"uri": "tribuneonlineng.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

So some unscrupulous people may use the opportunity to create chaos.\n\n\"So we are discouraging any protest but we appeal to government to dialogue and also look at critical areas that are necessary and address them amicably,\" he said..\n\nHe called on the government to adopt the carrot and stick method in addressing the problem of insecurity in the country.\n\n\"We acknowledge and observe the insecurity situation in the country and we call on the government to use carrot and stick by ensuring that the result be seen. Let all the security chiefs do what is right to ensure that Nigerians are protected,\" he said.\n\nThe Caucus also called on the government to create means to ensure citizens are self reliant in a bid to tackle the economic downturn in the country.\n\n\"We also acknowledge in our discussion that there is hunger in the land and we appeal to the government not only to be giving palliatives but to create ways and means whereby people can be self-reliant,\" he said.\n\nHe said the dinner was organised to thank all the members for their support.\n\n\"Basically the main purpose of our gathering yesterday was just end of year dinner. We feel it is important to organise a dinner and thank all our members for giving us the necessary support, all the minority parties in the House,\" he said.\n\nShelve action, embrace dialogue, Abiodun urges youths\n\nSimilarly, Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun has appealed to Nigerian youths to constructively engage the government in finding lasting solutions to Nigeria's problems rather than engaging in protests that could cause more harm to the country.\n\nAbiodun made the appeal when he met with the coalition of youth organizations in the state at the Governor's Office, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta.\n\nThe governor, who recalled the destruction of lives and properties occasioned by the EndSARS protests across the country in 2020, said protests could only aggravate issues without necessarily finding solutions to them.\n\nHe said: \"And yet again, there are calls for mass protests across the country, and the first thing that agitates one's mind is, is that the way to present our case to government? Is that the way to constructively and objectively engage with government by advertising and planning mass protests? Is there something behind those who are calling for these protests? Is this another plan by those who have tried their luck and have lost? Is this their own way and shortcut to see how to frustrate the government?\n\n\"Young men and women, you have no other country than this country. Let me assure you that I have travelled far and wide. I am sure, like many of you, there is no country in the world where you can walk like your own, that country is Nigeria. There is no other place where nobody will accost you, and you would not challenge that person.\n\n\"You can not go to London and say do you know who I am and the people there will not look at you and say that you have an identity problem. But in Nigeria, you can look at somebody in the face and say \"do you know who I am?\"\n\n\"There is a Yoruba proverb that says 'beheading is not the solution for an headache'. If there are issues, let us discuss them, let us find a way around them, let us manage and correct them. Let us not cut off the head or attempt to cut off the head because of a headache. That will amount to decapitation,\" Abiodun advised.\n\nHe said Nigeria, like many countries across the world, was going through difficult times, hence the need for the youths to bring in their vibrancy, zeal, ingenuity, and technical know-how in solving the problems.\n\nThe governor acknowledged the maturity displayed by the youths in the State during the EndSARS protests.\n\nHe added: \"This engagement will not be complete if I do not thank you, the Ogun State youths. I will be ungrateful, and it will be the peak of ingratitude if I do not appreciate your matured conduct during that period.\n\n\"I want to remind you that there was EndSARS, when there were protests in different parts of the country, particularly in Lagos, Abuja, and other parts where there were looting, burning and the likes.\n\n\"They were attacking anything attackable, but you, the youths of Ogun State said though we are angry and dissatisfied with the ways things are, we are not criminals, we are not looters, we will not participate in the protest, to that I say a big thank you.\"\n\nWhile taking time to explain some of the policy thrust and the direction of his administration in the last five years, Governor Abiodun said emphasis were placed on Infrastructure, Social Welfare and Wellbeing, Education, Youth Empowerment and Job Creation and Agriculture as encapsulated in the ISEYA mantra.\n\nHe said his administration has done well in health, education, infrastructure, and security, which, without them, no meaningful socio-economic development could take place.\n\nAbiodun who also spoke on the recent attacks on his person and administration said: \"I normally don't get disturbed by such things because one of my mentors in politics told me that in politics, you must make sure that you are mentioned either for the right or wrong reasons, but be continuously mentioned because if you are not mentioned, you are just part of the crowd.\n\n\"For me, I am not bothered that I have been under attacks by faceless people on social media because I know what I am. I know who I am. I know what I did before I became governor. I know how long I have been in this journey. I became a senator before I was 35, the youngest at the time and I have been on this space in the State contesting on different platforms from that time until God decided that He was going to make me a governor and someone would imagine that after all that I had gone through to get to this position, all I will do is to be bitting my fingernails. That person must be a joke.\n\n\"I became the governor under the most torturous and most difficult circumstances. I can't go through that baptism of fire to get to the office and become complacent.\n\n\"Our Internally Generated Revenue was around N50 billion a year before. But in four years, we have grown it to almost N200 billion, and someone says Dapo Abiodun is just sitting in Ogun State and doing nothing. That has to be a joke,\" the governor stated.\n\nWhile maintaining that his administration has young brilliant men and women who are contributing their quota to the development of the State, Prince Abiodun said the meeting was to rub minds on the current realities in the country as it affects the youths in the State, calling on them to remain focused and not pay attention to distractions that could jeopardize their future.\n\nSpeaking further, Abiodun said that he had to sign an executive order to split the Ministry of Youths and Sports into the Ministries of Sports Development and Youths Development to create an avenue for the proper development of the youth constituency and Sports in the state.\n\nHe assured the youths that the Ministry of Youths Development would soon get its own commissioner, who he said would be young, brilliant, and vibrant.\n\n\"I believe that it took us a bit of time to formalize the creation of that ministry. When you create a ministry, you must have a permanent secretary and other paraphernalia of office for it to be a ministry.\n\n\"Not having a Commissioner for Youths Development is not deliberate or intentional. I want to promise you that you will get that commissioner and that commissioner will be one who will be able to relate with you and also articulate the needs of your generation to the cabinet,\" he added.\n\nSpeaking earlier, one of the youths, Motolani Oyediji, called for more youth inclusion in government, while the State Chairman, National Youth Council, Kolawole Soremi, called for the appointment of a Commissioner for Youth Development to handle youth related issues in the State and also regular interface between the youth and government to address issues that may cause misunderstanding.\n\nFor things to get better, it has to be tough for a while, Oba of Benin tells Nigerians\n\nMeanwhile, the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewaure II, has appealed to the Nigerian youths to shelve the planned protest slated for August 1, 2024.\n\nIn a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Osaigbovo Iguobaro, the first-class monarch noted it takes a while for things to get better.\n\nHe appealed to aggrieved Nigerians to give the Federal Government enough time to implement its economic policies which are expected to alleviate the present hardship.\n\n\"For things to get better, it has to be tough for a while.\"\n\nThe Monarch also appealed to the federal government to intensify efforts in the implementation of of its economic and security policies.\n\nOba Ewuare therefore advised those that are planning the nationwide protest to shelve the plan.\n\nRecall that some youths had proposed August 1, 2024 to begin a 10-day nationwide hunger and hardship protests across the country to draw the federal and State governments' attention to the plight of citizens.\n\nPresident Bola Tinubu had appealed to Nigerians to give him more time to accomplish his plans for the nation.", "source": {"uri": "championnews.com.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Champion Newspapers Limited"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_Tinubu",

Instead, they recommended an engagement with the federal government.\n\nBut the leadership of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which supported the protest, said it was a constitutional right of the people.\n\nIn a similar vein, Minority Caucus of the House of Representatives urged the federal government to dialogue with planned protesters with a view to addressing their concerns.\n\nMinister of Information and National Orientation, Mohammad Idris, issued the warning against the protest yesterday, when he received members of the Charismatic Bishops Conference, led by Archbishop (Professor) Leonard Kawas, who were on a courtesy visit to him, at his office in Abuja.\n\nIdris said government was cautious and bothered about the protest against economic hardship, having seen the debilitating consequences of similar protests in other parts of the world, particularly in Kenya and Bangladesh.\n\nThe minister voiced concern that arsonists and criminals might be waiting to hijack the planned protest and unleash violence on innocent Nigerians.\n\nIdris stated, \"Why everybody is very cautious and very weary of this national protest is because we have seen what has happened around the world.\n\n\"We know that it's almost impossible to hold this protest and then have peace at the end of the day. We cannot do that because some people are waiting to take the laws into their own hands.\"\n\nHe said while the government of President Bola Tinubu acknowledged the right of every Nigerian to engage in protests, it was equally committed to ensuring that the activities did not disrupt public order or violate the rights of others.\n\nAccording to him, \"You see, the government of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu believes in the freedom of everyone within the confirms of the law to do what he thinks is right for him.\n\n\"Therefore, the president is not an opponent of protest of any kind. But the president is an opponent of violence and anything that will hamper the wellbeing of Nigerians.\n\n\"He believes and he has always been saying that within the tenets of democracy, you have every right to do whatever you want to do provided that right does not infringe on another person's right.\"\n\nIdris asserted that Tinubu was fully aware of the feelings of Nigerians across the country and he was actively working to implement effective policies aimed at alleviating the challenges faced by the citizenry and bringing relief to all Nigerians.\n\nThe minister said one of the policies being fine-tuned by government was to begin to pay stipends to all young university and polytechnics graduates after the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme, pending their formal employment.\n\nHe stated, \"But beyond that, there is also another new policy that the president has formulated, which will begin to be seen very soon, and that is that all young men and women who have finished universities and polytechnics and have certificates and have done their mandatory NYSC, and have not been able to get jobs, will have something from the government to keep them afloat until the time they get jobs.\"\n\nHe described the introduction of the Compressed National Gas (CNG) policy by the president as a game changer in the country's economy because of its ability to bring down the cost of transportation by about 60 per cent, thereby providing a viable alternative to petrol and diesel.\n\nIdris said, henceforth, any government procurement of vehicles or machinery must have a component of CNG embedded in the contracts.\n\nEarlier, President General of the Charismatic Bishops Conference, dissociated the conference from the planned national protest, saying they have been inundated with calls by some groups to join the protest.\n\nKawas said, \"Recently we received some calls from some other religious organisations and other organisations asking us to join in preparation for a nationwide protest, which would start from 1st August 2024.\n\n\"We are here to let you know that we do not think the same. That we have rather decided to go all out and call for a truce. We have decided to sue for peace and humbly request that our brothers and sisters, who are aggrieved in one way or the other, that they should give us some time while we continue to communicate and negotiate with this government on areas that are pertinent to them.\"\n\nHe appealed to aggrieved Nigerians in all parts of the country to give peace a chance and toe the path of dialogue and negotiation because no reasonable government will fold its hands and allow violence to break down the country.\n\nAfter the meeting with the SGF yesterday, Idris also spoke to journalists.\n\nMinisters at the meeting were Tahir Mamman (Education); Abubakar Bagudu (Budget and Planning); Wale Edun (Finance); Bello Matawalle (Defence); Nyesom Wike (Federal Capital Territory); Yusuf Tuggar (Foreign Affairs); and Zephaniah Jisalo (Special Duties); David Umahi (Works).\n\nNational Security Adviser (NSA) Nuhu Ribadu also attended the meeting.\n\nThe information minister said the federal government was not sleeping and would handle the protest over economic hardship like a family affair to ensure the stability of the country.\n\nHe begged for more time from Nigerians to get to the root of the matter.\n\nIdris said, \"We came together to discuss. You can see that this is not happening at the Council Chambers, it's happening at the office of the SGF and many of the ministers are here.\n\n\"We have discussed issues of national interest and all of us are working for Nigeria and we hope and believe that Nigeria is going to be great again.\n\n\"The planned protest is a family matter. All issues will be resolved in a way to ensure the peace and stability of the country. No one is going to sleep.\n\n\"Those who are agitating and asking for protests are Nigerians, they are our brothers, they are our sisters, they are all Nigerians and those in positions of authority; the ministers, the president, everybody, we are all Nigerians, too.\n\n\"So, this is a family matter. This is a Nigerian family issue and all of us are looking at this issue very well and we hope that peace will prevail at the end of the day.\"\n\nIdris also shared insights on human rights advocate and lawyer, Femi Falana, SAN, who insisted that the planned protest was a constitutional right, saying Falana is entitled to his opinion in a democracy.\n\nIdris said, \"He (Falana) is an individual. This is a democracy; everyone is entitled to his opinion. The protesters are also Nigerians; this is a democratic situation. What I keep saying is that we are all Nigerians and we are all acting in the interest of Nigeria, but suffice it to say that yesterday, Mr President said there is no need for any protest, let us calm down.\n\n\"A lot is happening, Nigeria is going to move and march on and we believe that whatever government comes out with will be in the interest of Nigeria.\n\n\"We don't think that there is need for any protest, we are appealing for calm; we are appealing for a peaceful resolution or peaceful approach to any issue.\n\n\"If you have anything that you want to put out there, you are free to put it out there, but government is insisting that we are all Nigerians, we have to be calm, we have to be patient and suffice it to say that let us give peace a chance.\n\n\"Mr President is working round the clock, his ministers are working, everyone is working, all hands are on deck.\"\n\nNLC: Protest Didn't Originate from Us\n\nA statement by NLC President Joe Ajaero said the congress had not called for the protest and as such could not withdraw from it.\n\nAjaero was responding to suggestions that NLC had withdrawn from the planned protest, describing the story as patently false.\n\nAjaero said the fact that NLC was not part of the organisers did not mean that it was oblivious of the dire living conditions Nigerians had been subjected to by the harsh policies of the Tinubu government.\n\nThe statement said, \"The truth is that the Nigeria Labour Congress cannot withdraw from a protest that it did not organise. It is only the organisers of the speculated national protest that can decide to pull out or continue with the protest.\n\n\"The Nigeria Labour Congress has internal trade union mechanisms, especially leadership decision-making processes, that its industrial actions, such as protests, pass through before such activities are undertaken.\n\n\"Yet, the fact that the Nigeria Labour Congress is not the body organising the protest does not mean that organised labour is oblivious of the dire living conditions Nigerians have been subjected to by the harsh economic policies of government.\n\n\"The Nigeria Labour Congress stands in solidarity with the Nigerian people in this very trying and excruciating times.\"\n\nAjaero added that NLC still maintained its position that the government should adopt proactive engagement with the issues canvassed by the protest organisers. He said Tinubu should to invite the leaders of the protest movement to dialogue on their demands.\n\nThe NLC president stated, \"We have advised that it would be counter-productive for government to meet the widespread anger in the land with brute force.\n\n\"Once again, we implore the federal government and the sub-national governments to listen to the cries of the Nigerian people and do the needful. After all, it is said that the voice of the people is the voice of God.\"\n\nUzodimma: South-east Governors against Protest\n\nSouth-east Governors' Forum distanced itself from the planned nationwide protests on August 1, citing concerns about the fragile political environment and possible hijack by criminal elements.\n\nChairman of the forum, Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State, made the position of the zonal governors known while speaking with newsmen at State House, Abuja, after meeting President Bola Tinubu.\n\nUzodimma was in company with the governor of Ebonyi State, Francis Nwifuru, and former President of the Senate, Pius Anyim, who recently defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe governor acknowledged that protests were allowed in a democratic setting, but pointed out the need for reasonable conception and clear objectives. He questioned the motives behind the protests, saying the organisers have not publicly disclosed their reasons.\n\nThe chairman of the Progressives Governors' Forum warned that protests could worsen the economic hardship caused by the global recession and advised against overheating the polity.\n\nHe urged potential protesters to engage with the government to address specific issues, rather than resorting to demonstrations, saying the five governors of the South-east geo-political zone are opposed to a protest at this time.\n\nUzodimma said, \"Democracy is about opinion of the people and the protest is allowed in a democratic setting. Every protest must be reasonably conceived to be able to make political sense. I think it's too early at this time in the life of this government for anybody to come out to say he wants to protest.\n\n\"First of all, there has not been any engagement where those who are sponsoring the protest were able to tell us the reasons for the protests. Secondly, given the global situation today and the insecurity in the country, we have a very fragile political environment that if not managed and protected very well, may collapse the entire country.\n\n\"So those who are going to protest, what is the reason for the protests, and if they have no reason for the protests, I think our advice, well-meaning Nigerians, citizens of this country who are making sacrifices, some of us have paid the supreme price for the existence of this country, we should guard our country very jealously.\n\n\"I think it is wrong time for anybody to do any protests because the implication of doing that, if care is not taken, is that it may be hijacked, like the #EndSARS experience, where criminals now hijacked an innocently conceived agitation by young Nigerians.\n\n\"So this is another kind of temptation that I think those behind the protests, because they have not been able to come out openly to say they're behind it, there is a motive that is yet to be unravelled.\"\n\nAbiodun Urges Youth to Embrace Dialogue\n\nOgun State Governor Dapo Abiodun appealed to youths in the state and the country at large to shelve the planned protest and embrace peace and dialogue.\n\nAbiodun, who spoke during an engagement with a coalition of youth organisations in the state, appealed to them to be calm and not to cut the head to cure a headache.\n\nHe called on the coalition to always engage with him by putting their issues across, urging them to be civil, objective, and constructive.\n\nThe governor said, \"I want to plead with you that yet again there are calls for mass protest across the country, and the first thing that agitates one's mind is, is that the way to present your case to government?\n\n\"Is that a way of constructive and objective engagement with government by advertising and planning a protest? Is there something else behind those calling for the protest? Is this another plan by those who have tried their luck and have lost?\n\n\"Young men and women, we have no other country than this country. Let me assure you, there is no other country in the world where you can walk freely like your own country. There is no other place; we have no other country but this.\n\n\"If there are issues, let us discuss them. Let us find a way around them, let us manage them, and let us correct them. Don't let us cut off the head to cure a headache.\"\n\nShelve Protest, Arewa Group Cautions\n\nA non-governmental organisation (NGO), Rebuild Arewa Initiative for Development (RAID), kicked against the proposed nationwide protests.\n\nIn a press release issued by the group's Director of Strategic Communications and Publicity, Comrade Bitako Umar, RAID said the nationwide protests might not be the solution to the difficult situation facing the country.\n\nWhile acknowledging the socio-economic hardship many Nigerians were experiencing at the moment, including economic challenges, insecurity and social unrest, the group cautioned that the genuine desire for progress might be hijacked by those with other ulterior motives.\n\nIt stated, \"Even though we know that grievances through protests is a democratic right, but it is not the most reliable or effective means to resolve issues.\n\n\"We also believe that protests alone will not provide the solutions we seek or crave for. So, we call on Nigerians, particularly our youths, to channel their strength and wisdom towards dialogue and constructive engagement.\"\n\nEngage FG, Northern Groups Plead\n\nNigerian Forum for the Sustenance of Democracy (NFSD), yesterday, appealed to organisers of the proposed protest to engage in constructive dialogue with the federal government instead of taking to the streets.\n\nNFSD President, Hon. Abdulrahman Kwaccham, made the appeal at a press conference in Abuja, where he emphasised the importance of maintaining order.\n\nKwaccham said, \"We must recognise that any disruption of law and order will worsen our already challenging economic situation, further intensifying the suffering endured by our people.\n\n\"We must engage in constructive dialogue and seek lasting solutions to the socio-economic issues that plague our nation.\"\n\nIPCR Sues for Calm, Restraint\n\nInstitute for Peace and Conflict Resolution (IPCR) issued a call for calm and restraint ahead of the planned protests against the administration of President Bola Tinubu.\n\nThe Institute called on civil society groups, organisers, and other bodies involved in the planned protests to be cautious of their action in order to avoid inflaming the already precarious situation in the country.\n\nIt insisted that they should note that although the country was facing hard times, the situation was not unique to Nigeria, as the world at large was grappling with a global economic crisis.\n\nIPCR also urged citizens to avoid fanning the flames of disunity and disrupting the fragile peace currently enjoyed amid insecurity.\n\nDirector General, IPCR, Dr. Joseph Ochogwu, in a statement, said, \"This wise counsel comes at a critical juncture, as protests at this point in time could jeopardise the renewed hope agenda of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\"\n\nAyirimi: Tinubu Not Cause of Hunger\n\nA chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Delta State and Itsekiri leader, Chief Ayirimi Emami, yesterday, said the rising food inflation and hunger in the country were not the making of President Bola Tinubu.\n\nEmami, while addressing newsmen shortly after performing prayers for the Itsekiri nation during the \"Ologbotsere Day\" celebration at his Ubeji residence, maintained that Tinubu should not be held responsible for the hunger in the country. He said the president inherited a wobbling economy.\n\nEmami stated that what was happening in the country, with regard to food inflation, predated the Tinubu-led APC administration and stressed that the APC governments were the offspring of successive bad governance.\n\nHe stated, \"A lot of people are saying there is hardship in the land and I agree. Rarely there is hardship but this hardship is not caused by Asiwaju. These were wrong foundations that were laid and I pitied the president that he inherited a very wrong foundation and he is struggling with it to ensure that Nigeria moves forward.\"\n\nBwala Warns against Violent Protest\n\nA member of All Progressives Congress (APC), Daniel Bwala, expressed concerns about the planned nationwide protests, warning about it turning violent.\n\nBwala said the protest against the present government at the centre had political undertones and possibly foreign interests.\n\nAddressing newsmen at State House, Abuja, after a meeting with President Bola Tinubu, Bwala contended that the proposed protests were not solely driven by genuine concerns over economic hardship.\n\nHe affirmed that though protests were constitutional, there was need for peaceful demonstrations, citing social media posts and intelligence reports that suggest a violent tone to the protests, which can lead to a breakdown of law and order.\n\nBwala made reference to Section 45 of the Nigerian constitution, which allows for laws to be made to abridge rights in the interest of public safety, protection of life, and national security.\n\nHe added, \"Every opposition member will want to support any action of the people that will ridicule, denigrate or show the governing party as not effective. So it is not surprising that he could say that.\"\n\nPDP Backs Protest, Says It's Matter of Right\n\nPeoples Democratic Party (PDP) voiced its support for the proposed protest, saying it is a matter of constitutional right. This came barely 24 hours after the PDP presidential candidate in the last general election, Atiku Abubakar, expressed support for the planned action.\n\nIn an interview during a television programme, \"Nigeria the Right Way\", on AIT, the acting national chairman of PDP, Umar Damagum, expressed the party's support for the national protest.\n\nDamagum said, after all, the protest was constitutional, as it was the same people who were opposed to the protest that conducted the same action against President Goodluck Jonathan in 2012.\n\nHe stated, \"This is the same people that led protests on President Goodluck Jonathan and his administration. The history is there.\n\n\"They were at the forefront because they felt at that particular time that things were not working well. And if today and people are feeling that things are not okay, and they want to express their grievances and you want to link it to the opposition, so, be it.\n\n\"We are Nigerians and we are feeling the same way like them today. We are worse than what we used to be. So, why can't people protest. It is their rights.\"\n\nAPC NWC: FG'll Address Challenges\n\nNational Working Committee (NWC) of All Progressives Congress (APC) called on the youth to shelve the planned protests, and assured them that the federal government would address the economic challenges facing the country.\n\nThe NWC also called for an emergency meeting of chairmen of APC in all the 36 states of the federation for further discussions. National Secretary of the party, Senator Ajibola Bashir, disclosed this while addressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja after the 153rd NWC meeting of the party\n\nBashir stated, \"The APC at its 153rd NWC meeting has joined the president to passionately appeal to those who are planning protests to shelve their plans and have confidence and belief in the government to address most of the economic challenges facing the nation.\n\n\"The NWC also noted that since coming on board in 2023, the government met quite a number of challenges, especially economic challenges, and Mr President is gradually implementing programmes and policies that would in the nearest future, bring succour and relief to the citizens.\"\n\nBashir stressed that the most of the economic challenges were global issues, adding that they can only be addressed after thorough brain-storming.\n\nHe said NWC also noted that some of the issues highlighted by the protestants were political, while others were constitutional matters that could only be addressed through the amendment of the constitution, which was on-going at the National Assembly.\n\nDialogue with Protesters, House Minority Caucus Urges FG\n\nMinority Caucus of the House of Representatives urged the federal government to dialogue with the planned protesters with a view to addressing their concerns.\n\nLeader of the Caucus, Hon. Kingsely Chinda, made the call while speaking with journalists at an end of session dinner.\n\nChinda also called on the government to adopt the carrot and stick method in addressing the problem of insecurity in the country.\n\nHe stated, \"We also appealed to the government to dialogue with the planned protesters and also look at some of the messages they are raising, the critical areas that need government intervention. Government should intervene and ensure that issues are resolved amicably.\n\n\"We are not going to encourage any protesters because in the past we have observed in most cases that even peaceful protests have been overtaken by hoodlums and with the insecurity situation in some parts of the country, you may not have control of the gathering of people. So some unscrupulous people may use the opportunity to create chaos.\n\n\"So we are discouraging any protest, but we appeal to government to dialogue and also look at critical areas that are necessary and address them amicably.\"\n\nThree Northern Groups Back Out of Protest\n\nThree northern groups, the Arewa Youth Assembly (AYA), Arewa Think Tank (ATT), and Sir Ahmadu Bello Memorial Foundation (ABMF) withdrew from the planned nationwide protest against hunger and socio-economic hardship.\n\nA communique issued after their meeting in Kaduna said protests under any guise were counterproductive and could lead to violence and loss of lives.\n\nThe communique, which was read by Muhammad Yakubu, Convener of ATT, said the three groups had resolved that they would not participate in the planned nationwide strike scheduled for August 1.\n\nThe communique read, \"We strongly denounce protests under any guise, as they are counterproductive and can lead to violence, loss of lives, and destruction of properties.\n\n\"Therefore, we have resolved that we will not be part of any protests. We call on Nigerian youth to engage authorities constructively through peaceful and legal means, such as dialogue and constructive engagement.\n\n\"We, the youth of the Arewa Youth Assembly, remain steadfast in our commitment to fostering entrepreneurship, advocating for youth development, and promoting peace and progress in our nation.\n\n\"We call on all stakeholders, including the government, civil society, and the private sector, to join hands with us in achieving these goals.\"", "source": {"uri": "thisdaylive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "THISDAYLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

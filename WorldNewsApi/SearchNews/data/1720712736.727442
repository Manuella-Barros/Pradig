Approx. 360,000 people were in areas with light shaking (intensity IV), the highest intensity this quake likely produced over inhabited areas.

The main factors that contribute to this evaluation are: The maximum expected ground shaking from this quake was unlikely to reach dangerous levels over populated areas; it should not have surpassed intensity V (Moderate) on the MMI scale significantly. The quake appears to have occurred far from densely populated areas (far as in relation to its magnitude). The quake occurred relatively deep under the surface (125 km or 78 mi depth). This significantly weakened the shaking on the ground of this quake if compared to a magnitude 5.7 event at shallower depth. CommentOverall, the population in this region resides in structures that are a mix of vulnerable and earthquake resistant construction. The predominant vulnerable building types are informal (metal, timber, GI etc.) and unreinforced brick masonry construction.A magnitude 6.2 earthquake 245 km west of this event struck this region on December 21, 1983 (UTC), with estimated population exposures of 5,000 at intensity VI and 5,000 at intensity VII, resulting in a reported 10 fatalities.Recent earthquakes in this area have caused secondary hazards such as landslides that might have contributed to losses.Source: USGS Green alert for shaking-related fatalities and economic losses. There is a low likelihood of casualties and damage. Expected fatalities The risk of fatalities from this quake is considered low and classified as Level GREEN, the lowest on a color scale from Green (low) to Red (very high). USGS estimates that there is a 65.3% chance that there are no direct fatalities as effect of shaking and a 30.2% chance that between 1 and 10 fatalities occurred. The likelihood that there are more than 100 fatalities is less than 1%. Expected economic damage The economic impact of this earthquake is expected to be minimal or small (Level GREEN). Only light damage if any should have occurred. USGS calculates an 65.3% chance of total economic loss in the range of 0-1 million US Dollars and a 30.2% risk of losses between 1 and 10 million US Dollars. Total economic loss from this quake is not likely to surpass 10 million US Dollars (less than 1% chance).

In the capital of Papua New Guinea, Portus Moresbiensis, 888 km (552 mi) away from the epicenter, the earthquake was probably felt as very weak shaking.The following table shows some of the places that might have been affected (or not) by the shaking.

What is Intensity and the Mercalli Intensity Scale?The amount of shaking that occurs on the surface due to an earthquake is called the intensity. It is commonly measured on the so-called Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale (MMI) ranging from 1 (not felt) to 10 (extreme shaking), and given in Roman numerals as I,II,...IX, X, and often displayed with color codes ranging from light blue to dark red.Earthquake intensity depends mainly on the magnitude and depth of the quake as well as the distance from the epicenter: The further away, the less shaking intensity occurs.Read more about the MMI scale!Number of reports by intensity Shaking intensityNumber of reportsMin-Max distance from epicenter (*)Average distance (*)II: Very weak shaking1887\u2013887 km (551\u2013551 mi)887 km (551 mi) Notes(*) Reports are filtered to exclude those that are likely highly inaccurate or esaggerated.Only reports with latitude/longitude coordinate positions given (2 in total) could be used for geographic statistics.

When aftershocks are detected, we will update this section.What are aftershocks?Larger earthquakes (above magnitude 5 or so) such as this one are usually followed by smaller ones known as aftershocks that occur in the same area during the days, weeks, months or even years after the main shock.[More info]Aftershocks are typically at least one order of magnitude smaller than the main shock. Their size and frequency decreases with time.What about this quake?Based on its magnitude, the fault that was active during the quake likely ruptured beneath a surface of approx. 50 km2 (=19 sqare miles) as a first-order estimate. The length of the rupture zone thus was probably around 12 km (8 mi).[More info]Aftershocks for this quake can be expected to occur during the days and few weeks following the quake at or near the same fault, at distances of up to approx. two times the length of the rupture zone, or in this case 25 km (15 mi). The often broadly linear arrangement of aftershock epicenters encompasses the rupture zone of the main shock (see map below).Recorded aftershocks, latest first (0 quake)Date and Time GMTMagDepthDistanceRegionDetailsJun 10, 2024 03:28 am (GMT +11)5 hours ago - felt5.7125 km0 km - This quake181 km WNW of Panguna, Papua New GuineaMain Shock (this quake)MoreMap of aftershocks Earthquake statisticsAverage number of earthquakesBased on data from the past 14 years and our earthquake archive back to 1900, there are about 34 quakes on average per year in the area near the epicenter of this quake (within 100 km/61 mi):Mag. 8 or higher: 0.02 quakes per year (or 1 quake every 62.5 years)Mag. 7 or higher: 0.1 quakes per year (or 1 quake every 9.6 years)Mag. 6 or higher: 0.63 quakes per year (or 1 quake every 1.6 years)Mag. 5 or higher: 8.9 quakes per yearMag. 4 or higher: 38.6 quakes per year (or 3.2 quakes per month)Mag. 3 or higher: 40 quakes per year (or 3.4 quakes per month)Mag. 2 or higher: 40 quakes per year (or 3.4 quakes per month)The area where this quake occurred has a very high level of seismic activity. It has had at least 2 quakes above magnitude 8 since 1900, which suggests that larger earthquakes of this size occur infrequently, probably on average approximately every 60 to 65 years.Number of quakes per year Previous quakes in the same area of this earthquake Strongest in 3 yearsThe earthquake was the strongest to hit this part of Papua New Guinea in over 3 years.

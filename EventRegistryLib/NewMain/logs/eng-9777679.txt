How are you going to resolve this dispute? Present the minutes. If the minutes reveal discrepancies between the opposition and the government, the opposition can file an appeal and wait for the courts to handle it.

People who disagree should have the right to express their views and challenge the results, while the government has the right to defend its position,\" Lula added.\n\nVenezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE) has yet to release the official minutes to validate the election results, which reportedly gave Maduro a victory with 51.21 percent of the votes compared to 44 percent for Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, according to CNE.\n\nPart of the opposition, along with some countries and organs like the Organization of American States (OAS), are questioning the fairness of the election and demanding the release of the minutes for a proper audit of the votes. In response, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government accuses certain opposition figures and foreign nations of inciting an alleged coup d'\u00e9tat against the electoral results.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon (30), Lula and US President Joe Biden discussed the situation in Venezuela on the phone following the presidential elections on Sunday (29). Both leaders emphasized the importance of publishing the electoral records.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said President Biden thanked Lula for his regional leadership regarding the Venezuela situation.

The 21-year-old won with a time of 19.46 seconds, making him the fifth-fastest of all time, but Lyles was down on his personal best by almost half a second.\n\nAfter crossing the line, Lyles congratulated Tebogo and embraced the new champion before falling onto his back. His breathing was heavy and Lyles struggled to get up. When he did, he was attended to by medics and when he left the track he did so in a wheelchair.\n\nWithin minutes of the end of the race, NBC reported that Lyles had tested positive for Covid before the race. A few moments later, a statement from the USA track and field federation confirmed that Lyles had tested positive on Tuesday.\n\nWhy was Lyles allowed to compete?\n\nAt the Tokyo Olympics, a positive test for Covid would have resulted in an athlete being placed in isolation and there is no way Lyles would have been able to race under the same guidelines.\n\nBut three years later, the world is a different place and at the Olympics, much like in other sports and at work and schools, there are no such policies at Paris 2024 and Covid is treated like other respiratory illnesses.\n\nIn their statement, the US track and field federation said they and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee had fully adhered to the guidelines set out at the Olympics.\n\n\"We swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritise his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nAccording to Lyles, he tested positive early on Tuesday morning after waking up in the middle of the night with \"chills, aching and sore throat\". He was placed into a quarantine in a hotel near the Olympic village but the only people who knew were \"the medical staff, my coach, my mum\".\n\nHe said he kept the positive Covid test \"close to the chest\" because he did not want the competition to get an \"edge\" over him ahead of the 200m final.\n\nWhat else did Lyles say?\n\n\"It definitely affected my performance. I've had to take a lot of breaks... I was coughing through the night.\n\n\"I'm more proud of myself than anything, coming out here to get a bronze with Covid.\n\n\"I've had better days, but I'm walking around again. I was quite light-headed after that race.\n\n\"Shortness of breath, chest pain, but after a while I could catch my breath and get my wits about me. I'm a lot better now.\"\n\nLyles also competed in the semi-finals of the 200m on Wednesday, a day after returning a positive test. He was beaten by Tebogo in the semi-finals in his first defeat in the 200m in 26 races.\n\nDid he put his fellow athletes at risk of catching Covid too?\n\nLyles was seen embracing gold medal Letsile Tebogo after the race - but the new 200m champion said he did not mind Lyles competing in the final with Covid as athletics is \"not a contact sport\".\n\nTebogo said he saw Lyles warming up for the 200m final in a face mask and had suspected that something was up with the American after beating him in the semi-finals. He said he did not know Lyles had Covid.\n\nLyles said he \"stayed away from everybody\" when he returned to the track but the images immediately post-race suggested otherwise.\n\nWill Lyles race again at the Olympics?\n\nLyles had aspirations of winning four gold medals at the Olympics and the next leg of his plan would have been in the 4x100m relay on Friday night. The 4x400m relay is then scheduled on Saturday night.\n\nLyles, however, said in an Instagram post that the 200m \"will be the end of my 2024 Olympics\" - the American said that it was up to the coaches of the 4x100m to make a decision on whether he competes after describing himself at around \"90 to 95 percent\" for the 200m.\n\n\"First I want to thank God for getting me through this entire Olympics! Second I want to congratulate [Letstile Tebogo and Kenny Bednarek] and everyone else on an amazing Olympic 200m final. Finally I want to thank everyone for the supportive messages.\n\n\"I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics. It is not the Olympic I dreamed of but it has left me with so much Joy in my heart. I hope everyone enjoyed the show. Whether you were rooting for me or against me, you have to admit you watched, didn't you?

Instead of Lyles reeling in the runner two lanes to his right, Letsile Tebogo of Botswana, Tebogo pulled farther way. The American favorite, who had gone three years without losing in the 200, labored into the finish and collapsed onto the track after ending up in third.\n\nThe insidious specter of COVID, the killer virus that upended the globe four years ago and made the last Olympics part of its collateral damage, struck at the Paris Games, too.\n\nIn a bracing reminder that the virus is still very much a factor, even if its deadly fingerprint has been blunted, the world's marquee sprinter, racing on the world's biggest sports stage, revealed he had tested positive two days before his shocking, but now not-inexplicable, bronze-medal finish in the 200.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" Lyles said, wearing a mask, as he spoke to reporters, whose mere congregation in a jam-packed scrum underneath the stadium was unthinkable three years ago at the delayed Tokyo Games. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nWith the blessing of officials at USA Track and Field and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, who said they followed protocol, Lyles did run.\n\nHe finished in 19.70. That was .39 off his personal-best, and .24 behind the 21-year-old Tebogo. Lyles' U.S. teammate Kenny Bednarek finished second, marking the second straight Olympics in which he and Lyles finished 2-3.\n\n\"When I saw Kenny fade, I knew Noah was far, far, far away behind us,\" Tebogo said. \"So that means I'm the Olympic champion.\"\n\nIt was Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone vs her own world record\n\nAn hour after that shock, Americans Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone lowered her world record for the sixth time, finishing the 400-meter hurdles in 50.37 seconds for another Olympic blowout.\n\nThat was one of three gold medals and eight overall the U.S. won on a night filled with big events.\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall jumped 7.10 meters to capture the long jump and get in the Olympic win column next to some greats, including Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Brittney Reese.\n\nGrant Holloway cruised to gold in the 110 hurdles, claiming the Olympic title that eluded him three years ago in his only major-championship loss.\n\nLyles seemed like a sure thing, until things got weird the night before\n\nComing into Paris, Lyles, the three-time world champion with the American record and the world's best time of 2024 on his resume, had seemed like as sure a thing in the 200 as any single athlete at track this side of McLaughlin-Levrone.\n\nAfter opening with a scintillating win in the 100 four nights earlier, he was trying to become the first man to complete the 100-200 double since Usain Bolt did it eight years ago.\n\nA troubling sign, however, came the night before when Lyles finished second in his semifinal heat, also to Tebogo. It marked the first time he had lost a 200-meter race of any sort since his disappointing third-place finish in Tokyo.\n\nHe also hurried out of the stadium after that loss and went to the medical tent -- a rare occasion when he didn't stop to talk to reporters. His coach said he was fine.\n\nLyles said he tested positive two days after the 100 final\n\nTurns out he wasn't. Lyles said he tested positive early Tuesday morning and quickly got into quarantine.\n\nHe drank fluids, rested as much as possible and tried to gear up for the race. USATF said in a statement that Lyles was given \"a thorough medical evaluation\" and chose to compete.\n\n\"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely,\" the statement said.\n\nThe scene after the race was jarring. Usually one of the most energetic guys on the track, both before and after any sprint, Lyles collapsed, rolled onto his side and gasped for breath. He turned over on his hands and knees, then went to one knee, and balanced himself with his fist.\n\nHe finally stood up and wobbled toward the medics, signaling for a cup of water. Then, he left in a wheelchair.\n\n\"It definitely was an effect,\" Lyles said. \"But I mean, to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything for coming out and getting the bronze medal with COVID.\"\n\nThis bronze medal feels different than the last one\n\nIt will take time for all the repercussions of this race to play out.\n\nThere's still a chance Lyles could end up as the bigger-than-track superstar he set out to become after his disappointment in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThose Games, staged in front of no fans while the COVID pandemic raged, took a mental-health toll on Lyles, one he said made him less than himself and led to his disappointing finish in Tokyo.\n\nAfter he won the 100 Sunday night, he took that Tokyo bronze medal out during his news conference, dropped it on the table and explained it was the thing that motivated him to become a new person and a new sprinter for this Olympic cycle.\n\nThe 100-meter thriller sealed the first half of the deal. But instead of breezing through the 200, just getting to the starting line became a product of \"trying to get me on as much medication as we legally could to make sure that my body was able to just keep the momentum going.\"\n\nLyles posts that he likely won't run in the 4\u00d7100 relay\n\nAs Thursday turned to Friday in Paris, Lyles took to social media and posted his thanks to fans for their supportive messages and his congratulations to Tebogo and Bednarek.\n\nHe also said \"I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics,\" where he was supposed to run the anchor leg in the final of the men's 4\u00d7100 on Friday.\n\n\"It is not the Olympic I dreamed of but it has left me with so much Joy in my heart,\" he wrote. \"I hope everyone enjoyed the show. Whether you were rooting for me or against me, you have to admit you watched, didn't you?\"\n\nThe spectacle Lyles headlined struck a sobering chord at a revitalized Olympics that were supposed to be all about the return of fans and the return of the Games as we used to know them.\n\nLyles reminded us that there will never be a \"post-COVID\" Games.", "source": {"uri": "india.com", "dataType":

Instead of Lyles reeling in the runner two lanes to his right, Letsile Tebogo of Botswana, Tebogo pulled farther way. The American favorite, who had gone three years without losing in the 200, labored into the finish and collapsed onto the track after ending up in third.\n\nThe insidious specter of COVID, the killer virus that upended the globe four years ago and made the last Olympics part of its collateral damage, struck at the Paris Games, too.\n\nIn a bracing reminder that the virus is still very much a factor, even if its deadly fingerprint has been blunted, the world's marquee sprinter, racing on the world's biggest sports stage, revealed he had tested positive two days before his shocking, but now not-inexplicable, bronze-medal finish in the 200.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" Lyles said, wearing a mask, as he spoke to reporters, whose mere congregation in a jam-packed scrum underneath the stadium was unthinkable three years ago at the delayed Tokyo Games. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nWith the blessing of officials at USA Track and Field and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, who said they followed protocol, Lyles did run.\n\nHe finished in 19.70. That was .39 off his personal-best, and .24 behind the 21-year-old Tebogo. Lyles' U.S. teammate Kenny Bednarek finished second, marking the second straight Olympics in which he and Lyles finished 2-3.\n\n\"When I saw Kenny fade, I knew Noah was far, far, far away behind us,\" Tebogo said. \"So that means I'm the Olympic champion.\"\n\nIt was Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone vs her own world record\n\nAn hour after that shock, Americans Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone lowered her world record for the sixth time, finishing the 400-meter hurdles in 50.37 seconds for another Olympic blowout.\n\nThat was one of three gold medals and eight overall the U.S. won on a night filled with big events.\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall jumped 7.10 meters to capture the long jump and get in the Olympic win column next to some greats, including Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Brittney Reese.\n\nGrant Holloway cruised to gold in the 110 hurdles, claiming the Olympic title that eluded him three years ago in his only major-championship loss.\n\nLyles seemed like a sure thing, until things got weird the night before\n\nComing into Paris, Lyles, the three-time world champion with the American record and the world's best time of 2024 on his resume, had seemed like as sure a thing in the 200 as any single athlete at track this side of McLaughlin-Levrone.\n\nAfter opening with a scintillating win in the 100 four nights earlier, he was trying to become the first man to complete the 100-200 double since Usain Bolt did it eight years ago.\n\nA troubling sign, however, came the night before when Lyles finished second in his semifinal heat, also to Tebogo. It marked the first time he had lost a 200-meter race of any sort since his disappointing third-place finish in Tokyo.\n\nHe also hurried out of the stadium after that loss and went to the medical tent -- a rare occasion when he didn't stop to talk to reporters. His coach said he was fine.\n\nLyles said he tested positive two days after the 100 final\n\nTurns out he wasn't. Lyles said he tested positive early Tuesday morning and quickly got into quarantine.\n\nHe drank fluids, rested as much as possible and tried to gear up for the race. USATF said in a statement that Lyles was given \"a thorough medical evaluation\" and chose to compete.\n\n\"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely,\" the statement said.\n\nThe scene after the race was jarring. Usually one of the most energetic guys on the track, both before and after any sprint, Lyles collapsed, rolled onto his side and gasped for breath. He turned over on his hands and knees, then went to one knee, and balanced himself with his fist.\n\nHe finally stood up and wobbled toward the medics, signaling for a cup of water. Then, he left in a wheelchair.\n\n\"It definitely was an effect,\" Lyles said. \"But I mean, to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything for coming out and getting the bronze medal with COVID.\"\n\nThis bronze medal feels different than the last one\n\nIt will take time for all the repercussions of this race to play out.\n\nThere's still a chance Lyles could end up as the bigger-than-track superstar he set out to become after his disappointment in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThose Games, staged in front of no fans while the COVID pandemic raged, took a mental-health toll on Lyles, one he said made him less than himself and led to his disappointing finish in Tokyo.\n\nAfter he won the 100 Sunday night, he took that Tokyo bronze medal out during his news conference, dropped it on the table and explained it was the thing that motivated him to become a new person and a new sprinter for this Olympic cycle.\n\nThe 100-meter thriller sealed the first half of the deal. But instead of breezing through the 200, just getting to the starting line became a product of \"trying to get me on as much medication as we legally could to make sure that my body was able to just keep the momentum going.\"\n\nLyles posts that he likely won't run in the 4x100 relay\n\nAs Thursday turned to Friday in Paris, Lyles took to social media and posted his thanks to fans for their supportive messages and his congratulations to Tebogo and Bednarek.\n\nHe also said \"I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics,\" where he was supposed to run the anchor leg in the final of the men's 4x100 on Friday.\n\n\"It is not the Olympic I dreamed of but it has left me with so much Joy in my heart,\" he wrote. \"I hope everyone enjoyed the show. Whether you were rooting for me or against me, you have to admit you watched, didn't you?\"\n\nThe spectacle Lyles headlined struck a sobering chord at a revitalized Olympics that were supposed to be all about the return of fans and the return of the Games as we used to know them.\n\nLyles reminded us that there will never be a \"post-COVID\" Games.\n\nA javelin gold for Pakistan, and silver for India\n\nPakistan's Arshad Nadeem put together the best meet of his life in winning the men's javelin at Stade de France.\n\nNadeem set a new Olympic record in winning gold. His throw of 92.97 meters in his second attempt smashed the old mark of 90.57 set by Andreas Thorkildsen of Norway in 2008.\n\nIndia's Neeraj Chopra, the 2020 Olympic champion, took silver at 89.45 meters, a season best.", "source": {"uri": "mb.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manila Bulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type":

An hour after that shock, Americans Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone lowered her world record for the sixth time, finishing the 400-meter hurdles in 50.37 seconds for another Olympic blowout.\n\nLyles seemed like a sure thing, until things got weird the night before coming into Paris, Lyles, the three-time world champion with the American record and the world's best time of 2024 on his resume, had seemed like as sure a thing in the 200m as any single athlete at track this side of McLaughlin-Levrone.\n\nAfter opening with a scintillating win in the 100m four nights earlier, he was trying to become the first man to complete the 100-200 double since Usain Bolt did it eight years ago.\n\nA troubling sign, however, came the night before when Lyles finished second in his semifinal heat, also to Tebogo. It marked the first time he had lost a 200-meter race of any sort since his disappointing third-place finish in Tokyo.\n\nHe also hurried out of the stadium after that loss and went to the medical tent -- a rare occasion when he didn't stop to talk to reporters. His coach said he was fine.\n\nLyles said he tested positive two days after the 100m final. Turns out he wasn't. Lyles said he tested positive early Tuesday (August 6, 2024) morning and quickly got into quarantine.\n\nHe drank fluids, rested as much as possible and tried to gear up for the race. USATF said in a statement that Lyles was given \"a thorough medical evaluation\" and chose to compete.\n\n\"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely,\" the statement said.\n\nThe scene after the race was jarring. Usually one of the most energetic guys on the track, both before and after any sprint, Lyles collapsed, rolled onto his side and gasped for breath. He turned over on his hands and knees, then went to one knee, and balanced himself with his fist.\n\nHe finally stood up and wobbled toward the medics, signaling for a cup of water. Then, he left in a wheelchair.\n\n\"It definitely was an effect,\" Lyles said. \"But I mean, to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything for coming out and getting the bronze medal with COVID. This bronze medal feels different than the last one. It will take time for all the repercussions of this race to play out.\"\n\nAfter he won the 100 Sunday (August 4, 2024) night, he took that Tokyo bronze medal out during his news conference, dropped it on the table and explained it was the thing that motivated him to become a new person and a new sprinter for this Olympic cycle.\n\nThe 100-meter thriller sealed the first half of the deal. But instead of breezing through the 200, just getting to the starting line became a product of \"trying to get me on as much medication as we legally could to make sure that my body was able to just keep the momentum going.\"\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_McLaughlin-Levrone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Track_&_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Track & Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/400_metres_hurdles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "400 metres hurdles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/f0zlaj/article68504547.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Paris_Olympics_Athletics_37134.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803203", "eventUri": "eng-9803203", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

He suggested that his more laid-back demeanour means he wouldn't be able to reach Lyles' levels of fame.\n\nThe comment drew a wry smile from the USA's Kenny Bednarek, who was sitting beside Tebogo after winning silver and also coming in front of Lyles.\n\nBefore the race, Lyles predicted that he would take the gold and complete a double of the 100m and 200m, adding that \"when I come off the turn, they will be depressed\".\n\n\"I'll be winning,\" he later said when asked about the race.\n\nAs he came out onto the track before the race, Lyles was seen jumping around and shouting as he tried to work the crowd, similarly to how he did before the 100m final.\n\nBut the American could only labour to a bronze medal in an entertaining race that saw Botswana's Tebogo take gold in 19.46 seconds, with Lyles' compatriot Bednarek running 19.62 to Lyles 19.70.\n\nSoon after the race, Lyles was seen in a wheelchair, and US Track and Field soon revealed that he had been diagnosed with Covid-19 two days prior to the race.\n\n\"I woke up early about 5am Tuesday morning, feeling really horrible. I knew it was more than being sore from the 100. My first thought was not to panic, I've been in worse situations, I've been in worse conditions,\" said Lyles when speaking to NBC.\n\n\"I took it day by day, tried to hydrate as much [as possible]. It would say it has taken its toll, for sure, but I have never been more proud of myself coming out here and getting a bronze,\" he added.\n\nIn an Instagram post made after the race, Lyles appeared to confirm that he wouldn't run in the 4x100m relay, stating: \"I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics.\n\n\"It is not the Olympics I dreamed of but it has left me with so much Joy in my heart.

Botswana's First-ever Gold Medallist Let Talent Do The Talking, Writes OLIVER HOLT - Ny Breaking News", "body": "When you're the fastest man on earth, life comes at you fast.\n\nNoah Lyles, recently crowned Olympic champion in the men's 100 meters, leapt and skipped out of the tunnel for the start of the 200 meter final on Thursday evening.\n\nHe waved his arms in the air and shouted his brilliance to the crowd, preparing for the next step in his bid to establish himself as Usain Bolt's successor.\n\nAfter just 19.46 seconds, Lyles was in third place, behind Botswana's first Olympic gold medalist, Letsile Tebogo, and fellow countryman Kenny Bednarek.\n\nAfter collapsing on the court, Lyles immediately told the world that he had been suffering from Covid for the past three days.\n\nNoah Lyles came bursting, jumping and skipping out of the tunnel for the 200m final\n\nLyles, right, then lagged behind as Botswana's Letsile Tebogo, centre, stormed to gold\n\nThe new 100m Olympic champion revealed after the race that he has been suffering from Covid\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nOne can regret his illness and the impact it had on him, but also regret the sloppiness with which he cost Tebogo the show with an apology.\n\n\"It definitely affected my performance,\" Lyles said. \"I'm more proud of myself than anything. That I got the bronze medal with Covid.\"\n\nTebogo's victory was a moving story in itself. It came just months after the death of his mother and inspiration, Seratiwa.\n\nTebogo's mother accompanied him to Budapest in 2023, where he won a silver medal behind Lyles in the 100 meters at the world championships.\n\n\"Letsile is not a man of many words,\" Seratiwa said shortly before she died, making him the opposite of Lyles.\n\nHowever, on Thursday evening, Tebogo dedicated his victory to his mother and showed his talent with his performance.\n\nTebogo was so comfortable at the front that he started beating his chest with his palm before he even crossed the finish line. Does that remind you of anyone? If there was one sprinter who had a claim to Bolt's title of honor at the Stade de France, it wasn't Lyles.\n\n\"Comparing anyone to anyone else is the lazy man's view,\" Lyles said recently about being compared to Bolt.\n\nLyles' comments appeared to be the undoing of Botswana's first Olympic champion\n\nTebogo felt so comfortable at the front that he started beating his chest with his palm before he even crossed the finish line\n\nTebogo's victory comes a few months after the death of his mother and inspiration, Seratiwa\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nBut the truth is that he invites those comparisons by claiming that Bolt is the greatest showman in athletics.\n\nBolt has always backed up his bravado, winning the 100m-200m double at the 2008 Beijing, 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympics.\n\nLyles may be even more outgoing than Bolt, and his pre-start antics may be even wilder and he may talk more than the great Jamaican, but he is far from the heir to his throne.\n\nHe's had a fantastic Games here in Paris. A gold medal in the 100m -- the race he calls his mistress -- and now a bronze medal in the 200m -- the race he calls his wife -- is an achievement.\n\nThe point is, whatever your excuse, if you aim high, if you win the 100 meters and say, 'My God, I'm incredible,' then you have to deliver.\n\n\"I'm pretty confident,\" Lyles said ahead of the 200m final. \"I can't lie. I'm going to win. When they come out of the corner, they're going to be depressed. If you say that, you better back it up.\n\nLyles couldn't do it. He's a brilliant athlete, but he's not a phenomenon like Bolt. The same goes for Jakob Ingebrigtsen. A superstar, but far too fallible to be remembered as the greatest of all time.\n\nAs Tebogo celebrated becoming the first-ever African winner of the men's 200 metres at the Olympics, Lyles lay flat on his back, gasping for breath, just metres from the finish line.\n\nLyles may be more outgoing than Usain Bolt, but he is still far from inheriting his title\n\nLyles, like Jakob Ingebrigtsen, remains a superstar, but both are too fallible to be remembered as the best of all time\n\nRumors soon spread that USA Track and Field had said Lyles was suffering from Covid and teammate Bednarek said he had heard his fellow American \"had some kind of illness\"\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe man dubbed The Big Noise by one publication was now silent and struggled to stand, eventually pulling himself to one knee and remaining there for a while.\n\nHe tried to walk back to the athletes' tunnel, but couldn't. He crashed into a wall and asked for help from the medical staff.\n\nSeveral people crowded around him, helped him into a wheelchair and pushed him out of the stadium. A Paris 2024 spokesman said Lyles was unable to walk away on his own.\n\nRumors soon circulated that USA Track and Field had said Lyles was suffering from Covid-19 and Bednarek said he had heard his fellow American \"had some kind of illness.\"\n\nAfter the race, Lyles confirmed that he had tested positive for Covid in the early morning hours of Tuesday and had been in quarantine at a hotel since then to recover.\n\nHe said he had already regained some of his energy on Thursday, but he didn't want to tell anyone about his illness. He didn't want to give his rivals a head start before the race.\n\n\"I've had better days,\" Lyles said afterward, \"but I'm walking around again. I was pretty dizzy after that race.\n\n\"The chest pain was definitely active. But after a while I got my breathing back and I was back to my senses. I feel a lot better now.\"\n\nLyles admitted to experiencing chest pains and said he felt dizzy after the 200-meter final\n\nThe American failed to join the greats in completing the Olympic sprint double\n\nWhatever the reason for his achievements, whether it was his shortcomings, his illness or the genius of Tebogo, Lyles never came close to his rival.\n\nEarlier this week he had managed to win the 100 metres by five thousandths of a second, but this time he could not get Tebogo any closer than a mile.\n\nConsidering he was ill, it might have been wiser to conserve some energy rather than sprint out of the race tunnel like a man possessed by furies.\n\nHistory was at stake here, after all. Only nine men have ever won the sprint double at an Olympics, and it's an impressive list. Men like Jesse Owens, Valeriy Borzov, Carl Lewis and, of course, Bolt are on it, and Lyles was desperate to join them in the pantheon.\n\nAfter his double victory at the World Championships in Budapest, he wanted to win again here to seal his greatness.\n\nThe only double he achieved was a second bronze medal, in addition to the bronze medal he won at the 2021 Olympic Games in Tokyo.\n\nEarlier this week he had managed to win the 100 metres by five thousandths of a second, but this time he could not get closer than a country mile from Tebogo\n\nA second gold of these Games never seemed to be in sight. Lyles was slow out of the blocks, as so often happens, and he never threatened to close the gap on Tebogo.\n\nAs the race flattened out after the corner, it became clear how much work Lyles had to put in to catch the man from Botswana.\n\nHe was unable to close the gap and Tebogo flew across the finish line, carried by shoes with his mother's date of birth on them.\n\n\"I kind of carry her through every step I take on the field,\" the new champion said. \"Me, to take her, it gives me a lot of motivation. She looks up there and she's really, really happy.\"", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NY Breaking News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

When I come off the turn, they will be depressed,' he said.\n\nHowever, that prediction aged poorly as Lyles labored to a third-place finish and was placed in a wheelchair moments after the race, clearly out of breath from his Covid diagnosis.\n\nHe later revealed that his Olympics were likely over as he took to Instagram to thank fans for their support.\n\nLyles had been set to compete in the 4\u00d7100 relay but said he 'hope[d] everyone enjoyed the show.'\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nLyles (back left) crossed the line in third place, despite being the red-hot favorite for the race\n\nLyles was clearly struggling for breath after finishing third in the event on Thursday\n\nLyles told NBC, while masked up: 'I woke up early about 5am Tuesday morning, feeling really horrible. I knew it was more than being sore from the 100. My first thought was not to panic, I've been in worse situations, I've been in worse conditions.\n\n'I took it day by day, tried to hydrate as much. It would say it has taken its toll, for sure, but I have never been more proud of myself coming out here and getting a bronze.'\n\nLyles later said that the other competitors were unaware of his diagnosis: 'We tried to keep it close to our chest. The medical staff, my coach and my mom knew.\n\n'We didn't want everybody to go into a panic. We wanted to be able to compete. We wanted to be able to make it discreet as possible and you don't want to tell your competitors you are sick. Why would you give them an edge?'\n\nFor Tebogo, this was a particularly emotional night because it is only two months since he lost his mother, Seratiwa.\n\nThe 21-year-old did not train for a month, being struck with grief as he mourned the loss of his biggest cheerleader.\n\nAt the 2023 World Championships, Seratiwa had snuck in to the stands to watch Tebogo without him knowing.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheerleading", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cheerleading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803203", "eventUri": "eng-9803203", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Lyles, who was struggling with Covid symptoms, was helped into a wheelchair after collapsing post-race but still secured bronze. Lyles failed to claim gold in the 200m final after boldly claiming victory pre-race.\n\nAfter pulling off a shock 200m victory on Thursday to secure his first-ever Olympic gold medal at Paris 2024, Letsile Tebogo produced a biting critique of Noah Lyles in his post-race press conference.\n\nComing into the event, American sprinter Lyles was the clear favourite, having won the showpiece 100m event last week - and he made sure everyone knew it. Lyles had confidently told reporters that he would win before making a flashy entrance at the Stade de France, jumping around and waving at his fans.\n\nBut the American - who later revealed he had COVID - finished third in the race, with Tebogo leading the line. Afterward, the Botswana sprinter took aim at his US rival, branding him 'loud' and 'arrogant'.\n\nRelated Why Many Americans Don't Like Noah Lyles\n\nA controversial press conference from 2023 explains why a lot of Americans don't like the athlete.\n\nWhat Letsile Tebogo Said About Lyles He delivered a scathing review of the Team USA star\n\nThe newly-crowned 200m champion was asked whether he aspired to be the face of track and field, and claimed his more laid-back approach wouldn't allow him to get to Lyles' level of fame. He said:\n\n\"For me, I can't be the face of athletics because I'm not an arrogant or loud person like Noah.\"\n\n\"So I believe Noah's the face of athletics,\" the Botswana sprinter said to seemingly soften the blow of his initial punch. The remark caused Lyles' USA teammate, Kenny Bednarek, who claimed silver in the race, to briefly crack a wry smile.\n\nLyles brashly predicted before the 200m that he would complete the double after winning gold in the 100m in a nail-biting finish.\n\n\"...None of them is winning. When I come off the turn, they will be depressed,\" he said.\n\nNeedless to say, that sensational claim aged very poorly as Lyles was unable to finish inside the top two, instead being placed in a wheelchair, supposedly struggling with his COVID diagnosis. It led to him later revealing his summer could be over. Lyles had been set to compete in the 4x100 relay but said he 'hope[d] everyone enjoyed the show' on his Instagram.\n\nRelated Paris 2024 Olympics Medals Tracker\n\nStay up to date with the leading nations in the medal table at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\n5 Noah Lyles' Battle With COVID He was unable to walk after the race\n\nAfter the race, Lyles could be seen grasping for air and collapsing on the floor with some discomfort after posting a time of 19.70. He received medical assistance and would later be helped onto a wheelchair after being unable to leave of his own accord.\n\nAs many began to speculate what the athlete was suffering from, the 27-year-old's mother confirmed to NBC News that her son had fallen ill with the virus, having produced a positive test on Tuesday. The sprinter said: \"I woke up early at about 5am on Tuesday morning, feeling really horrible. I knew it was more than being sore from the 100. My first thought was not to panic. I've been in worse situations, I've been in worse conditions.\n\nRelated Noah Lyles Tests Positive For Covid Before Winning 200m Bronze Medal\n\nThe sprinter was escorted off the track by a wheelchair.\n\n\"I took it day by day, tried to hydrate as much. It would say it has taken its toll, for sure, but I have never been more proud of myself coming out here and getting a bronze.\"\n\n\"We didn't want everybody to go into a panic. We wanted to be able to compete. We wanted to be able to make it discreet as possible, and you don't want to tell your competitors you are sick. Why would you give them an edge?\"", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/tebogo_720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803203", "eventUri": "eng-9803203", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Just two days before competing in the 200-meter final, Lyles tested positive for COVID-19, an illness that would ultimately compromise his performance and lead to an emotional conclusion to his Olympic journey.\n\nRead More: Pakistan's Arshad Nadeem breaks Olympic record with 92.97m throw in javelin final\n\nThe 27-year-old sprinter, who had been on track to achieve a historic 100m-200m double, was determined to compete despite his diagnosis. Lyles, a three-time world champion in the 200 meters and current American record holder, had never considered withdrawing from the event, even as the virus took its toll on his body.\n\nIn a dramatic scene at Stade de France on Thursday night, Lyles finished third in the 200-meter final, securing a bronze medal behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo and his American teammate Kenny Bednarek. Lyles' time of 19.70 seconds was far from his best, a clear indication of the impact COVID-19 had on his performance. After crossing the finish line, Lyles collapsed on the track, overcome by exhaustion and shortness of breath. Medical staff quickly attended to him, eventually transporting him off the track in a wheelchair.\n\nDespite the obvious physical toll, Lyles remained defiant. In an interview with NBC, he expressed pride in his ability to compete and secure a medal despite the illness. \"I'm more proud of myself than anything - coming out and getting a bronze medal with COVID,\" Lyles said. He later reflected on the experience in a social media post, writing, \"It is not the Olympic I dreamed of, but it has left me with so much joy in my heart.\"\n\nLyles first experienced symptoms of COVID-19 in the early hours of Tuesday morning, just 24 hours after his thrilling victory in the 100 meters. His symptoms, which included aches, chills, and a sore throat, led to immediate testing, confirming his fears. Lyles was quickly quarantined in a hotel near the Olympic Village, and his team worked to manage his symptoms as much as possible. Lyles confirmed he was taking Paxlovid, an antiviral medication, to help mitigate the effects of the virus.\n\nThroughout this ordeal, Lyles kept his condition hidden from his competitors and teammates. He explained that revealing his illness could have given others a psychological advantage, something he was unwilling to concede. \"Why would you give them an edge over you?\" Lyles remarked.\n\nWith his Olympic aspirations curtailed by illness, Lyles announced that his 2024 Games were over. His participation in the upcoming 4\u00d7100-meter relay, where he had been expected to help the U.S. team vie for gold, was no longer possible. The news marked a bittersweet end to what had begun as a promising Olympic campaign.\n\nRead More: Arshad Nadeem makes Pakistan proud, wins gold medal at Olympics after 30 years\n\nDespite the disappointment, Lyles chose to focus on the positives. He took to Instagram to thank his supporters and reflect on the experience. \"I hope everyone enjoyed the show.

I tested positive around 5am on Tuesday. I felt real cold in the middle of the night, sore, sore throat and many other symptoms I had before covid.\n\n\"It definitely affected my performance.

Whether you're for me or against me, you have to admit you saw it, don't you?\"\n\nLyles was aiming to complete a rare triple of 100m, 200m and 4x100m gold at the same Olympics. Only four men have won the triple in the same Games and after winning the 100m crown by five thousandths of a second in a dramatic photo finish on Monday night, Lyles was still hoping to join American legends Jesse Owens (1936) and Bobby Morrow. (1956) and Carl Lewis (1984), as well as Jamaica's Usain Bolt (2012 and 2016) are on the list.\n\nBut - just like in his semi-final the night before - Lyles never caught Tepoko coming off the curve to push him back.\n\nTepoko became the first African to win the title - an African record - and in doing so earned Botswana's first Olympic gold medal.\n\nFormer US Olympic champion Michael Johnson challenged the notion that Lyles was injured while on punditry work for the BBC - before news of the Covid diagnosis filtered out.\n\n\"He's definitely not carrying an injury because you can't do this with an injury, you can't run 19.70,\" he said.\n\n\"If anything, there's some sort of illness that saps his energy from being able to carry that momentum all the way through.\"\n\nShortly after, US Track and Field (USATF) broke the news that the bronze medalist ran the race after testing positive for Covid.\n\nA USADF statement said: \"We can confirm that Noah Lyles tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. In response, the USOPC and USATF quickly implemented all necessary protocols to prioritize his health, the well-being of our team, and the safety of our fellow competitors.\n\n\"Ensuring the safety of Team USA athletes is our number one commitment. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will monitor his condition closely.\n\n\"As an organization, we strictly follow the IOC guidelines on respiratory diseases to prevent the spread of disease among team members and protect their health and performance.\"\n\nDeboko, who won bronze at last year's world championships, set a national record of 9.86 seconds when she finished sixth in the 100m final in Paris. Bednarek chased him down in 19.62 seconds to claim his second consecutive silver.\n\nLyles and Bednarek were set to team up in the men's 4\u00d7100 relay, where the U.S. would have been strong favorites to win gold and take the crown from Italy, who shocked the world in Tokyo, but Lyles' apparent withdrawal gives other nations a greater chance.

He suggested that his more laid-back demeanour means he wouldn't be able to reach Lyles' levels of fame.\n\nThe comment drew a wry smile from the USA's Kenny Bednarek, who was sitting beside Tebogo after winning silver and also coming in front of Lyles.\n\nBefore the race, Lyles predicted that he would take the gold and complete a double of the 100m and 200m, adding that \"when I come off the turn, they will be depressed\".\n\n\"I'll be winning,\" he later said when asked about the race.\n\nAs he came out onto the track before the race, Lyles was seen jumping around and shouting as he tried to work the crowd, similarly to how he did before the 100m final.\n\nBut the American could only labour to a bronze medal in an entertaining race that saw Botswana's Tebogo take gold in 19.46 seconds, with Lyles' compatriot Bednarek running 19.62 to Lyles 19.70.\n\nSoon after the race, Lyles was seen in a wheelchair, and US Track and Field soon revealed that he had been diagnosed with Covid-19 two days prior to the race.\n\n\"I woke up early about 5am Tuesday morning, feeling really horrible. I knew it was more than being sore from the 100.

It would say it has taken its toll, for sure, but I have never been more proud of myself coming out here and getting a bronze,\" he added.\n\nIn an Instagram post made after the race, Lyles appeared to confirm that he wouldn't run in the 4x100m relay, stating: \"I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics.\n\n\"It is not the Olympics I dreamed of but it has left me with so much Joy in my heart.

Why the American sprinter was allowed to compete in the race despite having the illness has now been revealed. Not only that, but how Lyles kept the diagnosis a secret has also been revealed.\n\nIt has certainly been a whirlwind week for Team USA's Noah Lyles. After securing his position as the fastest man on the planet with an unbelievable victory in one of the closest Olympic 100m finals we have ever seen, he took to the track again on the 8th of August looking to complete a famous double by winning the 200m final.\n\nThe pressure and eyes were all on Lyles, who has not shied away from expressing his confidence in his own ability. In fact, you may remember a clip of him going massively viral last year when he was laughing at the fact that the winners of the NBA Championship described themselves as \"world champions\", despite it being a national competition, with Lyles expressing that the only true world champions are athletes like himself. This did not go down well with a lot of US fans, leading to even more eyes on him going into these Olympic Games.\n\nLast night's 200m final did not end the way Lyles would have hoped, with the winner being Botswana's Letsile Tebogo, and fellow US compatriot Kenny Bednarek taking silver, leaving Lyles in bronze medal position in third place. Despite this still being an incredible achievement, Lyles had high expectations for himself, but was quick to explain a key reason for his lacklustre performance in his post-race interviews.\n\nLyles revealed that he was diagnosed with COVID on Tuesday, just 48 hours before the 200m final was set to take place. He described how he felt light-headed and was dealing with chest pains throughout the build up to the race, but said he never had any intention of not taking part.\n\nCOVID Rules at the Paris Olympics\n\nThe question on most people's minds was why Lyles was allowed to compete with COVID. To put it simply, the Paris Games do not have any protocols in place when it comes to athletes being diagnosed with the illness. We have already seen it with Team GB's Adam Peaty, who contracted COVID early on in the Games and still swam a few days later.\n\nIt was revealed that Lyles had been training away from his teammates and wearing a mask during his daily activities, but outside of that, there was nothing stopping him competing. The world is in a much different place now when it comes to the virus, with the American almost certainly not being able to compete if this was at the 2021 Tokyo Games.\n\nHow Noah Lyles Kept COVID Diagnosis Secret\n\nLyles would go into further detail, explaining how he and his team managed to keep this a secret from almost everyone around them. He described how only his mother and a few medical personnel knew he had contracted the virus, with his own teammates not even aware until it was revealed after the race.\n\nAgain, the lack of protocols when it comes to COVID at these Games would have made it a lot easier to keep under wraps, with no obligations to let anyone know. Lyles stated he did not want any competitors to have an edge over him by knowing this news, and it also would have opened himself up to make excuses for his performance, which he did not want.\n\nSpeaking on the diagnosis, Lyles said: \"We were trying to keep this as close to the chest as possible. You never want to tell your competitors you're sick; why would you give them an edge over you? I'd definitely say it's taken its toll, for sure. But I've never been more proud of myself for being able to come out here and get a bronze medal.\"\n\nThis whole issue really just highlights where we are now at with this virus in the sporting world and wider world. It is manageable but still very present.\n\nRelated Fan Footage Shows Noah Lyles' Actions Before 200m Final\n\nOlympic sprinter Noah Lyles was loving the fans' reception before the 200m final, but should he have been behaving in that way with COVID?", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Peaty", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Peaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mixcollage-09-aug-2024-09-57-am-2724.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803203", "eventUri": "eng-9803203", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 563, "textEnd": 576}], "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

He sat on the side of the track for an extended period of time as medical personnel attended to him. Photographs and video from after the event showed him being taken off the track in a wheelchair.\n\nHe said in the interview, \"It's taken its toll for sure, but I've never been more proud of myself for being able to come out here and getting a bronze medal.\"\n\nHe said he quarantined as much as possible but never considered skipping the race.\n\nUSA Track & Field said in a statement: \"We can confirm that Noah Lyles tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday, August 6th. In response, the USOPC [U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee] and USATF swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritize his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors.\"\n\nIt continued, \"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nLyles is scheduled for one more race, the 4x100-meters relay, but he told NBC after the 200 meters he wasn't sure if he would compete in that event.\n\n\"I'm feeling more on the side of letting Team USA do their thing. They've proven with great certainty they can handle it without me,\" he said. \"If that's the case coming off today, I'm perfectly fine saying, 'Hey, you guys do your thing. You have more than enough speed to handle it and get the gold medal.'\"\n\nLater on Thursday, Lyles appeared to say in an Instagram post that he would not compete in that event, writing, \"I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics.\"\n\n\"It is not the Olympic I dreamed of but it has left me with so much Joy in my heart,\" Lyles wrote. \"I hope everyone enjoyed the show. Whether you were rooting for me or against me, you have to admit you watched, didn't you?

The American finished in third during the final, but after the race, revealed he had COVID-19. However, given his diagnosis, he probably shouldn've have been jumping around like he was before the race.\n\nNoah Lyles was aiming to complete the 100m and 200m sprint double at the Paris 2024 Olympics, similar to Jamaican legend Usain Bolt. The American has taken the sprinting world by storm in recent years, and no sooner had he landed the 100m gold medal, than he was announcing his next big goal. \"I want my own sneakers,\" he proclaimed. \"Even Michael Johnson didn't have his own sneakers.\"\n\nIt's probably easier to compare him to a certain Usain Bolt. Lyles is the best thing to happen to athletics since the world's fastest man exited the stage in 2017. And now the world champion is also the Olympic champion, he can go on to transcend track and field just like the Jamaican legend did before him.\n\nNoah Lyles Eyed Gold Double After securing the 100m gold, he wanted the 200m gold\n\nHe was looking to take home the 200m gold as well as the 100m, and going into the final, was the pre-race favourite. And the crowd inside the Stade de France were waiting excitedly with bated breath to see if Lyles could achieve his goal.\n\nHe was given his introduction, and instead of simply walking or jogging to his blocks, he ran out, jumping up and down, clearly wanting to feed off the energy inside the stadium. And the crowd gave it to him, willing him on before the race had even begun.\n\nUnfortunately for Lyles, it wasn't to be. He would have to settle for the bronze medal this time, finishing third behind fellow American Kenneth Bednarek and the race winner, Botswana's Letsile Tebogo.\n\nNoah Lyles Reveals COVID Diagnosis\n\nAfter the race finished, Lyles, in his post-race interview, revealed that he had tested positive for COVID-19 before the final, and he was helped out of the arena in a wheelchair, a disappointing end after an electric start. It was also revealed that he will not compete for Team USA in the sprint relays.\n\nOnly a small number of people knew about the COVID situation. His mother and his medical team. He had quarantined at the USA team hotel in the nights before the final, and the other runners in the final were unaware.\n\nLyles confirmed the news, saying: \"I do have COVID. I tested positive around 5am on Tuesday morning. I woke up in the middle of the night feeling real chills, aching, a sore throat, and those were a lot of the symptoms I've had right before getting COVID.\n\n\"It definitely affected my performance. I've had to take a lot of breaks... I was coughing through the night. I'm more proud of myself than anything, coming out here to get a bronze with COVID. I've had better days, but I'm walking around again. I was quite light-headed after that race. Shortness of breath, chest pain, but after a while I could catch my breath and get my wits about me. I'm a lot better now.\"\n\nThough Lyles earned bronze, ESPN's Coley Harvey reported that he was given a yellow card for violating Technical Rule 7.1, which falls under \"improper conduct.\" Why he was given the penalty is still unclear.\n\nRelated Letsile Tebogo Delivers Savage Verdict on 'Arrogant' and 'Loud' Noah Lyles\n\nAfter beating the overly-confident Noah Lyles to gold in the 200m sprint at the Paris Olympics, Letsile Tebogo didn't hold back about his opponent.\n\nDespite the setback, Lyles remains an endearing personality, one of an elite level of sports participants who can attract

I'm more proud of myself than anything, coming out here to get a bronze with Covid.\n\n\"I was quite light-headed after that race. Shortness of breath, chest pain, but after a while I could catch my breath and get my wits about me. I'm a lot better now.\"\n\nLyles had been expected to run in the 4x100m and 4x400m relay races but in a later post on social media, he wrote: \"I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics.\n\n\"It is not the Olympics I dreamed of but it has left me with so much joy in my heart - I hope everyone enjoyed the show.\"\n\nAll seemed well when Lyles produced his usual theatrics as he excited the crowd before attempting to become only the 10th man to win 100m and 200m gold at a single Games.\n\nLyles, who won three world titles last year, began his pursuit of what would have been a potential four golds with a sensational 100m triumph. He beat Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in a dramatic photo finish to edge what has been described as the fastest 100m race in history - with the slowest of the eight finalists clocking an impressive 9.91 seconds.\n\nBut, after making only the sixth-fastest start in the 200m final, Lyles was unable to make up ground on Tebogo and spent almost the entire race in third, crossing the line behind US silver medallist Kenneth Bednarek.\n\nIt only became apparent just how much Lyles was struggling once he finished, appearing short of breath before he was helped into a wheelchair after being pictured lying flat-out on the track.\n\n\"We were trying to keep this close to the chest,\" said Lyles.\n\n\"The people who knew were the medical staff, my coach, my mum. We didn't want everybody going into a panic.\n\n\"I'm competitive. Why would you give [your rivals] an edge over you?\"\n\nLyles, who embraced fellow athletes including Tebogo, said he had tested positive at around 5am on Tuesday after waking up in the night and experiencing symptoms including aching, chills and a sore throat.\n\nHe quarantined in a hotel close to the Olympic Village with his team, who he said \"tried to get me on as much medication as we legally could to make sure my body could keep the momentum going\".\n\n\"I still wanted to run, it was still possible, we just stayed away from everybody,\" Lyles said.\n\n\"This is by far the best day I've felt out of the last three days. Still not 100% but closer to 90 to 95%.\n\n\"That only works for one shot. I've got to settle down for a while. It's one and done, there's no holding back.\"\n\nDefeat in the 200m ended Lyles' ambitious hopes of winning four gold medals in Paris, having had plans to add the 4x400m relay to the world 100m, 200m and 4x100m treble he achieved 12 months ago.\n\nThe 4x100m final takes place on Friday at 18:47 BST, with the 4x400m final held on Saturday at 20:00 BST.\n\nLyles earlier said \"we haven't decided yet\" regarding his participation in the relays and that he would have a \"very honest and transparent chat with the coaches\".\n\nHe added: \"No matter what happens, this 4x100m team can handle everything. I've been with them in practice, I know they can come out with a win, break as many records as they put their mind to.\"\n\nAt the Tokyo Games three years ago, postponed from 2020 by the coronavirus pandemic, athletes had to compete in empty stadiums and maintain strict social distancing to tackle the spread of infections.\n\nIn Paris, while the virus has not disappeared, things have largely returned to normal.\n\nCovid is now treated like other respiratory illnesses, with no strict protocols which prevent athletes from competing.\n\nUSA Track and Field (USATF) told BBC Sport that it and the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) \"swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritise his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors\" after learning of Lyles' positive test.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely,\" USATF said.\n\n\"As an organisation, we are rigorously adhering to CDC [Centres for Disease Control and Prevention], USOPC, and IOC [International Olympic Committee] guidelines for respiratory illnesses to prevent the spread of illness among team members, safeguarding their health and performance.\"\n\nEarlier in the Games, Great Britain's Adam Peaty tested positive for Covid-19 one day after winning 100m breaststroke silver, but returned to action in the pool five days later.

I tested positive around 5am on Tuesday morning. I woke up in the middle of the night feeling real chills, aching, sore throat, and those were a lot of the symptoms I've had right before getting Covid.\n\n\"It definitely affected my performance. I've had to take a lot of breaks... I was coughing through the night. I'm more proud of myself than anything, coming out here to get a bronze with Covid.\n\n\"I've had better days, but I'm walking around again. I was quite light-headed after that race. Shortness of breath, chest pain, but after a while I could catch my breath and get my wits about me. I'm a lot better now.\"\n\nLyles revealed he was quarantined in a hotel near the Olympic village after testing positive. \"We were trying to keep this close to the chest,\" he said.\n\n\"The people who knew were the medical staff, coach, my mum. We didn't want everybody going into a panic, we wanted them to be able to compete.\n\n\"We wanted to make this as free as possible. I'm competitive. Why would you give them an edge over you?\"\n\nIn an Instagram post after the race, Lyles then appeared to confirm he wouldn't be trying to help Team USA win 4x100m relay gold on Friday.\n\nHe wrote: \"I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics. It is not the Olympics I dreamed of but it has left me with so much Joy in my heart. I hope everyone enjoyed the show. Whether you were rooting for me or against me, you have to admit you watched, didn't you?\"\n\nLyles was aiming to complete a rare treble of 100m, 200m and 4x100m golds at the same Olympics. Only four men have won the triple at the same Games and, after winning the 100m crown by five-thousandths of a second in a dramatic photo finish on Monday night, Lyles still had hopes of joining American greats Jesse Owens (1936), Bobby Morrow (1956) and Carl Lewis (1984), as well as Jamaica's Usain Bolt (2012 and 2016), on the list.\n\nBut - just like his semi-final the previous night - Lyles came off the bend trailing Tebogo and never caught him.\n\nTebogo became the first African to win the title - setting an African record - and in doing so claimed Botswana's first Olympic gold medal.\n\nFormer US Olympic great Michael Johnson challenged the notion of Lyles having an injury while on punditry duties for the BBC - before news of the Covid diagnosis filtered through.\n\n\"He certainly isn't carrying an injury because you can't do this with an injury, you can't run 19.70,\" he said.\n\n\"If there's anything, there's some sort of illness that has zapped his energy from the ability to actually carry that speed all the way through.\"\n\nShortly afterwards, US Track and Field (USATF) broke the news that the bronze medallist ran the race after testing positive for Covid.\n\nA USATF statement read: \"We can confirm that Noah Lyles tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. In response, the USOPC and USATF swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritize his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\n\n\"As an organisation, we are rigorously adhering to... IOC guidelines for respiratory illnesses to prevent the spread of illness among team members, safeguarding their health and performance.\"\n\nTebogo, who won bronze at the worlds last year and set a national record of 9.86s when finishing sixth in the Paris 100m final, produced a dominant run to become the fifth-fastest man in history over 200m. Bednarek chased him all the way to take a second successive silver in 19.62s.\n\nLyles and Bednarek were set to team up for the men's 4x100 relay in which the USA would have been strong favourites to win gold and take the crown from Italy, who shocked the world in Tokyo, but Lyles's apparent withdrawal gives other nations more of a chance to pinch the Olympic title away from the Americans.",

The American said that his Paris Games were over, hours after he needed medical attention and was taken off the track with a wheel-chair on August 8, Thursday. Lyles leaves as an Olympic champion, but an abrupt end to his campaign would be a bitter pill to swallow, as he had set the ambitious goal of winning four golds in Paris, in the 100m, 200m, 4x100m relay and the 4x400m relay. It was also the first time in three years when the triple 200m world champion could not win gold in this category.\n\n\"I do have Covid,\" Lyles told the reporters on Thursday. \"I tested positive around 5am on Tuesday. I woke up feeling chills, aching, sore throat. Those were a lot of the symptoms I have had before getting Covid. I was like: 'I need to test this one.' It came back positive so we quickly quarantined in a hotel near the village and they got me on as much medication as they legally could to make sure my body was able to keep the momentum going.\n\nIt means Lyles, the 100m world champion, will play no part when the US quartet attempt to win 4x100m relay gold on Friday.\n\n\"I still wanted to run, they said it was still possible so we stayed away from everybody and took it round by round. I have definitely had better days but I am walking around again. I was quite light headed after that race and the chest pain was definitely active. After a while I was able to catch my breath and get my wits about me. I am feeling a lot better now.\"\n\nBotswana's Letsile Tebogo won gold (19.46) and USA's Kenneth Bednarek bagged silver (19.62) and Lyles reached the finishing line in 19.70 seconds to bag bronze.\n\nIn a statement, USA Track & Field said: \"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nDespite missing out on gold medal, Noah was content with finishing third while being Covid-stricken.\n\n\"It definitely affected my performance,\" Lyles said. \"I had to take a lot of breaks [to receive] fluid. \u00e2\u0080\u00e6 To be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything.

I'm more proud of myself than anything, coming out here to get a bronze with Covid.\n\n\"I was quite light-headed after that race. Shortness of breath, chest pain, but after a while I could catch my breath and get my wits about me. I'm a lot better now.\"\n\nLyles had been expected to run in the 4x100m and 4x400m relay races but in a later post on social media, he wrote: \"I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics.\n\n\"It is not the Olympics I dreamed of but it has left me with so much joy in my heart - I hope everyone enjoyed the show.\"\n\nAll seemed well when Lyles produced his usual theatrics as he excited the crowd before attempting to become only the 10th man to win 100m and 200m gold at a single Games.\n\nLyles, who won three world titles last year, began his pursuit of what would have been a potential four golds with a sensational 100m triumph. He beat Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in a dramatic photo finish to edge what has been described as the fastest 100m race in history - with the slowest of the eight finalists clocking an impressive 9.91 seconds.\n\nBut, after making only the sixth-fastest start in the 200m final, Lyles was unable to make up ground on Tebogo and spent almost the entire race in third, crossing the line behind US silver medallist Kenneth Bednarek.\n\nIt only became apparent just how much Lyles was struggling once he finished, appearing short of breath before he was helped into a wheelchair after being pictured lying flat-out on the track.\n\n\"We were trying to keep this close to the chest,\" said Lyles.\n\n\"The people who knew were the medical staff, my coach, my mum. We didn't want everybody going into a panic.\n\n\"I'm competitive. Why would you give [your rivals] an edge over you?\"\n\nLyles, who embraced fellow athletes including Tebogo, said he had tested positive at around 5am on Tuesday after waking up in the night and experiencing symptoms including aching, chills and a sore throat.\n\nHe quarantined in a hotel close to the Olympic Village with his team, who he said \"tried to get me on as much medication as we legally could to make sure my body could keep the momentum going\".\n\n\"I still wanted to run, it was still possible, we just stayed away from everybody,\" Lyles said.\n\n\"This is by far the best day I've felt out of the last three days. Still not 100% but closer to 90 to 95%.\n\n\"That only works for one shot. I've got to settle down for a while. It's one and done, there's no holding back.\"\n\nDefeat in the 200m ended Lyles' ambitious hopes of winning four gold medals in Paris, having had plans to add the 4x400m relay to the world 100m, 200m and 4x100m treble he achieved 12 months ago.\n\nThe 4x100m final takes place on Friday at 18:47 BST, with the 4x400m final held on Saturday at 20:00 BST.\n\nLyles earlier said \"we haven't decided yet\" regarding his participation in the relays and that he would have a \"very honest and transparent chat with the coaches\".\n\nHe added: \"No matter what happens, this 4x100m team can handle everything. I've been with them in practice, I know they can come out with a win, break as many records as they put their mind to.\"\n\nWhat are the current Covid protocols in sport?\n\nAt the Tokyo Games three years ago, postponed from 2020 by the coronavirus pandemic, athletes had to compete in empty stadiums and maintain strict social distancing to tackle the spread of infections.\n\nIn Paris, while the virus has not disappeared, things have largely returned to normal.\n\nCovid is now treated like other respiratory illnesses, with no strict protocols which prevent athletes from competing.\n\nUSA Track and Field (USATF) told BBC Sport that it and the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) \"swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritise his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors\" after learning of Lyles' positive test.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely,\" USATF said.\n\n\"As an organisation, we are rigorously adhering to CDC [Centres for Disease Control and Prevention], USOPC, and IOC [International Olympic Committee] guidelines for respiratory illnesses to prevent the spread of illness among team members, safeguarding their health and performance.\"\n\nEarlier in the Games, Great Britain's Adam Peaty tested positive for Covid-19 one day after winning 100m breaststroke silver, but returned to action in the pool five days later.", "source": {"uri":

However, the Team USA star also announced that his Paris Olympics experience is likely over.\n\nThe American sprinter shared on Instagram on Thursday, after earning bronze in the 200-meter final, that he thinks his journey in Paris is over. He was expected to compete in the men's 4x100m relay final on Friday, but that now appears unlikely after his condition worsened following the 200m race at the Olympics on Thursday.\n\nEnd of the Show\n\nLyles, who disclosed that he tested positive before Thursday's race, shared an emotional message on Instagram where he also praised Letsile Tebogo and Kenny Bednarek, the gold and silver medalists, respectively.\n\n\"I want to thank everyone for the supportive messages,\" he said in his post which featured a picture of him kneeling down on the track in France.\n\n\"I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics. It is not the Olympic I dreamed of but it has left me with so much Joy in my heart. I hope everyone enjoyed the show. Whether you were rooting for me or against me, you have to admit you watched, didn't you?\n\n\"See you next time.\"\n\nLyles is likely wrapping up his time with two medals, having claimed gold in a thrilling 100-meter final over the weekend.\n\nNBC reported that they spoke with Lyles' mother, who confirmed that he had the virus before the athlete addressed it publicly. Lyles expressed no regrets about competing, even though it posed a potential risk of spreading the virus to other athletes, whom he hugged and shook hands with after the race.\n\nThe USA star told NBC, masked up: \"I woke up early about 5am Tuesday morning, feeling really horrible. I knew it was more than being sore from the 100. My first thought was not to panic, I've ben in worse situations, I've been in worse conditions.\n\n\"I took it day by day, tried to hydrate as much. It would say it has taken its toll, for sure, but I have never been more proud of myself coming out here and getting a bronze.\"\n\nLyles' Decision Questioned\n\nAfter the race, Lyles appeared exhausted and collapsed on the track, visibly struggling to breathe. Medics swiftly attended to the Team USA sprinter, taking him away in a wheelchair.\n\nIt was later disclosed that Lyles had Covid-19, despite hugging his teammate Bednarek after the finish.\n\nMichael Johnson questioned Lyles' decision to go ahead and compete, saying on the BBC: \"Very bizarre, Covid is still a dangerous disease. It is just bizarre, the whole thing is really weird.\n\n\"There is going to be all of this thing with the Noah haters out there - and he set himself up for it - there are going to be people out there saying it's not real and he's faking or whatever.\n\n\"But putting that aside, having Covid and still coming out here and being in close proximity with other people - I know there probably is not a policy I guess at these Games for that - but morally I'm not sure about it.\"\n\nThe USA star made his signature dramatic entrance to the race, jumping into the stadium as his name was announced and rallying the crowd for an event where many expected him to be the top contender.\n\nHowever, after being outpaced by Letsile Tebogo, who took gold, and fellow American Kenny Bednarek, Lyles was seen lying on the track, gasping for air after congratulating his competitors.\n\nShortly afterward, he was photographed being wheeled off the track in a wheelchair.

That was .39 off his personal-best, and .24 behind the 21-year-old Tebogo.\n\nLyles's US teammate Kenny Bednarek finished second, marking the second straight Olympics in which he and Lyles finished 2-3.\n\n\"When I saw Kenny fade, I knew Noah was far, far, far away behind us,\" Tebogo said.\n\n\"So that means I'm the Olympic champion.\"\n\nComing into Paris, Lyles, the three-time world champion with the American record and the world's best time of 2024 on his resume, had seemed like as sure a thing in the 200 as any single athlete at track this side of Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone.\n\nAfter opening with a scintillating win in the 100 four nights earlier, he was trying to become the first man to complete the 100-200 double since Usain Bolt eight years ago.\n\nA troubling sign, however, came the night before when Lyles finished second in his semifinal heat, also to Tebogo.\n\nIt marked the first time he had lost a 200m race of any sort since his disappointing third-place finish in Tokyo.\n\nHe also hurried out of the stadium after that loss and went to the medical tent -- a rare occasion when he didn't stop to talk to reporters.\n\nLyles said he tested positive early on Tuesday morning and quickly got into quarantine.\n\nHe drank fluids, rested as much as possible and tried to gear up for the race.\n\nUSATF said in a statement that Lyles was given \"a thorough medical evaluation\" and chose to compete.\n\n\"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely,\" the statement said.\n\nThe scene after the race was jarring.\n\nUsually one of the most energetic runners on the track, both before and after any sprint, Lyles collapsed, rolled onto his side and gasped for breath.\n\nHe turned over on his hands and knees, then went to one knee, and balanced himself with his fist.\n\nHe finally stood up and wobbled toward the medics, signalling for a cup of water.\n\nThen, he left in a wheelchair.\n\n\"But I mean, to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything for coming out and getting the bronze medal with COVID.\"", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors": [],

The gold medal was claimed by the 21-year-old Botswana runner Letsile Tebogo, who outpaced Lyles by .24 seconds\n\n.\n\nKenny Bednarek, Lyles's teammate from the United States, secured the silver medal. This marked the second consecutive Olympic Games in which Lyles and Bednarek achieved a 2-3 finish.\n\n\"When I saw Kenny fade, I knew Noah was far, far, far away behind us,\" Tebogo said, as quoted by The Associated Press. \"So that means I'm the Olympic champion.\"\n\nAfter opening his Paris campaign by a sensational win in the keenly-contested 100m race, Lyles, the reigning world champion in the 200m, aimed to replicate Usain Bolt's feat of winning both the 100m and 200m titles at a single Olympics, a double that hasn't been achieved since Bolt's triumph eight years ago.\n\nHowever, Lyles encountered a setback in the semifinals when he finished second to Tebogo, marking his first loss in a 200-meter race since his bronze medal performance in Tokyo.\n\nFollowing the semifinal defeat, Lyles swiftly exited the stadium and sought medical attention in the designated tent, an unusual occurrence as he typically engages with the media after his races. His coach assured that Lyles was in good health.\n\nLyles revealed that he had tested positive for COVID two days after securing victory in the 100m final and promptly entered quarantine. He focused on staying hydrated, getting ample rest and preparing himself mentally and physically for the upcoming race.\n\nUnited States Track and Field (USATF) confirmed that Lyles underwent \"a thorough medical evaluation\" and made the decision to compete despite the circumstances.\n\n\"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely,\" the statement said.\n\nThe aftermath of the race was unsettling.\n\nLyles, typically among the most vibrant athletes on the track, both prior to and following any sprint, succumbed to exhaustion. He fell to the ground, turning onto his side, struggling to catch his breath. Slowly, he maneuvered onto his hands and knees before rising to one knee, using his fist to maintain balance.\n\nAfter a moment, he managed to stand, unsteadily making his way towards the medical staff, gesturing for a drink of water. Ultimately, he departed the scene in a wheelchair.\n\n\"It definitely was an effect,\" Lyles said. \"But I mean, to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything for coming out and getting the bronze medal with COVID.\"\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

When I come off the turn, they will be depressed,' he said.\n\nHowever, that prediction aged poorly as Lyles labored to a third-place finish and was placed in a wheelchair moments after the race, clearly out of breath from his Covid diagnosis.\n\nHe later revealed that his Olympics were likely over as he took to Instagram to thank fans for their support.\n\nLyles had been set to compete in the 4\u00d7100 relay but said he 'hope[d] everyone enjoyed the show.'\n\nLyles told NBC, while masked up: 'I woke up early about 5am Tuesday morning, feeling really horrible. I knew it was more than being sore from the 100. My first thought was not to panic, I've been in worse situations, I've been in worse conditions.\n\n'I took it day by day, tried to hydrate as much. It would say it has taken its toll, for sure, but I have never been more proud of myself coming out here and getting a bronze.'\n\nLyles later said that the other competitors were unaware of his diagnosis: 'We tried to keep it close to our chest. The medical staff, my coach and my mom knew.\n\n'We didn't want everybody to go into a panic. We wanted to be able to compete. We wanted to be able to make it discreet as possible and you don't want to tell your competitors you are sick. Why would you give them an edge?'\n\nFor Tebogo, this was a particularly emotional night because it is only two months since he lost his mother, Seratiwa.\n\nThe 21-year-old did not train for a month, being struck with grief as he mourned the loss of his biggest cheerleader.\n\nAt the 2023 World Championships, Seratiwa had snuck in to the stands to watch Tebogo without him knowing.\n\nIn tribute to his mum, Tebogo wore shoes bearing his mother's date of birth.\n\n'It's basically me carrying her through every stride that I take,' he said. 'Me, to take her, it gives me a lot of motivation.\n\n'I didn't want to put the date of her death, because I'll get emotional. I took about a month without doing anything. It wasn't really clicking for me that she's really gone. For me, I have to find the reason why I started my athletics journey and why I should continue going on.\n\n'(If she were here) I believe she could be one of the happiest people on the planet because she believed in me when I doubted myself.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Letsile-Tebogo-delivers-savage-verdict-on-arrogant.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803203", "eventUri": "eng-9803203", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

He was \"breathing heavily\" after placing third in the race, an announcer said.\n\nAccording to Olympics.com, after coming in third in the 200m final, Lyles \"slumped to the ground\" after \"congratulating surprise winner Letsile Tebogo of Botswana and his American teammate Kenny Bednarek, who took silver.\"\n\nThen, NBC News' journalist Lewis Johnson announced that he had learned that Lyles tested positive for COVID on August 6.\n\nJohnson spoke with Lyles on camera. \"Yeah, I woke up early about 5 a.m. on Tuesday morning, and I just was feeling really horrible then. I knew it was more than being sore from the 100,\" Lyles told Johnson. According to NBC News, Lyles generated controversy when he won the gold medal in the 100 meters by .005 seconds over Kishane Thompson of Jamaica.\n\nHe said he took a test. \"Unfortunately it came up that I was positive for COVID. My first thought was not to panic. I've been in worse situations. I've run with, you know, worse conditions, I felt. We just took it day by day. Tried to hydrate as much. Quarantined off.\"\n\nHe said the virus had \"taken its toll for sure,\" but added, \"I've never been more proud of myself being able to come out here and get a bronze medal. Last Olympics, I was very disappointed. And this time, I couldn't be more proud.\"\n\nLyles told Johnson that he never considered not running the 200m final. \"I didn't,\" he said. \"We were just going to try to quarantine as much as possible, stay away, not trying to pass it off. And to be honest, give it my all.\"\n\nAt that time, he was not certain that he would compete in the upcoming relays. \"Yeah at the moment, I don't know. I'm still more on the side of letting Team USA do their thing,\" he told Johnson. \"They've proven with great certainty that they can handle it without me.\"\n\nLyles later decided that he was not going to compete anymore at the Paris Olympics. Due to the COVID diagnosis, Lyles will \"miss out on the rest of the Games,\" NBC News reported, adding that he was supposed to compete on relay teams, although his individual competitions are over already.\n\nLyles wrote a message to fans on his Instagram page on August 9.\n\n\"First I want to thank God for getting me through this entire Olympics! Second I want to congratulate @tebogo_letsile_ , @kenny_bednarek and everyone else on an amazing Olympic 200m final,\" he wrote. \"Finally I want to thank everyone for the supportive messages. I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics. It is not the Olympic I dreamed of but it has left me with so much Joy in my heart. I hope everyone enjoyed the show. Whether you were rooting for me or against me, you have to admit you watched, didn't you? \ud83d\ude09 See you next time.\"\n\nAccording to NBC News, Lyles didn't tell his competitors that he had COVID to keep his \"edge.\"\n\n\"We were trying to keep this as close to the chest as possible,\" Lyles told reporters, according to NBC. \"You never want to tell your competitors you're sick; why would you give them an edge over you?\" He said he quarantined while at the hotel, NBC reported.\n\nHe explained why he needed a wheelchair, saying that he felt \"quite lightheaded after that race, and shortness of breath and chest pain was definitely active,\" he said. \"But after a while, I was able to catch my breath and get my wits about me.

Perhaps even 'reckless'. He hugged the Tobogo after the race.\"\n\nUnder the stricter rules of Tokyo 2020, Lyles would have been forced into isolation and unable to compete in the race. However there are no specific Covid protocols in Paris, which means it's down to individual athletes to determine whether or not they can compete.\n\nThe US team went on to add that their Olympic and Paralympic Committee had made sure to adhere to all guidelines.\n\n\"We swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritise his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nLyles had previously planned to compete in tonight's (9 August) 4x100m relay and tomorrow's (10 August) 4x400m, however the athlete has since revealed on Instagram that last night was the 'end of my 2024 Olympics'.\n\nCompeting in the race had clearly been difficult for Lyles, who revealed afterwards the he felt 'quite light-headed' after finishing.\n\n\"It definitely affected my performance. I've had to take a lot of breaks... I was coughing through the night,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm more proud of myself than anything, coming out here to get a bronze with Covid.\"", "source": {"uri": "ladbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LADbible"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Disabled", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/bltcd74acc1d0a99f3a/blt4002d97e0287700f/66b5c2f29763ef6691824803/why-noah-lyles-allowed-race-covid.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803203", "eventUri": "eng-9803203", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 431, "textEnd": 439}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 510, "textEnd": 518}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 2540, "textEnd": 2548}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 2579, "textEnd": 2588}], "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

He lay on his back on the purple track at Stade de France, after finishing third in a race he had dominated for the past three years, and struggled for breath.\n\nFour days after winning a gold medal in one of the most thrilling endings to an Olympic sprint, Lyles took the bronze in the 200 and considered it, he said afterward, a remarkable achievement. Lyles learned that he had tested positive for the coronavirus around 5 a.m. Tuesday, less than 36 hours after he won the 100 in a photo finish that was a stunning start to an Olympic campaign he hoped would position him as the next great American track-and-field star.\n\nBut on Tuesday, after waking up with chills, aches and a sore throat, symptoms he had experienced during previous exposures, Lyles left the athletes village to quarantine in a nearby hotel. He said he was taking the antiviral treatment Paxlovid, and that he had not once considered dropping out or revealing his condition in advance of the 200 final. Athletes are not required to test or to report COVID-19 cases.\n\n\"We didn't want everybody to go into a panic, we wanted them to be able to compete,\" Lyles, wearing an N-95 mask, told reporters about 45 minutes after finishing in 19.70 seconds, behind Letsile Tebogo of Botswana (19.46), who won his country's first Olympic gold medal in its history, and American Kenneth Bednarek (19.62). Lyles added: \"And you never want to tell your competitors you're sick. Why would you give them an edge?\"\n\nThe Paris Olympics are the first to be held without the pandemic-era bubbles of the Tokyo Games in 2021 and the Beijing Games in 2022. In Tokyo, athletes were tested every four days. In Beijing, they were tested daily. When athletes tested positive, they were placed in quarantine. Most were forced to withdraw from the Games entirely.\n\nNational governing bodies have been tasked with creating their own COVID protocols. Few have specific policies, and many have resorted to something that resembles common sense. A positive test has not stopped athletes from competing.\n\nZac Stubblety-Cook, an Australian swimmer, had COVID when he won silver in the 200 backstroke. British swimmer Adam Peaty learned he had COVID a day after winning silver in the 100 breaststroke. Lani Pallister, another Australian swimmer, tested positive for COVID and decided to race two days later as part of the 4\u00d7200 relay team, which won gold.\n\nFor Lyles, who also has asthma, the first clue that he was not at full strength emerged Wednesday, when Tebogo raced past him in a semifinal heat; Lyles had won the past two world titles in the 200 -- and had not lost in the event since 2021 -- and so it seemed it was likely that he was lagging on purpose, conserving energy before Thursday's final and the upcoming 4\u00d7100 relays.\n\nWhen Lyles was introduced Thursday night, he darted out of the tunnel, spinning and shouting and pointing to the crowd. The crowd chanted \"USA! USA!\" until they were shushed over the arena loudspeakers.\n\nAt the gun, Lyles got off the blocks slower than the seven other finalists. But unlike Sunday, when he trailed for the first 90 meters before edging Kishane Thompson of Jamaica at the end, Lyles lacked endurance and speed, particularly around the bend.\n\nAfterward, Lyles sat near the track, breathing heavily. He got up slowly and called for water, after which medical officials led him to a seat and spoke to him.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete,\" USA Track and Field, the sport's national governing body, said in a statement Thursday night. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nLyles entered these Olympics eager to reassert his primacy after foundering at the Tokyo Games, where he finished with a bronze medal in the 200 and opened up about his struggles with his mental health. He called his medal \"boring\" as he spoke through tears to reporters, the only people who were in the stadium.\n\nLyles, 27, thinks of racing as performance art. He loves to race and win, but he loves to race and win in front of a full stadium even more -- the bigger and louder and feistier the crowd, the better.\n\nHe has ripped his speedsuit in triumph after winning world championships, presented anime cards to the camera before and after races, and has become a ubiquitous figure on his Peacock series, YouTube channel and the Netflix docuseries \"Sprint.\"\n\nAt the 2023 world championships in Budapest, Hungary, he turned in the performance he had long said he was capable of, winning the 100, 200 and the 4\u00d7100 relay. He had been eager to go for that trifecta in Paris, too, and perhaps add a gold medal in the 4\u00d7400 to it.\n\nInstead, the rest of Lyles' program is in doubt. He did not win the sprint double -- as Usain Bolt, Carl Lewis and Jesse Owens did -- and it wasn't clear Thursday whether he would run in any relays.", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com",

His usual commanding performance was visibly affected.\n\nTwo days before the race, Lyles tested positive for COVID-19. With the nod from USA Track and Field officials, who followed protocol, Lyles decided to compete despite the diagnosis. The American, donning a mask, pushed through the competition but couldn't match his usual speed.\n\nAfter the race, Lyles collapsed and required medical attention, a stark contrast to his typically vibrant demeanor.

This unexpected turn of events has brought his participation in Paris 2024 to an end.\n\nLyles, 27, had hoped to achieve the coveted double in the 100 and 200 metres, but his dreams were dashed when, after the race on Thursday, 8 August, he was wheeled off the track. The race was won by Botswana's Letsile Tebogo, while Lyles, despite the adversity, managed to secure the bronze medal.\n\nIn an emotional Instagram message, Lyles announced, \"I think this will be the end of my 2024 Olympic Games. It's not the Games I dreamed of, but it has left me with a lot of joy in my heart.\" This outcome means the runner will not be part of the American team competing in the 4x100 metre relay final, where they were favourites to contend for gold.\n\nLyles, who has previously dealt with asthma, was seen wearing a surgical mask shortly before the 200-metre final, which raised concerns about his health. However, when he was introduced to the public, he showed no signs of discomfort, entering the track with energy and enthusiasm, gesturing to encourage the crowd.\n\nIn an interview with NBC, Lyles described how he began to feel unwell. \"I woke up early, around 05:00 CEST on Tuesday, and I felt really terrible. I knew it wasn't just the usual soreness after the 100 metres. We woke the doctors, did tests, and unfortunately, it came back positive for Covid.\"\n\nThe runner acknowledged that his illness affected his performance in the race but expressed pride in winning a medal despite the circumstances. \"I'm very proud of myself for winning bronze with Covid,\" he stated. \"We tried to keep this as close to the chest. Only people who knew were the medical staff, my coach, and my family. We didn't want everybody to go into a panic. We wanted them to be able to compete. And you don't really want to tell your competitors you're sick. Why would you give them an edge over you?\"\n\nUSA Track and Field issued a statement following Lyles' revelation, stating that \"team officials took all necessary measures to prioritise his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of other competitors\" after the athlete's positive test. \"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of the athletes of Team USA while respecting their right to compete,\" the statement read. \"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nThe organisation also highlighted its strict adherence to guidelines for respiratory illnesses in order to prevent the spread of the virus among team members.

The account posted a few pictures of Team USA's win and joked about them securing a spot in the gold medal game, and therefore either a gold or silver medal, that they do not play for bronze medals at the Olympics.\n\n\"We don't play for Bronze.\"\n\nThis post caught the eye of many fans, as it was just a few hours after Noah Lyles secured the bronze medal in the 200-meter race at the Olympics. Lyles, who later revealed he ran the race while suffering from COVID-19, has been a polarizing figure among basketball circles since last year.\n\nNoah Lyles took a shot at the NBA last year for calling their winners world champions, claiming that a winner of a national league cannot be considered world champions. These comments drew criticism from several players, including Kevin Durant and Devin Booker.\n\nThis debate got heated further after Lyles secured the gold medal in the 100-meter race for Team USA. Booker responded to Noah Lyles winning gold by saying that it is harder for a team to win the NBA championship than it is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.\n\nObviously, it is not a fair comparison, as the Olympics is a much smaller, round-robin tournament played out over a few weeks. Whereas the NBA season is more of a league format that forces teams to play for months before the playoffs even begin. But clearly, there is a lot animosity toward Lyles for his comments.\n\nWas USA Basketball's Comments In Poor Taste?\n\nObviously, it should be noted that there is no confirmation about the shot being taken at Noah Lyles. But it is too convenient in its timing for it to be considered a pure coincidence. Furthermore, NBA players had been in attendance to see Lyles win gold, with Joel Embiid even walking out as soon as Lyles crossed the finish line.\n\nNoah Lyles winning a bronze medal was disappointing for American supporters but can be understood when it was revealed that he caught COVID-19 two days before the race, and that affected his performance.\n\nFurthermore, for the social media handle of an American team to seemingly take a shot at another American athlete during the Olympics, when they should be presenting a united front at the pinnacle of world sports.\n\nDespite this, Team USA could be motivated by Noah Lyles' comments, and his performance in the 200-meter race, to win the gold medal to prove a point to him. But it will not be easy, as they must overcome the host nation France, led by Victor Wembanyama to secure the gold.\n\nWith their performance against Serbia coming under fire, Team USA will have to lock in and focus ahead of their game on Saturday.

Instead of Lyles reeling in the runner two lanes to his right, Letsile Tebogo of Botswana, Tebogo pulled farther way. The American favorite, who had gone three years without losing in the 200, labored into the finish and collapsed onto the track after ending up in third.\n\nThe insidious specter of COVID, the killer virus that upended the globe four years ago and made the last Olympics part of its collateral damage, struck at the Paris Games, too.\n\nIn a bracing reminder that the virus is still very much a factor, even if its deadly fingerprint has been blunted, the world's marquee sprinter, racing on the world's biggest sports stage, revealed he had tested positive two days before his shocking, but now not-inexplicable, bronze-medal finish in the 200.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" Lyles said, wearing a mask, as he spoke to reporters, whose mere congregation in a jam-packed scrum underneath the stadium was unthinkable three years ago at the delayed Tokyo Games. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nWith the blessing of officials at USA Track and Field and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, who said they followed protocol, Lyles did run.\n\nHe finished in 19.70. That was .39 off his personal-best, and .24 behind the 21-year-old Tebogo. Lyles' U.S. teammate Kenny Bednarek finished second, marking the second straight Olympics in which he and Lyles finished 2-3.\n\n\"When I saw Kenny fade, I knew Noah was far, far, far away behind us,\" Tebogo said. \"So that means I'm the Olympic champion.\"", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@newindianexpress.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Track_&_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Track & Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/newindianexpress%2F2024-08-09%2F6paazair%2FNoah%20Lyles.webp?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803203", "eventUri": "eng-9803203", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Usually someone who gets better as the race goes on, he turned third and stayed there, rocking and rolling all over the place in the final 20 metres.\n\nBut few beyond medical personnel and Lyles's mother knew anything about his testing positive for Covid early on Tuesday morning. Not even his USA team-mates, two of whom he was running against, were made aware.\n\n\"We were trying to keep this as close to the chest as possible,\" Lyles said afterwards, through a black mask to prevent spreading the disease that he had also worn in the pre-race call room, and before Wednesday's semi-finals.\n\n\"You never want to tell your competitors you're sick; why would you give them an edge over you?\n\n\"I'd definitely say it's taken its toll, for sure. But I've never been more proud of myself for being able to come out here and get a bronze medal.\"\n\nThere are no specific rules at Paris 2024 regarding protocols for athletes who tested positive. Last week, British swimming superstar Adam Peaty tested positive and was separated from the rest of the team, but swam in the relay six days later.\n\nThe United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) took their own measures to ensure the spread of the illness was limited.\n\n\"The USOPC and USATF [USA Track and Field] swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritise his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors,\" a USATF spokesperson said.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nLyles said he never considered not running, even though he is asthmatic, severely enough that he has been hospitalised several times with attacks. After the race, he was suffering from lightheadedness, shortness of breath and chest pain after the race, and was taken off the track in a wheelchair.\n\n\"I've been in worse situations and I've run with worse conditions,\" Lyles added.\n\n\"We were going to try and quarantine as much has possible, stay away, not try to pass it on, and give it my all.\n\n\"If I wasn't to make it, and someone would have taken my spot, that would have been my sign that I didn't deserve to be in the final.\"\n\nHe did deserve to be in the final. He was, and still is, the reigning world 100m and 200m champion and was hoping to become the first American since Carl Lewis, watching from the stands, to win both sprint events at the same Games.\n\nInstead, Letsile Tebogo, 21, claimed Botswana's first ever Olympic gold medal in 19.46 seconds, making him the fifth fastest man in history over the distance.\n\nBut it was Lyles who stole the headlines from start to finish. He exploded out onto the track before the race had even started as the last man introduced to the crowd. He leaped over an advertising hoarding and ran around in front of his competitors acknowledging the crowd. He smacked his lane marker hard enough that the number fell off, earning him a warning from the referees, but otherwise it seemed he was his usually confident self.\n\nHis rivals, including team-mate Kenny Bednarek, were unfazed by Lyles's antics.\n\n\"He's a showman so he's always going to do that,\" said Bednarek, more than happy for him to \"hype up\" the race.\n\nThe silver medal that will soon be hung around his neck probably helped Bednarek's devil-may-care attitude, shrugging off questions about whether Lyles should have been allowed to run, or whether he cared that the Covid-positive sprinter had hugged him after the race.\n\n\"I don't care [if he had Covid],\" said Bednarek.\n\n\"If I get sick or whatever, I'm fine. If it's a cold or... I don't view those things as a big deal.\"\n\nHis form suggests Bednarek will run the 4x100m final on Friday night relay no matter what. Certainly, if the USA want to pick their strongest team, both men will figure, having both run the 100m and 200m finals.\n\nBut Lyles is unsure about stepping up, unusually so.\n\n\"At the moment I don't know,\" Lyles added.\n\n\"I'm feeling more on the side of letting Team USA do their thing. They've proven with great certainty that they can handle it without me.\"\n\nBut he also said: \"This is by far the best day I felt out of the last three days. I still wouldn't say I'm 100 per cent but I would definitely say I'm closer to 90 to 95 per cent.\"\n\nLyles has the luxury of medals already in the bank, in Paris and beyond. That is not to say he is not hungry for success, but he already has three Olympic medals in the bag and completed the sprint triple (100m, 200m, 4x100m) at the World Championships last year in Budapest. This will not, at the age of 27, be his last chance to rack up Olympic medals, you would expect.\n\nBut he will also not be forced into a decision by the rules. Covid is now part of the plethora of illnesses that athletes try to avoid at major competitions, which are a notorious breeding ground for flues and common colds that can hamstring a gold medal bid in just a few days.\n\nLyles should just be glad he didn't catch it three years ago, when it would have sent him into isolation and ultimately home.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Seven years later, he qualified for his first Olympic games in Tokyo. He took home the bronze medal for the 200-meter division.\n\nGoing into the 2024 Paris Olympics, Lyles revealed it was his goal to win four gold medals. However, he ended up winning gold in the 100-meter race and bronze in the 200-meter.\n\nHe's Neck and Neck With Usain Bolt\n\nSince Bolt's retirement in 2017, Lyles has been deemed the current \"fastest man in the world.\" While Bolt holds the record for the fastest time at the World Championship with 19.19 seconds, Lyles earned the second-best time in history with 19.31 seconds.\n\n\"Noah Lyles is a great athlete,\" Bolt said in an interview for the Netflix docuseries Sprint. \"He is full of energy. He has the crowd ... Mentally he is very strong. He believes in himself. But if he breaks the world record, I am not gonna be happy.\"\n\nHe's Candid About His Mental Health\n\nLyles revealed that he struggles with ADD, depression and anxiety. In 2020, he shared via social media that he was taking antidepressants.\n\n\"Recently I decided to get on antidepressant medication. That was one of the best decisions I have made in a while,\" he wrote via X. \"Since then I have been able to think without the dark undertone in mind of nothing matters. Thank you God for mental Health .\"\n\nLyles went off the medication ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, because he thought they were affecting his energy levels. Despite going off the prescription, he doesn't regret being candid about his struggle.\n\n\"It was strictly for the idea that I had taken something, and it made me feel better. And I knew there was a lot of people like me who were too scared to say something or even start that journey,\" he told TIME in August 2021. \"And I wanted them to know that if you see me in a big light, I want you to know that it's OK to not feel good. And you can go out and talk to somebody professionally, or even get on medication. Because this is a serious issue. You don't want to wake up one day and just think, I don't want to be here anymore.\"\n\nHe's a Big Fan of Nail Art\n\nLyles expresses his personality by rocking nail polish. He's donned colorful nails for track meets and other events. For the 2024 Paris games, Lyles went with a Patriotic theme and donned a red, white and blue design. At one point, he had the word \"icon\" painted across his fingers.\n\nWhile some find Lyles' style to be unique, more traditional fans have questioned the look. Lyles, for his part, doesn't care what the haters think about his nails.\n\n\"I'm a person who knows that a lot of people have different opinions and they have them for different reasons,\" Lyles exclusively told Us Weekly in July 2024. \"To be honest, I'm so confident in myself that it doesn't really matter. I think it's funny at times.\"\n\nHe's Dating Fellow Olympian Junelle Bromfield\n\nLyles and the Jamaican runner first connected on social media in 2017 but didn't start dating until five years later.\n\n\"My girlfriend's on [a] team as well, so we are training together and we're competing most of the same day,\" Lyles exclusively told Us of him and Bromfield in July 2024. \"We have that mental space to be able to share with each other and continuously feed to each other.\"", "source": {"uri": "fresnobee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Fresno Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri":

She's watching up there, and she's really, really happy.\"\n\nHaving ended Lyles' 26-race winning streak over the distance in the semi-finals, Tebogo announced himself on the global stage as he repeated that victory over the man who has long been tipped as Bolt's heir apparent.\n\nTebogo finishes in emotional triumph\n\nTebogo entered the home straight with an advantage and, as his rivals threatened to pull alongside, he surged away in the closing stages to clinch an emotional - and hugely significant - triumph.\n\nLyles, the fastest man over 200m this year before this race and a three-time reigning world champion over the distance, produced his usual theatrics before the serious business began.\n\nBut this performance in his favoured event was not at his usual world-beating standard and it soon became apparent why as news broke of the American's illness.\n\nBolt, the fastest man in history and winner of eight Olympic gold medals, completed the sprint double at three successive Games in Beijing, London and Rio - and he remains the only man to ever enjoy such a dominant streak.\n\nLyles had targeted a remarkable four golds in Paris, including both the 4x100m and 4x400m relays, but it remains to be seen whether he will be fit to contest those finals.", "source": {"uri": "capitalfm.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "Capital FM Kenya"}, "authors": [{"uri": "timothy_olobulu@capitalfm.co.ke", "name": "Timothy Olobulu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "alex_isaboke@capitalfm.co.ke", "name": "Alex Isaboke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2022 World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relay race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/sports/files/2024/08/Letsile-Tebogo-Oly-1024x576.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803203", "eventUri": "eng-9803203", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 15, "textEnd": 20}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: James Lang-USA TODAY Sports\n\n\"First I want to thank God for getting me through this entire Olympics!\"\n\nAmerican sprinter Noah Lyles has officially concluded his 2024 Paris Olympics journey, marking the end with a poignant message to his fans and followers.\n\nAfter winning the bronze medal in the 200-meter finals with a time of 19.70 seconds, the 27-year-old won't be a part of the 4\u00d7100-meter or the 4\u00d7400-meter relay team because he tested positive for COVID.\n\nIn a heartfelt Instagram post, the track star reflected on his Olympic experience, expressing gratitude and a sense of fulfillment even as he acknowledged that the outcome wasn't quite what he had envisioned.\n\n\" Finally I want to thank everyone for the supportive messages. I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics. It is not the Olympic I dreamed of but it has left me with so much Joy in my heart.\"\n\nThe athlete congratulated his fellow Team USA sprinter Kenny Bednarek and Botswanan athlete Letsile Tebogo on their silver and gold medal triumphs, respectively.\n\nThe post also included two images, the first of which showed Lyles crouching on the ground following the 200-meter finals. In the following scene, the American athlete embraced his Botswanan rival, displaying an impressive level of sportsmanship in the prestigious tournament.\n\nLyles undoubtedly had much more ambitious objectives for the Paris Olympics, but he was delighted with his accomplishments at the pinnacle of track and field.\n\n\"Hope everyone enjoyed the show. Whether you were rooting for me or against me, you have to admit you watched, didn't you? See you next time.\"\n\nLyles has been putting on a show every time he raced this season. This time, at the Paris Olympics, the six-time world champion showed that he could overcome any adversity through his rigorous training. In the 100m final, Lyles' outstanding performance proved to be his greatest achievement yet.\n\nKishane Thompson of Jamaica was the favorite entering the 100m final race, and he led from the start. However, in the final 50 meters, the Lyles charged from behind. Despite a poor start, Lyles finally overtook Thompson by 0.005 seconds to win his first Olympic gold medal.\n\nThis accomplishment was a complete thrill for American supporters, as it marked the first time in 20 years that a Team USA athlete had taken the gold back home since Justin Gatlin's victory.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rahul_goutam_hoom@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Rahul Goutam Hoom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/08/421c939a-noah-lyles-4.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803203", "eventUri": "eng-9803203", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

I hope everyone enjoyed the show.\"\n\nAfter crossing the finish line Thursday behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo and Team USA's Kenneth Bednarek, Lyles immediately laid down on the track. The 27-year-old athlete, who remained fully conscious, had to be helped off the track in a wheelchair by medical personnel, and was taken to a medical holding area.\n\nWearing a black medical mask, he told Olympic broadcaster NBC News that he was \"quite lightheaded after that race, and shortness of breath and chest pains were definitely active.\n\n\"But after a while underneath [the stands], I was able to catch my breath and get my wits about me. So I'm feeling a lot better now.\"\n\nLyles told reporters that he first tested positive after waking up \"feeling horrible\" around 5 a.m. on Tuesday. \"I knew it was more than just being sore from the [100-meter race],\" he said. \"I woke up the doctors and we tested, and unfortunately, it came out that I was positive for COVID.\"\n\nThe runner moved out of Paris' Athletes Village and into a hotel to isolate, taking \"as much medication as we legally could,\" including Paxlovid, under observation by USA Track & Field's medical team.\n\nStill, there was no question that Lyles would compete in the 200-meter, his signature event. On Wednesday, still feeling the effects of the virus, he finished second in his semi-final heat with a time of 20.08. His final time was 19.70, as compared to Tebogo's 19.46 and Bednarek's 19.62.\n\n\"I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go,\" he said. \"I didn't have any time to save energy, so that was kind of the strategy for today,\" he added. \"This is by far the best day I felt out of the last three days. I still wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I would definitely say I'm closer to like, 90 to 95 percent.\"\n\nThe northern Virginia native did not break any Olympics protocols by competing in the race. While the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics and 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics instituted strict rules regarding testing and masking, the 2024 Paris Games allow COVID-positive athletes to compete at their discretion. At least 19 athletes have tested positive over the past two weeks, according to Scientific American.\n\nUSA Track & Field said it supported Lyles' decision to continue competing. After his positive COVID test, a spokesperson said that officials \"swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritize his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete.

That was the strategy.\n\n\"It definitely affected my performance. I am more proud of myself than anything.

That meant the American, who became the 100m champion by just five-thousandths of a second on Sunday, was unable to attend the post-race press conference.\n\nIt was during the chat with journalists when Tebogo - the youngest men's 200m gold medalist since 1956 - claimed that he couldn't be the 'face of athletics' because of Lyles' more dominant personality. \"I think, for me, I can't be the face of athletics because I'm not an arrogant and loud person like Noah,\" Tebogo said. \"So, I believe Noah is the face of athletics.\"\n\nThe 21-year-old's inflammatory comments came while Lyles was recovering after the race, having been spotted in a wheelchair at the Stade de France. Lyles did, however, post on social media just before 10pm local time to congratulate Tebogo.\n\n\"LETSILE TEBOGO congratulations!\" the Florida-born sprinter wrote. \"I know you have had a very rough year off the track and despite that you overcame it all!\"\n\nTebogo lost his mother in May and dedicated Thursday's outstanding win, achieved in 19.46 seconds, to her. \"It really means a lot to my late mum because she always dreamt of making it here,\" he said.\n\n\"I think my little sister is in the stands. I don't know where she's sitting, but I believe she's happy, she's representing her while she's here. So it means a lot for everybody - the country, the continent, and my family at large.\"\n\nLyles certainly has one of the biggest and most inspirational personalities among the world's best sprinters, posting on social media after his 100m win: \"I have Asthma, allergies, dyslexia, ADD, anxiety, and Depression. But I will tell you that what you have does not define what you can become. Why Not You!\"\n\nYour turn! Did Letsile Tebogo go too far with his criticism of Noah Lyles? Let us know in the comments section\n\nLyles could've competed in the men's 4x100m relay on Friday but he appears to have opted out due to Covid. \"First I want to thank God for getting me through this entire Olympics! Second I want to congratulate Letsile Tebogo and [USA team-mate and 200m silver medalist] Kenny Bednarek and everyone else on an amazing Olympic 200m final,\" the 27-year-old wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"Finally I want to thank everyone for the supportive messages. I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics. It is not the Olympics I dreamed of but it has left me with so much Joy in my heart.\n\n\"I hope everyone enjoyed the show.

He received medical treatment after crossing the line and after the race US officials said he had tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday, two days after he won the 100m gold.\n\n\"In response to the test, the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee and USA Track & Field (USATF) swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritise his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors,\" USATF said in a statement.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nAdding to the chaos, a yellow card appeared against Lyle's name in the official results to mark a misconduct violation for damaging his lane box before the race start.\n\nThe Lyles show might still hog much of the limelight, but on the track it was Tebogo and Africa's night. It is common to see a clutch of Africans in major middle and long-distance races, but this was the first time in Olympic history that four appeared in a sprint final.\n\nAlthough three filled the last three positions, Tebogo's place on top of the podium in an African record was a huge leap forward.\n\n\"I'm the Olympic champion, it's something I have never seen in my life or dreamt of - it is an amazing moment,\" the 21-year-old told reporters.\n\n\"I just came here with the little that I had in me to push through because yesterday we made it to the final, my coach told me 'now it's your race'.\n\n\"I knew Kenny was going to run away so made sure just to close him down, I have that top-end speed that will allow me to finish the race without getting tired, so that's what I did, and when I saw Kenny fade I knew Noah was far, far away behind us so that means I'm the Olympic champion.\n\n\"It means a lot for everybody, the country, the continent and my family.\"\n\nBednarek, the man in the middle again, ran a fantastic bend in lane eight and finished strongly, but not just quite fast enough.\n\n\"I don't think I put my best race down, it was really tight at the end,\" he said.\n\n\"This year I'm finally healthy.

Despite coming up short, Lyles, 27, has been hailed as the new face of athletics due to his loud, outlandish personality.\n\nAhead of both the 100m and 200m finals, his entrance antics resembled that of a WWE wrestler. On both occasions the Florida-born sprinter galloped out onto the track, leapt into the air and gesticulated wildly at the crowd, something which, evidently, rubbed his rivals up the wrong way.\n\nAfter becoming the first Botswanan athlete ever to win Olympic gold on Thursday, Tebogo took a cheeky swipe at Lyles. The 21-year-old admitted his American opponent was the pin-up of the sport, but only because he was \"loud\" and \"arrogant\".\n\nWhen asked if he aspired to become the \"next Usain Bolt\", he told reporters: \"For me, I can't be the face of athletics because I'm not an arrogant or a loud person like Noah. So I believe Noah is the face of athletics.\"\n\nAfter the race, Lyles demonstrated a great deal of class by congratulating Tebogo on his victory. He wrote on social media: \"LETSILE TEBOGO congratulations [champagne emoji]. Ik [I know] you have had a very rough year off the track and despite that you overcame it all,\" referencing the death of Tebogo's mother back in May.\n\nLyles was heavy favourite heading into the 200m final, having not lost in the event for three years. But his performance may have been hampered due to the fact he tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday, and he was spotted in a wheelchair after the race.\n\nHis decision to still take part in the race was criticised by the likes of BBC presenters Clare Balding and Michael Johnson, who accused Lyles of putting other athletes at risk of infection. But the 100m champion hit back by suggesting that entertaining the masses was more important.\n\n\"I hope everyone enjoyed the show,\" he wrote on Instagram. \"Whether you were rooting for me or against me, you have to admit you watched, didn't you?\"\n\nHe also revealed that, due to his illness, his Olympics was over, ending his dream of winning medals in the 100m, 200m, 4x100m relay and the 4x400m relay. \"I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics,\" he added. \"It is not the Olympics I dreamed of but it has left me with so much joy in my heart.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The United States are going for gold in the 4x100m relay, which Lyles sat out as his teammates cruised to victory in the semi final.

The 21-year-old sprinter's stellar performance overshadowed the American challenge, with Kenny Bednarek claiming a consecutive silver in 19.62, closely followed by Noah Lyles, the 100m gold medalist, who secured the bronze with a time of 19.70.\n\nBotswana's Olympic journey saw its maiden medal at the 2012 London Olympics when Nijel Amos clinched silver in the 800m event. Additionally, the men's 4x400m relay team added a bronze to the collection at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nTebogo's athletic prowess was evident from a young age, holding the U20 world record in the 100m. His breakthrough on the global stage occurred at the 2023 World Championships in Budapest, where he claimed silver in the 100m and bronze in the 200m. Notably, his gold-medal-winning time of 19.46 marked a new personal best, surpassing his previous record set at the 2023 London Diamond League.\n\nBednarek, a consistent performer, secured silver in the 200m at the 2022 World Championships in Eugene and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Despite his commendable efforts, his time of 19.62 in Paris fell short of his personal best of 19.59 achieved at the 2024 U.S. Olympic Trials. Determined to excel, Bednarek expressed his ambition to secure victory in future competitions following his second-place finish behind Lyles at the Trials.\n\nLyles, aiming for his second gold medal of the 2024 Olympics in pursuit of his declared goal of four golds during the Games, faced an unexpected hurdle. Testing positive for COVID mere days before the men's 200 final, Lyles battled through illness to compete, driven by his unwavering determination.\n\nThe repercussions of his illness were palpable during the final race, with Lyles acknowledging its impact on his performance. Post-race, he experienced symptoms of lightheadedness, shortness of breath, and chest pain, prompting medical attention and his subsequent removal from the track in a wheelchair.\n\nReflecting on the event, Lyles highlighted the influence of his illness on his race performance, emphasising its disruptive effect.

Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nShots were fired not just before the Men's 200m sprint began but also after it, with a verbal tiff among the athletes.\n\nThe race witnessed Botswana's Letsile Tebogo ace through the group to bag the gold, closely followed by USA's Kenny Bednarek swooping in on the silver. What shocked fans was his teammate, Noah Lyles, lagging, managing the third place on the podium.\n\nThis caused some commotion among the crowd, wondering what caused Lyles to slow down despite being in high spirits a few days ago.\n\nIt turns out that doctors had diagnosed him with COVID-19 hours before the race, leading him to fight through his health to get a place on the podium.\n\nPost-victory, Tebogo, and Bednarek were present at a press conference that Lyles skipped due to his state of health. Amidst a couple of questions surrounding the race and their prep, reporters asked Tebogo if he felt he was the face of athletics now that he had won gold.\n\nFor the longest time, track and field was a distinct sport due to the participation of Usain Bolt, along with his accolades. The Jamaican's records across various sprinting competitions have made him an iconic figure across the world.\n\nNow that he isn't in the competitive scene anymore, this has probably prompted a movement to look for another face to represent the track.\n\nHowever, the question triggered an unexpected reply from the Botswana-native. Instead of keeping things subtle, Tebogo fired shots at his rival, Lyles, by explaining why he didn't see himself as the face of the sport.\n\n\"I can't be the face of athletics because I'm not an arrogant or a loud person like Noah.\"\n\nTrue to his words, he felt Lyles was better as the face of the sport rather than him. The reply caused quite some ruckus in the comments, some even laughing about how the culture of banter between athletes has transcended beyond a sport like UFC to the track.\n\nHowever, many seemed to agree that Tebogo didn't necessarily mean for his statement to sound crass. Instead, his message about Lyles being a bolder personality got lost in translation.\n\nYet, the statement might have created quite a stir in the track and field world after the rivals battled it out on the field.

Ahead of the 100m and 200m finals, his flamboyant entrances bore a striking resemblance to those of a WWE star, complete with running onto the track, jumping in the air, and gesturing wildly at the crowd.\n\nREAD MORE: Bodies left strewn on Olympic track as Team GB star confronts rival and BBC man stunned\n\nREAD MORE: People are only just realising what the Olympic rings mean\n\nHis antics have clearly rubbed one or two of his rivals up the wrong way, including Tebogo, who labelled Lyles \"arrogant\" after pipping him in the 200m event.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the race, the 21-year-old was asked if he'd like to emulate Olympic legend Usain Bolt.

However, the 100m champion responded defiantly about his performance's significance.\n\nTaking to Instagram, Lyles said: \"I hope everyone enjoyed the show. Whether you were rooting for me or against me, you have to admit you watched, didn't you?\"\n\nFurthermore, with the illness taking its toll, he announced the premature end of his Olympic journey, accepting the loss of his aspirations for multiple medals with grace and positivity: \"I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics,\" he declared. \"It is not the Olympics I dreamed of but it has left me with so much joy in my heart.\"", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_symbols", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic symbols"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Balding", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clare Balding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29706969.ece/alternates/s1200/0_athletics-olympic-games-paris-2024-day-13.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803203", "eventUri": "eng-9803203", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Lyles, a world champion known for his speed and charisma, faced a barrage of criticism after a social media user made disparaging remarks that some argue violate the principles of the Olympic spirit.\n\nThe incident centers on a comment that dismissed Lyles' achievement, suggesting that his success was undeserved despite testing positive earlier in the week -- a reference many interpreted as a jab at his athletic integrity. The comment quickly became a flashpoint for debate, with defenders of the sprinter arguing that the criticism was baseless and rooted in misunderstanding or language barriers. At the same time, detractors doubled down, questioning Lyles' legitimacy as an Olympic medalist.\n\nLyles, who tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday but went on to secure a bronze medal on Thursday, has become a polarizing figure in this ongoing debate. His critics have seized on the timing of his positive test and subsequent medal win, insinuating his performance was tainted. However, his supporters have rallied around him, emphasizing his resilience and talent, arguing that his achievements should be celebrated, not questioned.\n\nThe broader controversy touches on deeper issues of fairness, sportsmanship, and the role of language in international competitions. Some have pointed out that the comments against Lyles not only undermine his accomplishments but also reflect a troubling disregard for the inclusivity and respect that the Olympics are supposed to embody. Others argue that the criticism of Lyles is symptomatic of a larger trend of hyper-scrutiny faced by athletes in the social media age, where every aspect of their performance is dissected and debated by a global audience.\n\nThe incident has also reignited discussions about the pressures on athletes to perform at the highest levels, especially under the extraordinary circumstances of a pandemic-impacted Olympic Games. For Lyles, who has been open about his mental health struggles, this criticism adds another layer of complexity to the challenges he faces as a top-tier competitor.\n\nAs the debate rages on, it serves as a reminder of the fine line between constructive criticism and harmful rhetoric. While sports have always been a realm of intense competition and strong opinions, the spirit of the Olympics has traditionally been one of unity, respect, and celebration of human achievement. The controversy surrounding Lyles highlights the tension between these ideals and the reality of modern sports discourse, where athletes are often subject to the harshest scrutiny.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee has yet to comment on the situation. Still, the incident has certainly sparked conversations about the need for more supportive environments for athletes, both online and off. As Lyles continues his athletic career, the controversy will likely follow him, serving as a stark example of the challenges athletes face in an era where social media can amplify praise and criticism to unprecedented levels.", "source": {"uri": "econotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EconoTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsmanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sportsmanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://f1.econotimes.com/2024/08/ax65hs014e_th_1024x0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803203", "eventUri": "eng-9803203", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

American Kenneth Bednarek grabbed silver with a time of 19.62 seconds, while Lyles secured bronze in 19.70 seconds. In a concerning turn of events, Lyles revealed post-race that he had tested positive for COVID-19 and had to be assisted off the track in a wheelchair.\n\nIn an emotional gesture, Tebogo dedicated his historic win, Botswana's first-ever Olympic gold, to his late mother, Elizabeth Seratiwa, who passed away last May. Displaying her initials on his fingernails and her birth date on his spikes, Tebogo expressed, 'I believe she could be one of the happiest people on the planet. Because she believed in me and I had so much doubt for myself,' according to Olympics.com.\n\nLater in the day, India's Neeraj Chopra fell just short of defending his Olympic title in men's javelin, earning a silver medal with a top throw of 89.45 meters. Despite a strong qualification performance and throwing 89.34 meters, Chopra had four foul throws in the final, which hampered his gold medal ambitions.\n\nNeeraj Chopra's achievement makes him the second Indian male athlete to win two Olympic medals in an individual event post-independence.

But the review's never not been enterprising. Amid all the Sturm and Drang of other sprinters, a star has been born. The men's 200m made its debut at the second Olympic Games in 1900. And at Olympics 33, rocket forward Letsile Tebogo, the first champion from Africa. He etched his legend in 19.46 seconds, the fifth fastest time in history. The women were allowed to participate in the 200m fun in 1948 in London. And only Christine Mboma from Namibia has got the closest to gold. She won silver in Tokyo in 2021.\n\nReally?\n\nNoah Lyles, the man with the third fastest time in the 200m - 19.31 - finished the 200m final in third place. Lyles, who claimed the 100m in Paris, had been vying to become the first American in 40 years to win the 100m and 200m in the same Olympics. But Letsile Tebogo stopped that idea. Lyles was off the pace in his semi-final and well behind in the final. Reasons?

In fact, he didn't even acknowledge them.\n\nThe reporter asked if he was looking forward to the rivalry with Canada in Paris, to which Lyles replied: \"Who?\"\n\nWhen the reporter repeated \"Canada\", Lyles against said: \"Who?\".\n\nLyles' teammates realised he was joking around and burst out laughing, but they certainly weren't laughing inside the Stade de France on Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, the USA did win gold in the women's 4x100m relay.", "source": {"uri": "sportbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.sportbible.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_De_Grasse", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre De Grasse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College rivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Relays", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Relays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blta90d05ad41a54a71/blt8b8047d1126ec5f9/66b6794e1fcf890144bb8655/453791792_477809881848301_9102582565093250585_n.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803203", "eventUri": "eng-9803203", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 460931294, "relevance": 2}

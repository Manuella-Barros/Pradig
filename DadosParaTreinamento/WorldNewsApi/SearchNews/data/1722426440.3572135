{"id": 243361142, "title": "The N-340 Route 66 - Costa Tropical Gazette News", "text": "The provincial representative for VOX obtained the backing of the other parties in the Provincial Council to turn the N-340 coastal road in to a Spanish Route 66. The idea is to convert this main road (which has been made into a secondary route in nature because of the A-7 autovia) into a tourist attraction, breathing life back into the bars, restaurants and gasolineras that withered on the vine when the autovia opened. To do this, they proposed registering the road in the Oficina Espa\u00f1ola de Patentes y Marcas (OEPM) as the \u201clongest road in Spain,\u201d which it is, as it connects the French border with the Portuguese border via the Mediterranean coast. Vox Provincial Spokesman, Gustavo de Castro, emphasised that they could manage to produce \u201ca tourisim product of such a scope that would replicate successful models such as Route 66 in the United States, where many businesses have sprung up along its way, including hotels, restaurants, car & motorbike rental firms.\u201d He pointed out that coastal towns like Castell de Ferro, La Mamola and Albu\u00f1ol \u201clife has practically ebbed away\u201dalong the old N-340. Editorial comment: the N-340 between Torrenueva Costa and Charcuna and then Calahonda to Castell de Ferro are a delight for a biker with cliff-top view and winding bends void of urban intrustion along the way. The same could be said from Castells de Ferro to La R\u00e1bita.

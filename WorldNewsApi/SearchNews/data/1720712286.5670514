He had earlier represented Ludhiana on a Congress ticket during the first and second terms of the Narendra Modi-led government.Meanwhile, AAP leader and Punjab Minister Harpal Singh Cheema, took a dig at the BJP and said that the party had made a \"mockery\" of the mandate of Ludhiana voters and asserted that a defeated candidate was being made a minister. \"If they had to make him happy, they would have made him contest the Rajya Sabha elections and sent him to the Centre,\" he said.Meanwhile, Narendra Modi is set to take oath as the Prime Minister for a record third term at the Rashtrapati Bhavan as the NDA secured a majority in the Lok Sabha elections, winning 293 seats.The BJP won 240 seats, 32 short of the majority mark, after the party enjoyed a full majority on its own in the previous two tenures.(with inputs from PTI)Published By: Prateek ChakrabortyPublished On: Jun 9, 2024ALSO READ | Five reasons behind BJP's dismal show in Punjab and HaryanaALSO READ | Punjab | Caught in a quagmireMust Watch", "summary": "<a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/video-bjp-leader-on-way-to-modis-home-stuck-in-traffic-he-gets-down-and-runs-2551010-2024-06-09\"> <img align=\"left\" hspace=\"2\" height=\"180\" width=\"305\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/ravneet-singh-bittu-091044864-16x9_0.png?VersionId=rBIFUSkwtY7.afjHWq81_5pn5DjrqZun\"> </a> Video: BJP leader on way to meet PM gets stuck in traffic, runs on road", "url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/video-bjp-leader-on-way-to-modis-home-stuck-in-traffic-he-gets-down-and-runs-2551010-2024-06-09", "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/ravneet-singh-bittu-091044864-16x9_0.png?VersionId=rBIFUSkwtY7.afjHWq81_5pn5DjrqZun?size=1280:720", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:26:13", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.081}

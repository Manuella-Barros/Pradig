He joined Camelon after three years as a senior at Coatbridge\u2019s Albion Rovers, now a Scottish Lowland Football League rival of Fairydean\u2019s following their relegation from Scottish League 2 in 2023. Dolan is manager Martin Scott\u2019s second pre-contract signing of the close season, following Arbroath midfielder Keaghan Jacobs agreeing a deal at the start of the month. \u201cWe would like to thank Kieran for all his hard work and effort, and we wish him all the best for next season and the future,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Mariners. Dolan has been given squad number 23 at Netherdale and Jacobs will wear the No 7 shirt as Rovers look to improve on their third-from-bottom finish in the fifth tier last campaign.

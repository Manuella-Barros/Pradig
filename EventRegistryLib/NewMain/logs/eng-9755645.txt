Youth in the region can be imparted training for capacity building and skilling. They can then go to the Southeast Asian nations as migrant workers. Experts are of the view that the ASEAN member states can also invest in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the Northeast such as manufacturing of bamboo-based products. It now remains to be seen how far Jaishankar can push forward this agenda during the deliberations with his counterparts from the ASEAN nations in Laos.\n\nNew Delhi: Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma's meeting with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar ahead of the latter's departure for Vientiane, Laos, for this year's Foreign Ministers' Meetings under the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) framework is yet another manifestation of the importance India's northeastern region lays to ties with Southeast Asian countries.\n\n\"Pleased to meet Chief Minister of Assam @himantabiswa in South Block today,\" Jaishankar posted on his X handle following the meeting on Tuesday. \"Discussed Act East and BIMSTEC policies and how Assam can contribute to our Neighborhood First approach.\"\n\nOn his part, Sarma said that during his meeting with Jaishankar, both of them deliberated upon a constructive role for Assam to strengthen Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Act East Policy. Writing on his own X handle, Sarma stated that the possibilities of \"encouraging foreign investors to be a part of the Assam growth story and firmly establishing our state as a preferred gateway to Southeast Asia\" formed part of the discussions.\n\nDuring the course of his visit, Jaishankar will participate in the Foreign Ministers' Meetings under the ASEAN framework in the format of ASEAN-India, East Asia Summit (EAS) and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).\n\n\"The visit underlines India's deep engagement with and the importance India attaches to the ASEAN-centred regional architecture, our strong commitment to ASEAN unity, ASEAN centrality, the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP) and taking forward the ASEAN-India Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,\" a statement issued by the External Affairs Ministry reads. \"It is of particular significance that this year marks a decade of India's Act East Policy which was announced by THE Prime Minister at the 9th East Asia Summit in 2014.\"\n\nWhat is the importance of the Northeast in terms of India-ASEAN relations?\n\nUnder the Act East Policy, the Northeast, which shares historical and traditional bonds with the ASEAN region, is seen as the springboard for India's increasing engagements with Southeast Asia. Both the Indian government and the ASEAN have the intent to explore opportunities in the Northeast to strengthen bilateral ties between New Delhi and the 10-nation bloc.\n\nThe Northeast is the region that is in the closest geographical proximity to the ASEAN countries. In fact, New Delhi formulated the Look East Policy in the early 1990s and the Act East Policy in 2014 precisely to leverage this geographical proximity.\n\nIn fact, in May this year, when the Fourth Joint Committee meeting for the review of the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) was held in Putrajaya, Malaysia, the focus was again back on the role India's northeastern region can play in this regard.\n\nThe AITIGA is a comprehensive trade agreement between the ASEAN and India, aimed at promoting bilateral trade and economic cooperation. Negotiations for the agreement began in 2003 and were concluded in 2009, with the agreement entering into force on January 1, 2010.\n\nOne of the central objectives of AITIGA is the reduction and eventual elimination of tariffs on goods traded between ASEAN member states and India. Under the agreement, both sides have committed to gradually reducing tariffs on a wide range of products over specified periods. These measures include simplifying customs procedures, enhancing transparency, and reducing non-tariff barriers to trade, thereby making it easier and more cost-effective for businesses to engage in cross-border trade.\n\nWhat are the challenges that the Northeast faces in playing a more pivotal role in India-ASEAN relations and trade?\n\nThe ASEAN is one of the major trade partners of India with a share of 11 per cent in India's global trade. However, the fact of the matter is that the Northeast's potential is yet to be exploited to boost bilateral economic and political ties between India and the ASEAN. For example, though India-ASEAN bilateral trade stood at $122.67 billion in 2023-24, the Northeast accounted for only a meagre five per cent of it. The rest of the trade originated from states in other parts of India.\n\nThough a number of diplomatic and business delegations from the ASEAN visited the Northeast since the turn of the century and in the 2000s primarily to explore business and investment opportunities in the region, challenges like governance, ease of doing business, connectivity and security are discouraging them from taking the process forward.\n\nIn terms of governance, the ASEAN has found that the northeastern states have poor institutional mechanism to handle issues such as corruption, efficiency, accountability and monitoring implementation of projects. Barring Assam's main city of Guwahati, other states of the region have not set up systems or created an environment that is conducive for ease of business. Making people engaging in malpractices accountable is a major challenge in the region. Here, the issue of infrastructure also comes into focus. The infrastructure in the region is very poor compared to other parts of India.\n\nOn the connectivity side, though the Northeast is in close proximity with Southeast Asia, land connectivity is yet to materialise because of the endless political turmoil in Myanmar. Any interaction that happens between Southeast Asia and northeastern India has to pass through Myanmar.\n\nThe 1,360-km-long India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway project connecting Moreh in Manipur and Mae Sot in Thailand has long been delayed due to the situation in Myanmar. Actual construction work on upgrading road segments began around 2012 in all three countries. However, due to political instability and civil unrest in Myanmar, 30 per cent of the work is yet to be completed.\n\nAs of now, trade between India and the ASEAN nations is mainly happening through maritime and aerial routes. But it is the land connectivity between the Northeast and Southeast Asia that the ASEAN countries are more interested in because then it will become a permanent feature.\n\nWhat is the potential of the Northeast in becoming a catalyst in boosting India-ASEAN ties?\n\nThe biggest potential of the Northeast is its natural resources. In terms of products, primary goods can be exported from the Northeast and not manufactured goods as industries are minimal in the region. According to experts, the ASEAN nations are interested in agro-based industries as the region is rich in organic fruits and vegetables. Processing of such agricultural products is of interest for them.\n\nAnother area sector is tourism. Northeast India and Southeast Asia share historical, cultural and religious (Buddhist) ties. The ASEAN countries can invest in the hospitality sector.\n\nHuman resources in the Northeast is an area that the ASEAN nations can benefit by investing in. Youth in the region can be imparted training for capacity building and skilling. They can then go to the Southeast Asian nations as migrant workers. Experts are of the view that the ASEAN member states can also invest in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the Northeast such as manufacturing of bamboo-based products.

The ASEAN+3 partnership has huge potential to facilitate the further growth of the East Asian region.\n\nRecent developments, especially the high-level China-Japan-ROK trilateral summit in May, point toward increasingly close cooperation between ASEAN and China, Japan and the ROK. The trilateral summit in Seoul reflected the willingness of the three major partners of ASEAN to deepen their ongoing cooperation and trade relations with the Southeast Asian bloc, with the leaders from China, Japan and the ROK expressing mutual support in priority areas such as trade, disaster relief and cultural exchanges.\n\nAlthough the Seoul summit focused on broad issues, achieving limited success in addressing specific challenges, for ASEAN, it unveiled the potential for progress while raising hopes of addressing future challenges.\n\nBeijing, Tokyo and Seoul are major trading partners of ASEAN and members of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which marked another significant step toward economic integration in the region.\n\nThe three economies have made massive investments in the region and view ASEAN as a key area for expanding their production networks, which can improve the connectivity among the regional trade and supply chains. With its geographical proximity, abundant resources expanding markets and vibrant economies, ASEAN has become an important trade and economic partner of the three countries. On the other hand, strengthening cooperation with ASEAN is essential for the three countries to achieve their economic and strategic goals within and beyond the region.\n\nThus, it seems to be a good sign that ASEAN and China, Japan and the ROK are trying to find new grounds for deepening collaboration to address challenges such as aging populations, climate change, health security, economic recovery and growth in the post-COVID-19 pandemic world.\n\nTo unleash the full potential of ASEAN+3 cooperation, emphasis should be placed on economic integration, modern infrastructure development and facilitation of trade through streamlined regulations. To be more specific, ASEAN+3 collaboration to maintain financial stability should be strengthened as stronger financial cooperation through initiatives such as the multilateralization of the Chiang Mai Initiative can create safety nets during economic crises.\n\nThe ASEAN+3 partnership also extends to non-economic areas, including people-to-people exchanges, especially student exchanges, disaster-risk reduction and strengthening regional security. These efforts are aimed at improving mutual understanding and fostering a more stable and peaceful East Asia. More importantly, increasing awareness about regional common challenges such as climate change, food security, energy security, and environmental protection requires joint platforms for problem-solving and efficient cooperation in the region.\n\nHowever, translating a grand vision and broad agreements into concrete actions remains challenging due to the need for strong political will, efficient governance mechanisms and effective monitoring to ensure commitments are fulfilled. In addition, limited public awareness and misunderstanding of ASEAN+3 cooperation may affect social support and discourage active participation from local citizens.\n\nDespite the promising trends of ASEAN+3 cooperation, there remain obstacles and challenges that must be overcome to realize the full potential of the ASEAN+3 partnership. The challenges include tensions over maritime claims of some ASEAN+3 countries in the South China Sea and political disagreements. These issues create differences and disputes and hinder cooperation, making policy decisions challenging. Therefore, addressing these sensitive issues through diplomacy based on mutual respect and resolving the disputes are crucial for maintaining peace.\n\nFurthermore, economic disparities between some ASEAN member states and the more advanced economies of China, Japan and the ROK need to be addressed as it could lead to unequal benefits and capacity gaps. Efforts to achieve inclusive development within the ASEAN+3 framework aim to address development gaps within the group, focusing on enhancing different countries' capabilities through targeted investments, technology transfer and institutional strengthening with clearer operational frameworks and improved communication channels.\n\nAdditionally, external influences and geopolitical issues have impacted the dynamics of ASEAN+3, making it difficult to pursue common interests in the region. Hence, it is necessary to strengthen regional economic and security cooperation through multilateral mechanisms and offset external influences in a way that prioritizes the needs and interests of the region.\n\nIn summary, the positive signs of closer ASEAN+3 cooperation indicate a promising future for the region, although intensified efforts are needed to promote inclusive development, build stronger institutional frameworks, streamline bureaucratic processes and foster effective communication channels, in order to overcome initial obstacles. By addressing these challenges and fostering a spirit of cooperation, ASEAN+3 can unleash its true potential, build a more thriving and integrated East Asia, and become a key player in the global economic and political arena.\n\nThe author is an associate professor at the Faculty of Economics, Thammasat University, Thailand.\n\nThe views don't necessarily reflect those of China Daily.",

The military leadership in Myanmar has so far ignored the plan and has raised questions about the bloc's efficiency and credibility to mediate for peace.\n\nBroader talks, including diplomats from elsewhere in the region including Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, are expected to focus on issues including the economy, security, climate and energy.\n\nRegional issues, including Cambodia's decision to build a canal off the Mekong River that Vietnam, which is downstream, worries could have ecological and security implications, as well as massive dam building projects in Laos further upstream could also feature in the meetings.\n\nIn Myanmar, the army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule, leading to increasing violence and a humanitarian crisis.\n\nIn an effort to put pressure on Myanmar, ASEAN has prohibited it from sending any political representatives to top-level meetings, and it has sent bureaucrats instead. Aung Kyaw Moe, the permanent secretary of Myanmar's Foreign Ministry, was expected to attend this week's meetings, which run through Saturday.\n\nMore than 5,400 people have been killed in the fighting in Myanmar and the military government has arrested more than 27,000 since the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. In addition, there are now more than 3 million displaced people in the country, with the numbers growing daily as fighting intensifies between the military and Myanmar's multiple ethnic militias as well as the so-called people's defense forces of military opponents.\n\nAs the needs of civilians grow, discussions on humanitarian assistance to Myanmar will also be a focus of the ASEAN talks, Bolbongse Vangphaen, head of the Thai Foreign Ministry's department for ASEAN, told reporters ahead of the meetings.\n\nThailand, which shares a long border with Myanmar, has already been heavily involved in providing humanitarian assistance, and Bolbongse said the country is ready to support the next phase of delivery being planned by the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management.\n\nHe did not say when or where the aid delivery would be.\n\nThailand initiated its first delivery of aid to Myanmar in March from the northern province of Tak. It was said to be distributed in Kayin state to approximately 20,000 out of millions of people displaced by fighting.\n\nLandlocked Laos is the bloc's poorest nation and one of its smallest, and many have expressed skepticism about how much it can accomplish while the crises mount. But it is also the first ASEAN chair that shares a border with Myanmar. Laos has already sent a special envoy to Myanmar for meetings with the head of the ruling military council and other top officials in an attempt to make progress on the peace plan.\n\nASEAN also has introduced a mechanism of trilateral informal consultation among its current, past, and future chairs, specifically for ensuring continuity in its response to the situation in Myanmar. The troika met for the first time on Wednesday, attended by Laos, Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nIndonesia Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said Wednesday after the meeting that he raised concerns about increasing numbers of cross-border crimes and refugees that resulted from a crisis in Myanmar. He said he urged ASEAN to \"promote trust and confidence building through a balanced and low-key approach\" to foster an inclusive dialogue among all relevant stakeholders in Myanmar.\n\n\"The worsening conditions in Myanmar have a direct impact on efforts to maintain peace and stability in the region,\" he said.\n\nDulyapak Preecharush, a professor of Southeast Asia Studies at Bangkok's Thammasat University, said ASEAN is not the only stakeholder when it comes to Myanmar, with China and India also major players -- and both attending the ASEAN meetings.\n\nProgress on Myanmar \"needs to start with countries that share borders with Myanmar, such as China, India and Thailand, to find a joint consensus to address the problems\" before expanding to other countries, he said.\n\nIn other issues, ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei are locked in maritime disputes with China over its claims of sovereignty over virtually all of the South China Sea, one of the world's most crucial waterways for shipping. Indonesia has also expressed concern about what it sees as Beijing's encroachment on its exclusive economic zone.\n\nAn estimated $5 trillion in international trade passes through the South China Sea each year. China has been increasingly involved in direct confrontations, most notably with the Philippines and Vietnam.\n\nThis year, tensions between the Philippines and China have escalated, with Chinese coast guard and other forces using powerful water cannons and dangerous blocking maneuvers to prevent food and other supplies from reaching Filipino navy personnel.\n\nThe Philippines, a treaty partner with the U.S., has been critical of other ASEAN countries for not doing more to get China to back away from its increasingly assertive approach.\n\nChina and the Philippines said Sunday they have reached a deal that they hope will end the confrontations, aiming to establish a mutually acceptable arrangement at the disputed area without conceding either side's territorial claims.\n\nThe rare deal could spark hope that similar arrangements could be forged by Beijing with other countries to avoid clashes while thorny territorial issues remain unresolved.\n\nASEAN has been working with China to produce a South China Sea code of conduct, which is expected to be part of the talks in Vientiane.\n\nAssociated Press writers David Rising in Bangkok and Edna Tarigan in Jakarta, Indonesia,

THE STRAITS TIMES\n\nHopes are not high that the talks in Vientiane will result in significant progress on the South China Sea issue, such as a code of conduct for nations operating in the body of water, but analysts warn that ASEAN must at least refrain from backpedaling on its existing position.\n\nPressure is mounting on Southeast Asia's top diplomats to ensure regional unity at this week's ASEAN talks in Laos, as analysts say ongoing disputes over rights to the South China Sea require a clear regional approach even as claimants increasingly opt to resolve issues in the troubled waters bilaterally.\n\nHopes are not high that the talks in Vientiane will result in significant progress on the South China Sea issue, such as a code of conduct (COC) for nations operating in the body of water, but analysts warn that ASEAN must at least refrain from backpedaling on its existing position.\n\nTensions resulting from China's sweeping claims to the South China Sea have worsened in recent years amid its rapid rise both regionally and internationally. The strategic sea quickly became a prominent theater of competition between Beijing and Washington.\n\nDiplomatic frictions have also arisen between China and other claimants to the resource-rich sea, including ASEAN members such as Malaysia and the Philippines. The latter joined hands with the United States and experienced a surge of clashes with Chinese vessels in the waters.\n\nThe 57th ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting (AMM), in which the matter is slated for discussion at length, will come days after Beijing and Manila reached a provisional agreement for rotation and resupply missions to the BRP Sierra Madre, a Philippine naval ship intentionally grounded on Second Thomas Shoal. The two claimants agreed that there was a need to de-escalate the situation through dialogue and consultation.\n\nTo ensure that de-escalation, the Philippine Foreign Ministry reportedly affirmed that both Manila and Beijing would \"not prejudice each other's positions in the South China Sea\".\n\nDespite the seemingly positive developments in the maritime dispute, analysts say only a region-wide approach could sustainably resolve the tensions in the disputed waters and that the onus is still on ASEAN to strengthen its unity and advance ongoing negotiations.\n\n\"Ideally, the South China Sea issue must be treated with a regional approach,\" said Lina Alexandra, head of the international relations department at Jakarta's Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). \"Any efforts by individual states to deal with China directly won't go anywhere.\"\n\nI Made Andi Arsana, an expert on the South China Sea dispute at Gadjah Mada University (UGM), concurred: \"ASEAN members can only have equal standing with China in negotiations if they are united.\"\n\nThe Indonesian foreign ministry said last week that the bloc, which has faced mounting pressure to step up and prevent the disputes from turning into an open conflict, was aware of the urgent need to advance key negotiations. It also vowed that the AMM, slated to kick off on Thursday, would see in-depth talks on the matter among ASEAN countries and the bloc's key partners, including the US and China.\n\nEnsuring ASEAN unity when talking with major partners might be a difficult task, as would making progress in negotiations, analysts said, given that each member country had varying degrees of reliance on both major powers.\n\n\"I don't have any expectations that they will produce something significant on the South China Sea,\" Andi said. \"I do hope, however, that they at least do not backpedal on their previous stance, which is the importance of upholding international law.\"\n\nOn the sidelines of the three-day meeting, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken will meet with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, according to the US State Department, as reported by AFP. They are expected to discuss \"the importance of adherence to international law in the South China Sea\".\n\nAside from the South China Sea, the Myanmar conflict, sparked by a military coup in 2021, is on the agenda in Vientiane.\n\nASEAN, of which Myanmar is a member, has led diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis but has made little progress. The junta has been excluded from the bloc's top-level meetings over its refusal to negotiate with its opponents and its brutal crackdown on dissent.\n\nBut Myanmar is expected to send a senior bureaucrat to the Vientiane talks. A Southeast Asian diplomat who will attend the meeting told AFP on condition of anonymity that the military's readiness to reengage with ASEAN diplomatically was a \"sign of the junta's position\".\n\nThe crisis has divided ASEAN, with Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines calling for tougher action against the junta. Thailand, on the other hand, has held its own bilateral talks with the junta leaders as well as with detained democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nThe AMM will produce at least six outcome documents, including a chairman statement, a joint communiqu\u00e9 and several joint statements with ASEAN's partners, including China.", "source": {"uri": "phnompenhpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The military leadership in Myanmar has so far ignored the plan and has raised questions about the bloc's efficiency and credibility to mediate for peace.\n\nBroader talks, including diplomats from elsewhere in the region including Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, are expected to focus on issues including the economy, security, climate and energy.\n\nRegional issues, including Cambodia's decision to build a canal off the Mekong River that Vietnam, which is downstream, worries could have ecological and security implications, as well as massive dam building projects in Laos further upstream could also feature in the meetings.\n\nIn Myanmar, the army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule, leading to increasing violence and a humanitarian crisis.\n\nIn an effort to put pressure on Myanmar, ASEAN has prohibited it from sending any political representatives to top-level meetings, and it has sent bureaucrats instead. Aung Kyaw Moe, the permanent secretary of Myanmar's Foreign Ministry, was expected to attend this week's meetings, which run through Saturday.\n\nMore than 5,400 people have been killed in the fighting in Myanmar and the military government has arrested more than 27,000 since the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. In addition, there are now more than 3 million displaced people in the country, with the numbers growing daily as fighting intensifies between the military and Myanmar's multiple ethnic militias as well as the so-called people's defense forces of military opponents.\n\nAs the needs of civilians grow, discussions on humanitarian assistance to Myanmar will also be a focus of the ASEAN talks, Bolbongse Vangphaen, head of the Thai Foreign Ministry's department for ASEAN, told reporters ahead of the meetings.\n\nThailand, which shares a long border with Myanmar, has already been heavily involved in providing humanitarian assistance, and Bolbongse said the country is ready to support the next phase of delivery being planned by the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management.\n\nHe did not say when or where the aid delivery would be.\n\nThailand initiated its first delivery of aid to Myanmar in March from the northern province of Tak. It was said to be distributed in Kayin state to approximately 20,000 out of millions of people displaced by fighting.\n\nLandlocked Laos is the bloc's poorest nation and one of its smallest, and many have expressed skepticism about how much it can accomplish while the crises mount. But it is also the first ASEAN chair that shares a border with Myanmar. Laos has already sent a special envoy to Myanmar for meetings with the head of the ruling military council and other top officials in an attempt to make progress on the peace plan.\n\nASEAN also has introduced a mechanism of trilateral informal consultation among its current, past, and future chairs, specifically for ensuring continuity in its response to the situation in Myanmar. The troika met for the first time on Wednesday, attended by Laos, Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nDulyapak Preecharush, a professor of Southeast Asia Studies at Bangkok's Thammasat University, said while ASEAN has shown continuous diplomatic efforts to mediate for peace, the progress has been slow. He said the bloc is not the only stakeholder, with China and India also major players -- and both attending the ASEAN meetings.\n\nProgress on Myanmar \"needs to start with countries that share borders with Myanmar, such as China, India and Thailand, to find a joint consensus to address the problems\" before expanding to other countries, he said.\n\nIn other issues, ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei are locked in maritime disputes with China over its claims of sovereignty over virtually all of the South China Sea, one of the world's most crucial waterways for shipping. Indonesia has also expressed concern about what it sees as Beijing's encroachment on its exclusive economic zone.\n\nAn estimated $5 trillion in international trade passes through the South China Sea each year. China has been increasingly involved in direct confrontations, most notably with the Philippines and Vietnam.\n\nThis year, tensions between the Philippines and China have escalated, with Chinese coast guard and other forces using powerful water cannons and dangerous blocking maneuvers to prevent food and other supplies from reaching Filipino navy personnel.\n\nThe Philippines, a treaty partner with the U.S., has been critical of other ASEAN countries for not doing more to get China to back away from its increasingly assertive approach.\n\nChina and the Philippines said Sunday they have reached a deal that they hope will end the confrontations, aiming to establish a mutually acceptable arrangement at the disputed area without conceding either side's territorial claims.\n\nThe rare deal could spark hope that similar arrangements could be forged by Beijing with other countries to avoid clashes while thorny territorial issues remain unresolved.\n\nASEAN has been working with China to produce a South China Sea code of conduct, which is expected to be part of the talks in Vientiane.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer David Rising in Bangkok contributed to this report.",

The military leadership in Myanmar has so far ignored the plan and has raised questions about the bloc's efficiency and credibility to mediate for peace.\n\nBroader talks, including diplomats from elsewhere in the region including Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, are expected to focus on issues including the economy, security, climate and energy.\n\nRegional issues, including Cambodia's decision to build a canal off the Mekong River that Vietnam, which is downstream, worries could have ecological and security implications, as well as massive dam building projects in Laos further upstream could also feature in the meetings.\n\nIn Myanmar, the army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule, leading to increasing violence and a humanitarian crisis.\n\nIn an effort to put pressure on Myanmar, ASEAN has prohibited it from sending any political representatives to top-level meetings, and it has sent bureaucrats instead. Aung Kyaw Moe, the permanent secretary of Myanmar's Foreign Ministry, was expected to attend this week's meetings, which run through Saturday.\n\nMore than 5,400 people have been killed in the fighting in Myanmar and the military government has arrested more than 27,000 since the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. In addition, there are now more than 3 million displaced people in the country, with the numbers growing daily as fighting intensifies between the military and Myanmar's multiple ethnic militias as well as the so-called people's defense forces of military opponents.\n\nAs the needs of civilians grow, discussions on humanitarian assistance to Myanmar will also be a focus of the ASEAN talks, Bolbongse Vangphaen, head of the Thai Foreign Ministry's department for ASEAN, told reporters ahead of the meetings.\n\nThailand, which shares a long border with Myanmar, has already been heavily involved in providing humanitarian assistance, and Bolbongse said the country is ready to support the next phase of delivery being planned by the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management.\n\nHe did not say when or where the aid delivery would be.\n\nThailand initiated its first delivery of aid to Myanmar in March from the northern province of Tak. It was said to be distributed in Kayin state to approximately 20,000 out of millions of people displaced by fighting.\n\nLandlocked Laos is the bloc's poorest nation and one of its smallest, and many have expressed skepticism about how much it can accomplish while the crises mount. But it is also the first ASEAN chair that shares a border with Myanmar. Laos has already sent a special envoy to Myanmar for meetings with the head of the ruling military council and other top officials in an attempt to make progress on the peace plan.\n\nASEAN also has introduced a mechanism of trilateral informal consultation among its current, past, and future chairs, specifically for ensuring continuity in its response to the situation in Myanmar. The troika met for the first time on Wednesday, attended by Laos, Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nDulyapak Preecharush, a professor of Southeast Asia Studies at Bangkok's Thammasat University, said while ASEAN has shown continuous diplomatic efforts to mediate for peace, the progress has been slow. He said the bloc is not the only stakeholder, with China and India also major players -- and both attending the ASEAN meetings.\n\nProgress on Myanmar \"needs to start with countries that share borders with Myanmar, such as China, India and Thailand, to find a joint consensus to address the problems\" before expanding to other countries, he said.\n\nIn other issues, ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei are locked in maritime disputes with China over its claims of sovereignty over virtually all of the South China Sea, one of the world's most crucial waterways for shipping. Indonesia has also expressed concern about what it sees as Beijing's encroachment on its exclusive economic zone.\n\nAn estimated $5 trillion in international trade passes through the South China Sea each year. China has been increasingly involved in direct confrontations, most notably with the Philippines and Vietnam.\n\nThis year, tensions between the Philippines and China have escalated, with Chinese coast guard and other forces using powerful water cannons and dangerous blocking maneuvers to prevent food and other supplies from reaching Filipino navy personnel.\n\nThe Philippines, a treaty partner with the U.S., has been critical of other ASEAN countries for not doing more to get China to back away from its increasingly assertive approach.\n\nChina and the Philippines said Sunday they have reached a deal that they hope will end the confrontations, aiming to establish a mutually acceptable arrangement at the disputed area without conceding either side's territorial claims.\n\nThe rare deal could spark hope that similar arrangements could be forged by Beijing with other countries to avoid clashes while thorny territorial issues remain unresolved.\n\nASEAN has been working with China to produce a South China Sea code of conduct, which is expected to be part of the talks in Vientiane.\n\nAssociated Press writer David Rising in Bangkok contributed to this report.\n\nFollow 's

They know what are his trigger points, what he likes, what he dislikes,\" he said.\n\nAlso on the agenda in Vientiane is the civil war in Myanmar, sparked by a military coup in 2021.\n\nASEAN, of which Myanmar is a member, has led diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis but has made little progress.\n\nThe junta is excluded from the bloc's top-level meetings over its refusal to negotiate with its opponents and its brutal crackdown on dissent.\n\nMyanmar is expected to send a senior bureaucrat to this week's meeting, according to several sources.\n\nThe military's readiness to re-engage with ASEAN diplomatically was a \"sign of the junta's weakened position\", a Southeast Asian diplomat, who will attend the talks, told AFP on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe generals have yet to make any meaningful counterattack following an offensive by ethnic armed groups in October that seized swaths of territory along the border with China.\n\nThe losses triggered rare public criticism of its top leadership.\n\n\"The centre is still solid under the junta,\" the diplomat said, warning Myanmar could \"become a failed state\".\n\nThe draft communique seen by AFP said ministers \"strongly condemned\" the continued violence.\n\nThe crisis has divided the bloc, with Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines calling for tougher action against the junta.\n\nThailand has held its own bilateral talks with the generals as well as detained democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nSupport HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report |

This meeting aims to emphasize the importance of adherence to international law regarding the South China Sea, a strategically crucial waterway claimed almost entirely by China despite an international court ruling dismissing the legitimacy of its claims.\n\nRecent clashes between Philippine and Chinese vessels have heightened tensions, with fears of a broader conflict involving the U.S. due to its defense commitments with Manila. The draft communique from the ASEAN meeting reflects concerns over \"serious incidents\" in the South China Sea, which have increased regional tensions and undermined peace and stability.\n\nIn addition to maritime disputes, the crisis in Myanmar is a key topic of discussion. Since the military coup in 2021, ASEAN has struggled to mediate the conflict effectively. The junta's exclusion from high-level meetings and its brutal crackdown on dissent have hampered progress. Myanmar is expected to send a senior bureaucrat to this meeting, indicating a possible willingness to engage diplomatically despite significant internal and external pressure.\n\nThe ASEAN bloc remains divided on the Myanmar issue, with countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines advocating for stronger measures against the junta, while Thailand has pursued bilateral talks with the military leadership and detained democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nThe discussions in Vientiane also reflect anticipation about potential shifts in U.S. foreign policy, particularly in light of the upcoming presidential election. Regional diplomats are preparing for the possibility of a Donald Trump victory and its implications for Southeast Asia.\n\nOverall, the ASEAN meeting underscores the complex geopolitical landscape of Southeast Asia, where maritime disputes and internal conflicts intersect with broader international interests and diplomatic strategies.", "source": {"uri": "wenewsenglish.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WE News English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ASEAN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South China Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vientiane", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vientiane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vientiane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Laos"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laos"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Laos"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wang Yi (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military dictatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aung San Suu Kyi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Conferences", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Educational_and_Academic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Educational and Academic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wenewsenglish.pk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ASEAN-.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755645", "eventUri": "eng-9755645", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nFor the ASEAN nations -- Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Brunei and Laos -- the violence in Myanmar is at the top of the agenda as the bloc struggles to implement its \"five-point consensus\" for peace.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe plan calls for the immediate cessation of violence in Myanmar, a dialogue among all concerned parties, mediation by an ASEAN special envoy, provision of humanitarian aid through ASEAN channels, and a visit to Myanmar by the special envoy to meet all concerned parties. The military leadership in Myanmar has so far ignored the plan and has raised questions about the bloc's efficiency and credibility to mediate for peace.\n\nBroader talks, including diplomats from elsewhere in the region including Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, are expected to focus on issues including the economy, security, climate and energy.\n\nRegional issues, including Cambodia's decision to build a canal off the Mekong River that Vietnam, which is downstream, worries could have ecological and security implications, as well as massive dam building projects in Laos further upstream could also feature in the meetings.\n\nIn Myanmar, the army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule, leading to increasing violence and a humanitarian crisis.\n\nIn an effort to put pressure on Myanmar, ASEAN has prohibited it from sending any political representatives to top-level meetings, and it has sent bureaucrats instead. Aung Kyaw Moe, the permanent secretary of Myanmar's Foreign Ministry, was expected to attend this week's meetings, which run through Saturday.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMore than 5,400 people have been killed in the fighting in Myanmar and the military government has arrested more than 27,000 since the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. In addition, there are now more than 3 million displaced people in the country, with the numbers growing daily as fighting intensifies between the military and Myanmar's multiple ethnic militias as well as the so-called people's defense forces of military opponents.\n\nAs the needs of civilians grow, discussions on humanitarian assistance to Myanmar will also be a focus of the ASEAN talks, Bolbongse Vangphaen, head of the Thai Foreign Ministry's department for ASEAN, told reporters ahead of the meetings.\n\nThailand, which shares a long border with Myanmar, has already been heavily involved in providing humanitarian assistance, and Bolbongse said the country is ready to support the next phase of delivery being planned by the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management.\n\nHe did not say when or where the aid delivery would be.\n\nThailand initiated its first delivery of aid to Myanmar in March from the northern province of Tak. It was said to be distributed in Kayin state to approximately 20,000 out of millions of people displaced by fighting.\n\nLandlocked Laos is the bloc's poorest nation and one of its smallest, and many have expressed skepticism about how much it can accomplish while the crises mount. But it is also the first ASEAN chair that shares a border with Myanmar. Laos has already sent a special envoy to Myanmar for meetings with the head of the ruling military council and other top officials in an attempt to make progress on the peace plan.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nASEAN also has introduced a mechanism of trilateral informal consultation among its current, past, and future chairs, specifically for ensuring continuity in its response to the situation in Myanmar. The troika met for the first time on Wednesday, attended by Laos, Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nDulyapak Preecharush, a professor of Southeast Asia Studies at Bangkok's Thammasat University, said while ASEAN has shown continuous diplomatic efforts to mediate for peace, the progress has been slow. He said the bloc is not the only stakeholder, with China and India also major players -- and both attending the ASEAN meetings.\n\nProgress on Myanmar \"needs to start with countries that share borders with Myanmar, such as China, India and Thailand, to find a joint consensus to address the problems\" before expanding to other countries, he said.\n\nIn other issues, ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei are locked in maritime disputes with China over its claims of sovereignty over virtually all of the South China Sea, one of the world's most crucial waterways for shipping. Indonesia has also expressed concern about what it sees as Beijing's encroachment on its exclusive economic zone.\n\nAn estimated $5 trillion in international trade passes through the South China Sea each year. China has been increasingly involved in direct confrontations, most notably with the Philippines and Vietnam.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThis year, tensions between the Philippines and China have escalated, with Chinese coast guard and other forces using powerful water cannons and dangerous blocking maneuvers to prevent food and other supplies from reaching Filipino navy personnel.\n\nThe Philippines, a treaty partner with the U.S., has been critical of other ASEAN countries for not doing more to get China to back away from its increasingly assertive approach.\n\nChina and the Philippines said Sunday they have reached a deal that they hope will end the confrontations, aiming to establish a mutually acceptable arrangement at the disputed area without conceding either side's territorial claims.\n\nThe rare deal could spark hope that similar arrangements could be forged by Beijing with other countries to avoid clashes while thorny territorial issues remain unresolved.\n\nASEAN has been working with China to produce a South China Sea code of conduct, which is expected to be part of the talks in Vientiane.\n\n___\n\nAssociated

The military leadership in Myanmar has so far ignored the plan and has raised questions about the bloc's efficiency and credibility to mediate for peace.\n\nBroader talks, including diplomats from elsewhere in the region including Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, are expected to focus on issues including the economy, security, climate and energy.\n\nRegional issues, including Cambodia's decision to build a canal off the Mekong River that Vietnam, which is downstream, worries could have ecological and security implications, as well as massive dam building projects in Laos further upstream could also feature in the meetings.\n\nIn Myanmar, the army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule, leading to increasing violence and a humanitarian crisis.\n\nIn an effort to put pressure on Myanmar, ASEAN has prohibited it from sending any political representatives to top-level meetings, and it has sent bureaucrats instead. Aung Kyaw Moe, the permanent secretary of Myanmar's Foreign Ministry, was expected to attend this week's meetings, which run through Saturday.\n\nMore than 5,400 people have been killed in the fighting in Myanmar and the military government has arrested more than 27,000 since the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. In addition, there are now more than 3 million displaced people in the country, with the numbers growing daily as fighting intensifies between the military and Myanmar's multiple ethnic militias as well as the so-called people's defense forces of military opponents.\n\nAs the needs of civilians grow, discussions on humanitarian assistance to Myanmar will also be a focus of the ASEAN talks, Bolbongse Vangphaen, head of the Thai Foreign Ministry's department for ASEAN, told reporters ahead of the meetings.\n\nThailand, which shares a long border with Myanmar, has already been heavily involved in providing humanitarian assistance, and Bolbongse said the country is ready to support the next phase of delivery being planned by the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management.\n\nHe did not say when or where the aid delivery would be.\n\nThailand initiated its first delivery of aid to Myanmar in March from the northern province of Tak. It was said to be distributed in Kayin state to approximately 20,000 out of millions of people displaced by fighting.\n\nLandlocked Laos is the bloc's poorest nation and one of its smallest, and many have expressed skepticism about how much it can accomplish while the crises mount. But it is also the first ASEAN chair that shares a border with Myanmar. Laos has already sent a special envoy to Myanmar for meetings with the head of the ruling military council and other top officials in an attempt to make progress on the peace plan.\n\nASEAN also has introduced a mechanism of trilateral informal consultation among its current, past, and future chairs, specifically for ensuring continuity in its response to the situation in Myanmar. The troika met for the first time on Wednesday, attended by Laos, Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nDulyapak Preecharush, a professor of Southeast Asia Studies at Bangkok's Thammasat University, said while ASEAN has shown continuous diplomatic efforts to mediate for peace, the progress has been slow. He said the bloc is not the only stakeholder, with China and India also major players -- and both attending the ASEAN meetings.\n\nProgress on Myanmar \"needs to start with countries that share borders with Myanmar, such as China, India and Thailand, to find a joint consensus to address the problems\" before expanding to other countries, he said.\n\nIn other issues, ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei are locked in maritime disputes with China over its claims of sovereignty over virtually all of the South China Sea, one of the world's most crucial waterways for shipping. Indonesia has also expressed concern about what it sees as Beijing's encroachment on its exclusive economic zone.\n\nAn estimated $5 trillion in international trade passes through the South China Sea each year. China has been increasingly involved in direct confrontations, most notably with the Philippines and Vietnam.\n\nThis year, tensions between the Philippines and China have escalated, with Chinese coast guard and other forces using powerful water cannons and dangerous blocking maneuvers to prevent food and other supplies from reaching Filipino navy personnel.\n\nThe Philippines, a treaty partner with the U.S., has been critical of other ASEAN countries for not doing more to get China to back away from its increasingly assertive approach.\n\nChina and the Philippines said Sunday they have reached a deal that they hope will end the confrontations, aiming to establish a mutually acceptable arrangement at the disputed area without conceding either side's territorial claims.\n\nThe rare deal could spark hope that similar arrangements could be forged by Beijing with other countries to avoid clashes while thorny territorial issues remain unresolved.\n\nASEAN has been working with China to produce a South China Sea code of conduct, which is expected to be part of the talks in Vientiane.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer David Rising in Bangkok contributed to this

Recognizing the interconnectedness of economic prosperity and regional security, the ASEAN member states embarked on initiatives such as the ASEAN Free Trade Area in 1992. The AFTA was formed to eliminate tariffs on most goods traded among the ASEAN member states, facilitating the movement of products and boosting intra-regional trade by about 222 times by 2016 compared with 1967 levels.\n\nASEAN now has 10 members, and the AFTA has not only spurred economic growth among them but also created an attractive market for external investors, particularly from the Northeast Asian economic giants.\n\nThe economic growth of Japan, ROK and China has been a significant driver of the region's long-term growth and integration. The three countries' robust appetite for raw materials and their position as manufacturing powerhouses have fueled trade with ASEAN. China is ASEAN's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade exceeding $722 billion, and Japan is the third exceeding $268 billion after United States' $420 billion, ROK is the forth with around $223 billion in 2022. The United States, incidentally, is ASEAN's second-largest trade partner with a two-way trade volume of $420 billion.\n\nBut ASEAN's economic journey has not been smooth. Indonesia, Malaysia, the ROK and Thailand experienced a serious economic downturn due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis. At that time, Japan played an extremely important role in helping revitalize ASEAN's economy as a whole by pumping in as much as $30 billion into the ASEAN and ROK economies under the \"New Miyazawa Initiative\" framework. China, too, played a key role in revitalizing the ASEAN economy by keeping the yuan's exchange rate flat. And Japan and the ROK, with their technological prowess, also played crucial roles in stabilizing the region's economy.\n\nJapanese FDI in ASEAN member states has played a vital role in developing infrastructure, and promoting technological advancements in fields such as electronics and automotive manufacturing. Now ASEAN-made cars are exported to the Middle East, Africa and even Japan. The ROK, too, has invested heavily in the region, particularly in Vietnam, contributing to its emergence as a manufacturing hub. To be sure, these investments have fostered knowledge transfer and upgrading of ASEAN workforce's skills, thereby enhancing the region's competitiveness in the global market. China, too, has invested heavily in ASEAN.\n\nThe establishment of the RCEP has further bolstered regional economic integration. This mega trade agreement among all the 10 ASEAN member states and China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand has created a free trade zone encompassing nearly a third of the global population (2.3 billion) and a cumulative GDP of $26 trillion. And the RCEP has eliminated tariffs on more than 90 percent of goods traded among the 15 signatory economies, thereby helping expand trade and attracting investments.\n\nBesides, the RCEP promotes the harmonization of regulations and standards, simplifying cross-border trade and creating a more predictable business environment. This economic integration has significant implications for the development of Southeast Asian countries, as increased trade flows lead to economies of scale, allowing ASEAN producers to benefit from relatively low production costs and compete more effectively in the global market.\n\nAlso, FDI by China, Japan and the ROK provides much-needed capital for infrastructure development, industrialization and job creation in the region, with a 2021 study by the Asian Development Bank estimating that the RCEP could increase signatory countries' incremental income by up to $514 billion by 2030.\n\nBut challenges remain. The gap in development level of ASEAN member states has created disparities in benefits, as less-developed countries struggle to compete with established players such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. In addition, a surge in imports from more advanced economies could threaten the domestic industries of some ASEAN member states. As such, effective policy response is needed to bridge these gaps and ensure inclusive growth.\n\nIn conclusion, ASEAN, China, Japan, and the ROK are playing a critical role in shaping the economic landscape of Asia and Oceania. Through trade, investment, technology transfer and supply chain integration, these economies are fostering a dynamic regional economy. The RCEP, with its focus on trade facilitation and harmonization of regulations, is a milestone in the region's economic journey. Moving forward, ensuring equitable distribution of benefits and narrowing the capacity and development gaps among the region's economies remain crucial for maximizing the positive impact of regional economic integration on the development of Asia and Oceania.\n\nThe author is an associate professor at the Graduate School of Management, Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University.\n\nThe views don't

Robust domestic demand, export recovery, improved tourism, and contained inflation support this growth outlook.\n\nThe ASEAN+3 region is projected to grow at 4.4% in 2024 and 4.3% in 2025, maintaining the forecasts from April. Key contributors to this growth include favorable export conditions, strong domestic demand, and a sustained recovery in tourism. Inflation, excluding Lao PDR and Myanmar, is forecasted to be 2.1% in 2024, with a slight increase to 2.3% in 2025. These projections are part of AMRO's July 2024 update of the ASEAN+3 Regional Economic Outlook (AREO).\n\nThe first notable observation is that growth momentum in ASEAN+3 continues to strengthen, driven by robust domestic demand. Retail sales have been buoyed by the recovery in travel and tourism, while improving export markets uplift business sentiment, albeit with some investment growth tempered by lingering economic uncertainties.\n\nAdditionally, the region's goods exports are on the rise, supported by increasing overseas demand and favorable export prices, despite concerns over shipping disruptions. Travel and tourism are nearing pre-pandemic levels, thanks to favorable visa policies and the return of Chinese tourists.\n\nInflation in the region has seen a slight uptick due to rising global energy and transportation prices. Factors such as the conflict in the Middle East and shipping disruptions in the Red Sea have escalated crude oil and freight costs. Despite contained overall inflation, core inflation remains elevated due to strong domestic demand.\n\nThe overall economic outlook is positive, with steady growth projections; however, risks such as U.S. monetary policies and geopolitical conflicts could affect the baseline forecasts. Asset market volatility and commodity price spikes are potential challenges, alongside economic slowdowns in China, the U.S., and Europe impacting trade and investment.\n\nSource: Five Key Takeaways from AMRO's July 2024 ASEAN+3 Regional Economic Outlook Update\n\nAMRO is an international organization that aims to contribute to securing the macroeconomic and financial resilience and stability of the ASEAN+3 region and its 14 member economies, including the 10 member states of ASEAN, China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Korea.", "source": {"uri": "thailand-business-news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Thailand Business News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ASEAN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laos"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Laos"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/b2thbz.siamnews.network/2024/07/Five-Key-Takeaways-from-AMROs-July-2024-ASEAN3-Regional-Economic.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755645", "eventUri": "eng-9755645", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Under the Laos chairmanship, the special envoy is approaching many parties.\"\n\nTENSIONS AT SEA\n\nASEAN is expected to push for the finalisation of a protracted code of conduct with Beijing on the South China Sea, an idea hatched in 2002 and in motion since 2017, with years spent agreeing on conditions for negotiating its contents.\n\nThere is renewed urgency amid persistent confrontations between Beijing and the U.S.-backed Philippines around disputed reefs inside Manila's exclusive economic zone, with Manila and Washington accusing China's coast guard of hostile actions.\n\nChina has insisted Philippine vessels are encroaching on its sovereign territory and has accused Manila of deliberate provocations.\n\nThe Philippines will in Laos propose the creation of an ASEAN Coast Guard Forum between its members to enable dialogue and law enforcement, according to its senior diplomat Theresa Lazaro, a plan likely to rile China.\n\nIndonesia is hopeful a code can be concluded by 2026. Some security analysts doubt a binding or enforceable text can be achieved, however, with some ASEAN states insisting it be based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\n\nChina says it backs a code, but does not recognise a 2016 arbitral ruling that said its claim to most of the South China Sea had no basis under UNCLOS, to which Beijing is a signatory.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will, according to a statement, press for international law to be adhered to in the South China Sea, a conduit for $3 trillion in annual trade, during summits at the weekend that will include Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.\n\nThey will be joined by counterparts of Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and Russia, among others, at Saturday's East Asia Summit and the security-focused ASEAN Regional Forum.\n\nThe summits are expected to discuss issues such as the war in Gaza, the conflict in Ukraine, food security, climate change, trade protectionism and North Korea's nuclear ambitions.\n\n(Additional reporying by Stanley Widianto in Jakarta and Karen Lema in Manila; Writing by Martin Petty; Editing by Himani Sarkar)", "source":

After my visit last October, I am very pleased to pay another official visit to this beautiful country on this occasion.\n\nJapan and ASEAN countries, of which Laos is a member, have built a relationship as trusted partners through years of cooperation and exchange in a wide range of fields.\n\nLast year, Japan welcomed Prime Minister Sonexay Siphandone and other leaders of ASEAN Member States to Tokyo for the Commemorative Summit for the 50th Year of ASEAN-Japan Friendship and Cooperation.\n\nAt this Special Summit, leaders from Japan and ASEAN members adopted a joint vision statement based on three pillars: \"Heart-to-Heart Partners across Generations,\" \"Partners for Co-creation of Economy and Society of the Future\", and \"Partners for Peace and Stability\".\n\nAt the upcoming ASEAN-Japan Foreign Ministers' Meeting, we would like to review the steady progress of cooperation under this new vision set forth by our leaders and reaffirm our commitments to further strengthen cooperation among us.\n\nIn particular, Japan strongly supports the theme \"Enhancing Connectivity and Resilience\" put forward by the Lao PDR as the Chair of ASEAN.\n\nUnder the Japan-ASEAN Comprehensive Connectivity Initiative, concrete cooperation projects, such as the Monsoon Wind Power Project for promoting cross-border electricity supply from the Lao PDR, are currently underway.\n\nJapan will continue to strengthen cooperation that contributes to ASEAN's connectivity, resilience, and community vision in a wide range of areas, including green transformation; digital transformation; culture and the arts; the environment; women, peace, and security; health; and human resource development.\n\nJapan-Laos relations have been steadily developing since last year. During the Lao PDR's tenure as ASEAN Chair this year, many Japanese dignitaries have visited Laos and reaffirmed the continuation of cooperative relations in various fields.\n\nI myself have already had three meetings with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Mr Saleumxay Kommasith since I became Minister for Foreign Affairs last year.\n\nWith a view to further advancing the Strategic Partnership between our two countries, I look forward to having another frank and constructive exchange of views on Laos' economic and social development, ASEAN-Japan cooperation, and regional and international affairs.\n\nWe are committed to continuing to support Laos in addressing its development challenges, including its debt problems, in cooperation with the international community.\n\nIn the first quarter (January-March) of Visit Laos Year 2024, the number of foreign tourists who visited Laos exceeded 1.1 million, a 36 percent increase compared with the previous year. We would like to work together in promoting tourism between Japan and Laos to ensure that this trend continues.\n\nI also recently learned that the traditional Lao textile motif of the dragon god, Naga, has been inscribed by UNESCO as a form of World Intangible Cultural Heritage. I would like to congratulate the people of Laos for securing international recognition of their rich culture and traditions, which have been handed down from generation to generation by Lao women.\n\nNext year's 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Laos and Japan will be an extremely important milestone in our bilateral relations. Next year is also the year of the Osaka-Kansai Expo, and we welcome Laos' participation.\n\nWe also look forward to welcoming Lao dignitaries to Japan in the coming years, especially for this memorable year, and to expanding government-to-government and party-to-party exchanges.\n\nCultural and people-to-people exchanges are the foundation of friendly relations between our two countries and I hope that exchanges at various levels will become even more active.\n\nI am particularly pleased to see that former students who studied in Japan are playing active roles in various fields as cabinet ministers among other key leadership roles. In the future, we would like to further promote our cultural and youth exchanges with the people of Laos.\n\nWe would like to continue to work closely with the Lao PDR to take the Strategic Partnership between our two countries to new heights and build our future together.

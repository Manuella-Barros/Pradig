Ron DeSantis was asked if he would support a special session on the strengthening of immigration enforcement, and he replied yes, he would.Noting that he supported a bill similar to Texas that makes it a state crime to illegally cross its borders.On Tuesday, the governor responded to a reporter's question on whether he would support a special session.\"I have no plans to call a special session,\" DeSantis responded.End of story, right? Well, no, because then he continued by suggesting the legislature may want one.\"But we don't have a plan necessarily to do a special session.

Eskamani said Floridians are also experiencing an increase in car insurance as well. She's worried that this upcoming hurricane season could be a setback for any improvements the state has seen.\n\n\"The reality is that Florida is a very high-risk state. And as we see more severe weather patterns, impact Florida, we just, we just are not ready. We're not braced for impact. At this point, if, God forbid, we have another intense hurricane season, which many meteorologists have already predicted is going to happen, we're going to see homeowners be in a place of devastation, unable to afford their premiums, some are just going to go uninsured if they don't have a mortgage, which is incredibly risky,\" she said.\n\nMORE: Property insurance expert says 8 new companies will increase competition, opportunities\n\nSo we want to know: Do you think lawmakers should hold another special session to address Florida's property insurance crisis?

Ron DeSantis made it clear earlier this week that lawmakers will not be tackling any more issues in the near future.\n\n\"I have no plans to call a special session,\" DeSantis said at a bill signing event along the Space Coast.\n\nThat statement was disheartening to state Rep. Jervonte Edmonds, D-West Palm Beach.\n\n\"It's truly disappointing,\" Edmonds said. \"Residents are still feeling the burden.\"\n\nThere had been speculation that a special session might be called on immigration, and some lawmakers had also suggested taking the opportunity to also look at homeowners insurance.\n\n\"Right now, it doesn't look like Tallahassee is focused on the insurance crisis,\" Edmonds said. \"Tallahassee is not as burdened as South Florida in the insurance crisis.\"\n\nFlorida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, a Republican, has been traveling the state to explain that progress on insurance is now happening after litigation reforms from a special session in December 2022.\n\n\"We are trying to turn the corner,\" Patronis said at an insurance roundtable in Clearwater in April.\n\nReal Estate News\n\nCancellations drive some back to Citizens Insurance Matt Sczesny 6:43 PM, May 06, 2024\n\nHe pointed to at least eight new insurers entering the state and even some companies asking for small rate reductions as proof of the turnaround.\n\nHowever, many Floridians are still seeing rate hikes and even cancellations come renewal time.\n\nUnited Policyholders, a nonprofit consumer-focused organization, acknowledged that the new funding of $200 million for the My Safe Florida Home program is a positive step, but they say more needs to be done.\n\n\"I think the whole thing has been highly politicized, which is unfortunate for the residents of the state,\" Amy Bach, the group's executive director.\n\nIf you have a question or comment about homeowners

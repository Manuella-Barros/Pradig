Scott replied: 'It's Miami'.\n\nHe also responded to the night's chaos with a series of light-hearted tweets to calm fan fears about his upcoming tour, and an edited version of his bleary-eyed mugshot snapped shortly after his arrest.\n\nScott then wrote 'lol' on X and shared his booking photo complete with photoshopped shades and earphones via Instagram stories.\n\nThe Sicko Mode singer is the former partner of Kylie Jenner, whom he has two young children with, Stormi and Aire.\n\nScott and the Kylie Cosmetics founder, 26, have had an on-off relationship since 2017, but are currently not together.\n\nJust a week before his June arrest, Scott was involved in a skirmish with Jenner's previous ex Tyga in Cannes.\n\nOver the years, the rapper has had a few run-ins with the law.\n\nMost notably, he was at the forefront of the 2021 'Astroworld' disaster, where 10 people lost their lives and hundreds more were injured while attending the rapper's music festival at NRG Park in Houston, Texas in a deadly crush.\n\nOn November 5, 2021, hundreds of people were filmed stampeding through a VIP entrance at the Live Nation-organized event, sparking fears of overcrowding and poor crowd control.\n\nTravis Scott was filmed continuing to perform after eight people were crushed to death - including two victims aged just 14 and 16 - with one witness saying it was a 'floor of bodies'.\n\nVideos circulating on Twitter showed the crowd chanting 'stop the show, stop the show!'\n\nWhile the concert was declared a mass casualty event at 9.38pm, the concert continued until 10:15pm, for which Scott - who was headlining and promoting the festival - was heavily criticised.\n\nThe rapper, alongside the festival's organisers Live Nation and ScoreMore faced numerous civil lawsuits accusing them of negligence and wrongful death.\n\nHowever in June last year, a Houston grand jury decided Scott would not face criminal charges for his role in the deadly crowd surge.\n\nIn November last year, two years after the stampede, Scott broke his silence on Astroworld in an interview with GQ, and said he was 'overly devastated' by the tragedy, adding that he thought about the disaster 'all the time'.\n\nScott said: 'Making music, you think about things that go on in life and things that happen in your life, and you dial in on things. That moment for families, for the city, you know, it was devastating. And when it came to making, like even finishing the album...I got back into it probably like, I don't know, months and months and months after.\n\n'And the idea of just even getting back into music, working on music and just even getting into that, was therapeutic of being able to channel some of the energy into production and sounds and finishing it.\n\n'I mean I was just overly devastated, you know. Yeah... Yeah, I always think about it. Those fans were like my family. You know, I love my fans to the utmost.\n\nIn May this year, Scott and Live Nation settled nine wrongful death lawsuits.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The incident is currently under investigation, as reported by ABC News.\n\nScott was in Paris for the Olympics and had attended the U.S. men's basketball team's semifinal victory over Serbia the previous night.\n\nKnown for his significant impact on hip hop, Scott, whose real name is Jacques Webster, has over 100 Billboard Hot 100 hits and four chart-topping singles: \"Sicko Mode,\" \"Highest in the Room,\" \"The Scotts,\" and \"Franchise.\"\n\nThe American rapper has two children with his ex-partner, Kylie Jenner, a media personality and businesswoman.\n\nIn June, Scott was involved in an incident in Miami Beach, where he was arrested on misdemeanor charges of trespassing and public intoxication.\n\nAccording to the police report, officers responded to a disturbance call at the city's marina around 1 a.m. and found Scott shouting obscenities at people on a yacht and refusing to leave despite being ordered to do so.\n\nDespite his intoxication and belligerent behavior, the caller declined to press charges, and Scott was allowed to leave. However, he continued to yell obscenities at the yacht's occupants as he walked away.\n\nAfter initially leaving in a waiting car, Travis Scott returned within five minutes, disregarding officers' repeated warnings to depart.\n\nHe continued his disruptive behavior, causing a disturbance that affected individuals on nearby boats and in adjacent buildings. This cycle repeated itself, with Scott briefly departing in the car only to return and resume his tumultuous actions, ignoring the officers' instructions to leave the area.\n\nWhen questioned about his drinking, he simply responded, \"It's Miami,\" leading to his arrest. Scott was released from Miami-Dade County Jail before noon after posting a $650 bond.\n\nHis attorney, Bradford Cohen, stated that Scott was \"detained due to a misunderstanding\" and emphasized that there was no physical altercation involved.\n\nCohen thanked the authorities for their cooperation in reaching a quick and fair resolution.\n\nScott, whose real name is Jacques Webster, is a prominent figure in hip-hop with over 100 Billboard Hot 100 hits and four number-one singles: \"Sicko Mode,\" \"Highest in the Room,\" \"The Scotts,\" and \"Franchise.\"", "source": {"uri":

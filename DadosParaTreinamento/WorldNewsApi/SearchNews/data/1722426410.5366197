{"id": 243349578, "title": "The qualities that Dr. Campbell\u2019s presence brings to the oil funds\u2019 committee are urgently needed", "text": "Dear Editor, It is heartening to learn that businessman Dr. Terrence Campbell is going to be on one of those, possible two, oil money committees. Guyanese need an independent pair of eyes, a thoughtfully critical one, and a presence that is its own check and balance on that precious fund. I think that Dr. Campbell fits the bill in all three spheres. With due respect to the other solid Guyanese nominated by the Bank of Guyana, I think that he would be weighed down by his institutional lineage to be much of any one of the three components I identified, and which are so urgently needed on those committees. From the moment I saw the composition of that body and its sublots, I felt that Guyanese were in for a turbulent time. Well, events have supported my interpretation of how matters would be. In essence, the oil fund has become like just any other cashbox that the PPP Government fastens its paws upon, viz., before long, it is plundered and pillaged at will. Huge amounts have been withdrawn from the still small fund, and no Guyanese has the faintest idea about what they have been spent on specifically. One bright bulb came up with an unbeatable idea for a spending label: \u201cnational development priorities.\u201d What could be more inspiring than such a construction? Other than when the funds disappear into the general budget and are comingled with all those public works projects\u2019 billions. Guyanese should get the drift by now, particularly those who have looked on with amazement at the fine work that the National Tender Board has delivered so far. Sportsmen and song and dance men now recognized as construction magicians. Newsmen (well, of a unique kind) duly rewarded for their company and heavy labours. Gold and diamond men transformed into road engineers. It is all mesmerizing, I must admit. But it is how the people\u2019s patrimony is redirected by the boys for the boys. I must check to see if there are any girls also having a good time. Or, those who don\u2019t fall into either of those two broad categories. From my perspective, that fund is so sacred that I would only draw nibbling amounts, or drop-dead emergency amounts, such as to rescue the GPL or, God forbid, should the seawall come into bad times. Besides that, it is conservative investments to earn some income. That is, until the fund has had enough deposits to justify any of the cowboy adventurism that the PPP brain trust engaged in, and which the people standing as sentinels over the money have proven adept at going along to get along, to ensure staying in the good graces of the big ones. I must learn to cultivate that kind of skill and stomach one day. It is why I think that Dr. Campbell could make a difference. He has the strength, the knowhow. For sure, he would be voted down, as a matter of routine. But the big spinners would have to refine their arm ball well. In other words, the passive and docile could be history. Just like the, ah, housecleaning that has accompanied Dr. Campbell\u2019s approval, then announcement, and last appointment. Why the delay is what I am pondering. Perhaps, the place needs to be, shall I say, freshened. The fact that one Guyanese who should be about the Guyanese people first is around leads to comfort. I may be the only one around who thinks like this. I leave with this parting note for Dr. Campbell: a few years back, a well-pedigreed PPP luminary said this to me at our first and only face-to-face: whatever is contemplated, stay where present. It is the same business that the US Government is paying so much attention to nowadays.

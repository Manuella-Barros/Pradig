To be able to share this experience with him is one I'll never forget.\" Guaty is active on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/camilleguaty/) and invites her fans to stay in touch with her there.\n\nQ: Where did you film \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\"?\n\nA: \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" was shot in Atlanta, and I absolutely loved it there! I've lived in Atlanta while shooting other movies and TV shows, so the familiarity was nice. The food is incredible. I'll always talk to the locals, find a few favorite spots and hit those toward the end of the shoot. [One of] my favorite things about Atlanta is the music and art scene. You can be walking down the street on a Saturday afternoon and find a random piano sitting there waiting for someone to play it. And, boy, do they. I've seen crowds gather as people take turns playing their favorite tunes ... onlookers start dancing! It's pretty incredible. They definitely know how to embrace life over there.\n\nQ: What can you share about your experience filming the upcoming Max series \"Duster\"?\n\nA: Well, I'm working with J.J. Abrams so I can tick that off my bucket list. I let out the biggest scream when I found out I booked the role. I think my husband thought I fell off the roof. I really hope people like it. It's funny, dark and a bit quirky. We filmed season one in Albuquerque. It didn't take long before I immersed myself in the culture. Albuquerque is a slow burn. The food scene is great and very underrated. The mountain views, clouds and sunsets are so picturesque. It's no wonder so many artists paint the most magical colorful sky.\n\nQ: Of all the characters you've played throughout your career, which one would make a great or horrible travel companion?\n\nA: My favorite travel buddies are those with an adventurous spirit and those who say yes! A loose, go with the flow vibe always turns into my favorite vacations. Hands down I'd take Piper Nielson from \"Las Vegas\" with me anywhere. She has such a zest for life and would be game for anything. On the flip side, I probably wouldn't want to travel with a wanted criminal! So I'd have to say I'd leave La Fiera from \"The Rookie\" home.\n\nQ: Do you have any upcoming trips planned?\n\nA: We're heading to London to visit my husband's family. Normally we take a little adventure to Henley-on-Thames. It's magical along the Thames River. We spend afternoons on a boat or play with the chickens in the garden. The center of town, Marlow, feels like a storybook. I could spend days there.\n\nQ: What is your favorite vacation destination?\n\nA: I traveled throughout Italy one year and ended up in Gran Sasso d'Italia, mountain group, in the Abruzzo region. We rented a car and drove until we saw something we liked. We grilled meat on a stick above an open fire pit, hiked through the hillside with sheep and cows. It's the unexpectedness for me. If I can immerse myself in the culture, people and good food, then I'm in heaven.\n\nQ: What's the most important thing you've learned from your travels?\n\nA: Life feels different when you're on vacation. It slows down. You look up more than down, you taste new foods, take in new scenery and veer away from your norm. The trick is to sustain that bliss when you get back home. It's easy to slip back to our old ways, but it's braver to make the change.\n\nQ: What are your five favorite cities?\n\nA: Abruzzo, Barcelona, Tokyo, Paris, Bali.\n\nQ: Where would you like to go that you have never been to before?\n\nA: Switzerland in the summer. It looks so magical.\n\nQ: When you go away, what are some of your must-have items?\n\nA: A great pair of sneakers, a pair of pants or jeans that can transition from day to night, the hair dryer brush, good shampoo, conditioner and a moisturizing cream.\n\nQ: What is your guilty pleasure when you're on the road?\n\nA: Vintage shopping. I love finding a beautiful piece of jewelry or a unique piece of art. They symbolize wonderful memories that I'll cherish forever.\n\nQ: What kind of research do you do before you go away on a trip?\n\nA: What do I not do? I love to research so when I get there, I can just let go of it all. Places to eat and where to stay are my top searches. I hate to waste a meal at a bad place when on holiday. So finding a few key places to dine is essential. But also, one of my most favorite memories was in Paris, finding a cheese shop, grabbing our favorite fromage, a baguette, fresh fruit and a bottle of wine.\n\n(Jae-Ha Kim is a New York Times bestselling author and journalist.

They symbolize wonderful memories that I'll cherish forever.\n\nQ: What kind of research do you do before you go away on a trip?\n\nA: What do I not do? I love to research so when I get there, I can just let go of it all. Places to eat and where to stay are my top searches. I hate to waste a meal at a bad place when on holiday. So finding a few key places to dine is essential. But also, one of my most favorite memories was in Paris, finding a cheese shop, grabbing our favorite fromage, a baguette, fresh fruit and a bottle of wine.\n\n(Jae-Ha Kim is a New York Times bestselling author and journalist.

We read it at least five times a week. Every time he sees the policeman in the book, he says, 'Mommy, that's you!' To be able to share this experience with him is one I'll never forget.\" Guaty is active on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/camilleguaty/) and invites her fans to stay in touch with her there.\n\nQ: Where did you film \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\"?\n\nA: \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" was shot in Atlanta, and I absolutely loved it there! I've lived in Atlanta while shooting other movies and TV shows, so the familiarity was nice. The food is incredible. I'll always talk to the locals, find a few favorite spots and hit those toward the end of the shoot. [One of] my favorite things about Atlanta is the music and art scene. You can be walking down the street on a Saturday afternoon and find a random piano sitting there waiting for someone to play it. And, boy, do they. I've seen crowds gather as people take turns playing their favorite tunes ... onlookers start dancing! It's pretty incredible. They definitely know how to embrace life over there.\n\nQ: What can you share about your experience filming the upcoming Max series \"Duster\"?\n\nA: Well, I'm working with J.J. Abrams so I can tick that off my bucket list. I let out the biggest scream when I found out I booked the role. I think my husband thought I fell off the roof. I really hope people like it. It's funny, dark and a bit quirky. We filmed season one in Albuquerque. It didn't take long before I immersed myself in the culture. Albuquerque is a slow burn. The food scene is great and very underrated. The mountain views, clouds and sunsets are so picturesque. It's no wonder so many artists paint the most magical colorful sky.\n\nQ: Of all the characters you've played throughout your career, which one would make a great or horrible travel companion?\n\nA: My favorite travel buddies are those with an adventurous spirit and those who say yes! A loose, go with the flow vibe always turns into my favorite vacations. Hands down I'd take Piper Nielson from \"Las Vegas\" with me anywhere. She has such a zest for life and would be game for anything. On the flip side, I probably wouldn't want to travel with a wanted criminal! So I'd have to say I'd leave La Fiera from \"The Rookie\" home.\n\nQ: Do you have any upcoming trips planned?\n\nA: We're heading to London to visit my husband's family. Normally we take a little adventure to Henley-on-Thames. It's magical along the Thames River. We spend afternoons on a boat or play with the chickens in the garden. The center of town, Marlow, feels like a storybook. I could spend days there.\n\nQ: What is your favorite vacation destination?\n\nA: I traveled throughout Italy one year and ended up in Gran Sasso d'Italia, mountain group, in the Abruzzo region. We rented a car and drove until we saw something we liked. We grilled meat on a stick above an open fire pit, hiked through the hillside with sheep and cows. It's the unexpectedness for me. If I can immerse myself in the culture, people and good food, then I'm in heaven.\n\nQ: What's the most important thing you've learned from your travels?\n\nA: Life feels different when you're on vacation. It slows down. You look up more than down, you taste new foods, take in new scenery and veer away from your norm. The trick is to sustain that bliss when you get back home. It's easy to slip back to our old ways, but it's braver to make the change.\n\nQ: Where would you like to go that you have never been to before?\n\nA: Switzerland in the summer. It looks so magical.\n\nQ: When you go away, what are some of your must-have items?\n\nA: A great pair of sneakers, a pair of pants or jeans that can transition from day to night, the hair dryer brush, good shampoo, conditioner and a moisturizing cream.\n\nQ: What is your guilty pleasure when you're on the road?\n\nA: Vintage shopping.

It looks so magical.\n\nQ: When you go away, what are some of your must-have items?\n\nA: A great pair of sneakers, a pair of pants or jeans that can transition from day to night, the hair dryer brush, good shampoo, conditioner and a moisturizing cream.\n\nQ: What is your guilty pleasure when you're on the road?\n\nA: Vintage shopping. I love finding a beautiful piece of jewelry or a unique piece of art. They symbolize wonderful memories that I'll cherish forever.\n\nQ: What kind of research do you do before you go away on a trip?\n\nA: What do I not do? I love to research so when I get there, I can just let go of it all. Places to eat and where to stay are my top searches. I hate to waste a meal at a bad place when on holiday. So finding a few key places to dine is essential. But also, one of my most favorite memories was in Paris, finding a cheese shop, grabbing our favorite fromage, a baguette, fresh fruit and a bottle of wine.\n\n(Jae-Ha Kim is a New York Times bestselling author and journalist.

Camille Guaty", "body": "\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" actor Camille Guaty said going with the flow in a new country makes for the best adventures. (Braden Moran)\n\nJae-Ha Kim, Tribune Content Agency\n\n\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" star Camille Guaty said that being cast as Junior Detective Silva in the film was serendipitous. \"Becoming a mom was a really hard journey and I find it so magical that one of my first jobs as a mom was [this film],\" the actress said from her Nashville home. \"It has become one of my son's favorite books. We read it at least five times a week. Every time he sees the policeman in the book, he says, 'Mommy, that's you!' To be able to share this experience with him is one I'll never forget.\" Guaty is active on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/camilleguaty/) and invites her fans to stay in touch with her there.\n\nQ: Where did you film \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\"?\n\nA: \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" was shot in Atlanta, and I absolutely loved it there! I've lived in Atlanta while shooting other movies and TV shows, so the familiarity was nice. The food is incredible. I'll always talk to the locals, find a few favorite spots and hit those toward the end of the shoot. [One of] my favorite things about Atlanta is the music and art scene. You can be walking down the street on a Saturday afternoon and find a random piano sitting there waiting for someone to play it. And, boy, do they. I've seen crowds gather as people take turns playing their favorite tunes ... onlookers start dancing! It's pretty incredible. They definitely know how to embrace life over there.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Abrams so I can tick that off my bucket list. I let out the biggest scream when I found out I booked the role. I think my husband thought I fell off the roof. I really hope people like it. It's funny, dark and a bit quirky. We filmed season one in Albuquerque. It didn't take long before I immersed myself in the culture. Albuquerque is a slow burn. The food scene is great and very underrated. The mountain views, clouds and sunsets are so picturesque. It's no wonder so many artists paint the most magical colorful sky.\n\nQ: Of all the characters you've played throughout your career, which one would make a great or horrible travel companion?\n\nA: My favorite travel buddies are those with an adventurous spirit and those who say yes! A loose, go with the flow vibe always turns into my favorite vacations. Hands down I'd take Piper Nielson from \"Las Vegas\" with me anywhere. She has such a zest for life and would be game for anything. On the flip side, I probably wouldn't want to travel with a wanted criminal! So I'd have to say I'd leave La Fiera from \"The Rookie\" home.\n\nQ: Do you have any upcoming trips planned?\n\nA: We're heading to London to visit my husband's family. Normally we take a little adventure to Henley-on-Thames. It's magical along the Thames River. We spend afternoons on a boat or play with the chickens in the garden. The center of town, Marlow, feels like a storybook. I could spend days there.\n\nQ: What is your favorite vacation destination?\n\nA: I traveled throughout Italy one year and ended up in Gran Sasso d'Italia, mountain group, in the Abruzzo region. We rented a car and drove until we saw something we liked. We grilled meat on a stick above an open fire pit, hiked through the hillside with sheep and cows. It's the unexpectedness for me. If I can immerse myself in the culture, people and good food, then I'm in heaven.\n\nQ: What's the most important thing you've learned from your travels?\n\nA: Life feels different when you're on vacation. It slows down. You look up more than down, you taste new foods, take in new scenery and veer away from your norm. The trick is to sustain that bliss when you get back home. It's easy to slip back to our old ways, but it's braver to make the change.\n\nQ: What are your five favorite cities?\n\nA: Abruzzo, Barcelona, Tokyo, Paris, Bali.\n\nQ: Where would you like to go that you have never been to before?\n\nA: Switzerland in the summer. It looks so magical.\n\nQ: When you go away, what are some of your must-have items?\n\nA: A great pair of sneakers, a pair of pants or jeans that can transition from day to night, the hair dryer brush, good shampoo, conditioner and a moisturizing cream.\n\nQ: What is your guilty pleasure when you're on the road?\n\nA: Vintage shopping.

Camille Guaty", "body": "\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" actor Camille Guaty said going with the flow in a new country makes for the best adventures. (Braden Moran)\n\nJae-Ha Kim, Tribune Content Agency\n\n\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" star Camille Guaty said that being cast as Junior Detective Silva in the film was serendipitous. \"Becoming a mom was a really hard journey and I find it so magical that one of my first jobs as a mom was [this film],\" the actress said from her Nashville home. \"It has become one of my son's favorite books. We read it at least five times a week. Every time he sees the policeman in the book, he says, 'Mommy, that's you!' To be able to share this experience with him is one I'll never forget.\" Guaty is active on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/camilleguaty/) and invites her fans to stay in touch with her there.\n\nQ: Where did you film \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\"?\n\nA: \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" was shot in Atlanta, and I absolutely loved it there! I've lived in Atlanta while shooting other movies and TV shows, so the familiarity was nice. The food is incredible. I'll always talk to the locals, find a few favorite spots and hit those toward the end of the shoot. [One of] my favorite things about Atlanta is the music and art scene. You can be walking down the street on a Saturday afternoon and find a random piano sitting there waiting for someone to play it. And, boy, do they. I've seen crowds gather as people take turns playing their favorite tunes ... onlookers start dancing! It's pretty incredible. They definitely know how to embrace life over there.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Abrams so I can tick that off my bucket list. I let out the biggest scream when I found out I booked the role. I think my husband thought I fell off the roof. I really hope people like it. It's funny, dark and a bit quirky. We filmed season one in Albuquerque. It didn't take long before I immersed myself in the culture. Albuquerque is a slow burn. The food scene is great and very underrated. The mountain views, clouds and sunsets are so picturesque. It's no wonder so many artists paint the most magical colorful sky.\n\nQ: Of all the characters you've played throughout your career, which one would make a great or horrible travel companion?\n\nA: My favorite travel buddies are those with an adventurous spirit and those who say yes! A loose, go with the flow vibe always turns into my favorite vacations. Hands down I'd take Piper Nielson from \"Las Vegas\" with me anywhere. She has such a zest for life and would be game for anything. On the flip side, I probably wouldn't want to travel with a wanted criminal! So I'd have to say I'd leave La Fiera from \"The Rookie\" home.\n\nQ: Do you have any upcoming trips planned?\n\nA: We're heading to London to visit my husband's family. Normally we take a little adventure to Henley-on-Thames. It's magical along the Thames River. We spend afternoons on a boat or play with the chickens in the garden. The center of town, Marlow, feels like a storybook. I could spend days there.\n\nQ: What is your favorite vacation destination?\n\nA: I traveled throughout Italy one year and ended up in Gran Sasso d'Italia, mountain group, in the Abruzzo region. We rented a car and drove until we saw something we liked. We grilled meat on a stick above an open fire pit, hiked through the hillside with sheep and cows. It's the unexpectedness for me. If I can immerse myself in the culture, people and good food, then I'm in heaven.\n\nQ: What's the most important thing you've learned from your travels?\n\nA: Life feels different when you're on vacation. It slows down. You look up more than down, you taste new foods, take in new scenery and veer away from your norm. The trick is to sustain that bliss when you get back home. It's easy to slip back to our old ways, but it's braver to make the change.\n\nQ: What are your five favorite cities?\n\nA: Abruzzo, Barcelona, Tokyo, Paris, Bali.\n\nQ: Where would you like to go that you have never been to before?\n\nA: Switzerland in the summer. It looks so magical.\n\nQ: When you go away, what are some of your must-have items?\n\nA: A great pair of sneakers, a pair of pants or jeans that can transition from day to night, the hair dryer brush, good shampoo, conditioner and a moisturizing cream.\n\nQ: What is your guilty pleasure when you're on the road?\n\nA: Vintage shopping. I love finding a beautiful piece of jewelry or a unique piece of art. They symbolize wonderful memories that I'll cherish forever.\n\nQ: What kind of research do you do before you go away on a trip?\n\nA: What do I not do? I love to research so when I get there, I can just let go of it all. Places to eat and where to stay are my top searches. I hate to waste a meal at a bad place when on holiday. So finding a few key places to dine is essential. But also, one of my most favorite memories was in Paris, finding a cheese shop, grabbing our favorite fromage, a baguette, fresh fruit and a bottle of wine.\n\n(Jae-Ha Kim is a New York Times bestselling author and journalist.

Camille Guaty", "body": "\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" actor Camille Guaty said going with the flow in a new country makes for the best adventures. (Braden Moran)\n\nJae-Ha Kim, Tribune Content Agency\n\n\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" star Camille Guaty said that being cast as Junior Detective Silva in the film was serendipitous. \"Becoming a mom was a really hard journey and I find it so magical that one of my first jobs as a mom was [this film],\" the actress said from her Nashville home. \"It has become one of my son's favorite books. We read it at least five times a week. Every time he sees the policeman in the book, he says, 'Mommy, that's you!' To be able to share this experience with him is one I'll never forget.\" Guaty is active on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/camilleguaty/) and invites her fans to stay in touch with her there.\n\nQ: Where did you film \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\"?\n\nA: \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" was shot in Atlanta, and I absolutely loved it there! I've lived in Atlanta while shooting other movies and TV shows, so the familiarity was nice. The food is incredible. I'll always talk to the locals, find a few favorite spots and hit those toward the end of the shoot. [One of] my favorite things about Atlanta is the music and art scene. You can be walking down the street on a Saturday afternoon and find a random piano sitting there waiting for someone to play it. And, boy, do they. I've seen crowds gather as people take turns playing their favorite tunes ... onlookers start dancing! It's pretty incredible. They definitely know how to embrace life over there.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Abrams so I can tick that off my bucket list. I let out the biggest scream when I found out I booked the role. I think my husband thought I fell off the roof. I really hope people like it. It's funny, dark and a bit quirky. We filmed season one in Albuquerque. It didn't take long before I immersed myself in the culture. Albuquerque is a slow burn. The food scene is great and very underrated. The mountain views, clouds and sunsets are so picturesque. It's no wonder so many artists paint the most magical colorful sky.\n\nQ: Of all the characters you've played throughout your career, which one would make a great or horrible travel companion?\n\nA: My favorite travel buddies are those with an adventurous spirit and those who say yes! A loose, go with the flow vibe always turns into my favorite vacations. Hands down I'd take Piper Nielson from \"Las Vegas\" with me anywhere. She has such a zest for life and would be game for anything. On the flip side, I probably wouldn't want to travel with a wanted criminal! So I'd have to say I'd leave La Fiera from \"The Rookie\" home.\n\nQ: Do you have any upcoming trips planned?\n\nA: We're heading to London to visit my husband's family. Normally we take a little adventure to Henley-on-Thames. It's magical along the Thames River. We spend afternoons on a boat or play with the chickens in the garden. The center of town, Marlow, feels like a storybook. I could spend days there.\n\nQ: What is your favorite vacation destination?\n\nA: I traveled throughout Italy one year and ended up in Gran Sasso d'Italia, mountain group, in the Abruzzo region. We rented a car and drove until we saw something we liked. We grilled meat on a stick above an open fire pit, hiked through the hillside with sheep and cows. It's the unexpectedness for me. If I can immerse myself in the culture, people and good food, then I'm in heaven.\n\nQ: What's the most important thing you've learned from your travels?\n\nA: Life feels different when you're on vacation. It slows down. You look up more than down, you taste new foods, take in new scenery and veer away from your norm. The trick is to sustain that bliss when you get back home. It's easy to slip back to our old ways, but it's braver to make the change.\n\nQ: What are your five favorite cities?\n\nA: Abruzzo, Barcelona, Tokyo, Paris, Bali.\n\nQ: Where would you like to go that you have never been to before?\n\nA: Switzerland in the summer. It looks so magical.\n\nQ: When you go away, what are some of your must-have items?\n\nA: A great pair of sneakers, a pair of pants or jeans that can transition from day to night, the hair dryer brush, good shampoo, conditioner and a moisturizing cream.\n\nQ: What is your guilty pleasure when you're on the road?\n\nA: Vintage shopping. I love finding a beautiful piece of jewelry or a unique piece of art. They symbolize wonderful memories that I'll cherish forever.\n\nQ: What kind of research do you do before you go away on a trip?\n\nA: What do I not do? I love to research so when I get there, I can just let go of it all. Places to eat and where to stay are my top searches. I hate to waste a meal at a bad place when on holiday. So finding a few key places to dine is essential. But also, one of my most favorite memories was in Paris, finding a cheese shop, grabbing our favorite fromage, a baguette, fresh fruit and a bottle of wine.\n\n(Jae-Ha Kim is a New York Times bestselling author and journalist.

Camille Guaty", "body": "\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" actor Camille Guaty said going with the flow in a new country makes for the best adventures. (Braden Moran)\n\nJae-Ha Kim, Tribune Content Agency\n\n\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" star Camille Guaty said that being cast as Junior Detective Silva in the film was serendipitous. \"Becoming a mom was a really hard journey and I find it so magical that one of my first jobs as a mom was [this film],\" the actress said from her Nashville home. \"It has become one of my son's favorite books. We read it at least five times a week. Every time he sees the policeman in the book, he says, 'Mommy, that's you!' To be able to share this experience with him is one I'll never forget.\" Guaty is active on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/camilleguaty/) and invites her fans to stay in touch with her there.\n\nQ: Where did you film \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\"?\n\nA: \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" was shot in Atlanta, and I absolutely loved it there! I've lived in Atlanta while shooting other movies and TV shows, so the familiarity was nice. The food is incredible. I'll always talk to the locals, find a few favorite spots and hit those toward the end of the shoot. [One of] my favorite things about Atlanta is the music and art scene. You can be walking down the street on a Saturday afternoon and find a random piano sitting there waiting for someone to play it. And, boy, do they. I've seen crowds gather as people take turns playing their favorite tunes ... onlookers start dancing! It's pretty incredible. They definitely know how to embrace life over there.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Abrams so I can tick that off my bucket list. I let out the biggest scream when I found out I booked the role. I think my husband thought I fell off the roof. I really hope people like it. It's funny, dark and a bit quirky. We filmed season one in Albuquerque. It didn't take long before I immersed myself in the culture. Albuquerque is a slow burn. The food scene is great and very underrated. The mountain views, clouds and sunsets are so picturesque. It's no wonder so many artists paint the most magical colorful sky.\n\nQ: Of all the characters you've played throughout your career, which one would make a great or horrible travel companion?\n\nA: My favorite travel buddies are those with an adventurous spirit and those who say yes! A loose, go with the flow vibe always turns into my favorite vacations. Hands down I'd take Piper Nielson from \"Las Vegas\" with me anywhere. She has such a zest for life and would be game for anything. On the flip side, I probably wouldn't want to travel with a wanted criminal! So I'd have to say I'd leave La Fiera from \"The Rookie\" home.\n\nQ: Do you have any upcoming trips planned?\n\nA: We're heading to London to visit my husband's family. Normally we take a little adventure to Henley-on-Thames. It's magical along the Thames River. We spend afternoons on a boat or play with the chickens in the garden. The center of town, Marlow, feels like a storybook. I could spend days there.\n\nQ: What is your favorite vacation destination?\n\nA: I traveled throughout Italy one year and ended up in Gran Sasso d'Italia, mountain group, in the Abruzzo region. We rented a car and drove until we saw something we liked. We grilled meat on a stick above an open fire pit, hiked through the hillside with sheep and cows. It's the unexpectedness for me. If I can immerse myself in the culture, people and good food, then I'm in heaven.\n\nQ: What's the most important thing you've learned from your travels?\n\nA: Life feels different when you're on vacation. It slows down. You look up more than down, you taste new foods, take in new scenery and veer away from your norm. The trick is to sustain that bliss when you get back home. It's easy to slip back to our old ways, but it's braver to make the change.\n\nQ: What are your five favorite cities?\n\nA: Abruzzo, Barcelona, Tokyo, Paris, Bali.\n\nQ: Where would you like to go that you have never been to before?\n\nA: Switzerland in the summer. It looks so magical.\n\nQ: When you go away, what are some of your must-have items?\n\nA: A great pair of sneakers, a pair of pants or jeans that can transition from day to night, the hair dryer brush, good shampoo, conditioner and a moisturizing cream.\n\nQ: What is your guilty pleasure when you're on the road?\n\nA: Vintage shopping. I love finding a beautiful piece of jewelry or a unique piece of art. They symbolize wonderful memories that I'll cherish forever.\n\nQ: What kind of research do you do before you go away on a trip?\n\nA: What do I not do? I love to research so when I get there, I can just let go of it all. Places to eat and where to stay are my top searches. I hate to waste a meal at a bad place when on holiday. So finding a few key places to dine is essential. But also, one of my most favorite memories was in Paris, finding a cheese shop, grabbing our favorite fromage, a baguette, fresh fruit and a bottle of wine.\n\n(Jae-Ha Kim is a New York Times bestselling author and journalist.

(Braden Moran)\n\nJae-Ha Kim, Tribune Content Agency\n\n\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" star Camille Guaty said that being cast as Junior Detective Silva in the film was serendipitous. \"Becoming a mom was a really hard journey and I find it so magical that one of my first jobs as a mom was [this film],\" the actress said from her Nashville home. \"It has become one of my son's favorite books.

To be able to share this experience with him is one I'll never forget.\" Guaty is active on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/camilleguaty/) and invites her fans to stay in touch with her there.\n\nQ: Where did you film \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\"?\n\nA: \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" was shot in Atlanta, and I absolutely loved it there! I've lived in Atlanta while shooting other movies and TV shows, so the familiarity was nice. The food is incredible. I'll always talk to the locals, find a few favorite spots and hit those toward the end of the shoot. [One of] my favorite things about Atlanta is the music and art scene. You can be walking down the street on a Saturday afternoon and find a random piano sitting there waiting for someone to play it. And, boy, do they. I've seen crowds gather as people take turns playing their favorite tunes ... onlookers start dancing! It's pretty incredible. They definitely know how to embrace life over there.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nReview: T-Pain deserved better than what fans gave him at the Mississippi Valley Fair Timeline: Deere has cut 2,700 jobs in 10 months in Iowa and Illinois, 1,300 in Quad-Cities UAW releases statement on John Deere layoffs, says cuts 'kill good American jobs' Bettendorf police arrest man on suspicion of human trafficking, pimping Review: The bests and worsts of Friday at Hinterland Music Festival Davenport man arrested in connection with robbery, shooting incident Man accused of stealing car at gunpoint in Davenport Editorial: Davenport can change trajectory with new city administrator Mount Mercy and St. Ambrose to combine into single university Gannon Hanevold: The three strangest foods we found at the Mississippi Valley Fair John Deere lays off more than 300 in Moline and East Moline in latest round of cuts Parents of murder victim angry with plea deal that offered reduced charge and prison sentence Five named to St. Ambrose Hall of Fame Driver of garbage truck struck by train in Scott County suffers minor injuries Prosecutors ask to dismiss cases against two men for 2023 killing in Davenport\n\nQ: What can you share about your experience filming the upcoming Max series \"Duster\"?\n\nA: Well, I'm working with J.J. Abrams so I can tick that off my bucket list. I let out the biggest scream when I found out I booked the role. I think my husband thought I fell off the roof. I really hope people like it. It's funny, dark and a bit quirky. We filmed season one in Albuquerque. It didn't take long before I immersed myself in the culture. Albuquerque is a slow burn. The food scene is great and very underrated. The mountain views, clouds and sunsets are so picturesque. It's no wonder so many artists paint the most magical colorful sky.\n\nQ: Of all the characters you've played throughout your career, which one would make a great or horrible travel companion?\n\nA: My favorite travel buddies are those with an adventurous spirit and those who say yes! A loose, go with the flow vibe always turns into my favorite vacations. Hands down I'd take Piper Nielson from \"Las Vegas\" with me anywhere. She has such a zest for life and would be game for anything. On the flip side, I probably wouldn't want to travel with a wanted criminal! So I'd have to say I'd leave La Fiera from \"The Rookie\" home.\n\nQ: Do you have any upcoming trips planned?\n\nA: We're heading to London to visit my husband's family. Normally we take a little adventure to Henley-on-Thames. It's magical along the Thames River. We spend afternoons on a boat or play with the chickens in the garden. The center of town, Marlow, feels like a storybook. I could spend days there.\n\nQ: What is your favorite vacation destination?\n\nA: I traveled throughout Italy one year and ended up in Gran Sasso d'Italia, mountain group, in the Abruzzo region. We rented a car and drove until we saw something we liked. We grilled meat on a stick above an open fire pit, hiked through the hillside with sheep and cows. It's the unexpectedness for me. If I can immerse myself in the culture, people and good food, then I'm in heaven.\n\nQ: What's the most important thing you've learned from your travels?\n\nA: Life feels different when you're on vacation. It slows down. You look up more than down, you taste new foods, take in new scenery and veer away from your norm. The trick is to sustain that bliss when you get back home. It's easy to slip back to our old ways, but it's braver to make the change.\n\nQ: What are your five favorite cities?\n\nA: Abruzzo, Barcelona, Tokyo, Paris, Bali.\n\nQ: Where would you like to go that you have never been to before?\n\nA: Switzerland in the summer. It looks so magical.\n\nQ: When you go away, what are some of your must-have items?\n\nA: A great pair of sneakers, a pair of pants or jeans that can transition from day to night, the hair dryer brush, good shampoo, conditioner and a moisturizing cream.\n\nQ: What is your guilty pleasure when you're on the road?\n\nA: Vintage shopping. I love finding a beautiful piece of jewelry or a unique piece of art. They symbolize wonderful memories that I'll cherish forever.\n\nQ: What kind of research do you do before you go away on a trip?\n\nA: What do I not do? I love to research so when I get there, I can just let go of it all. Places to eat and where to stay are my top searches. I hate to waste a meal at a bad place when on holiday. So finding a few key places to dine is essential. But also, one of my most favorite memories was in Paris, finding a cheese shop, grabbing our favorite fromage, a baguette, fresh fruit and a bottle of wine.\n\n(Jae-Ha Kim is a New York Times bestselling author and journalist.

Abrams so I can tick that off my bucket list. I let out the biggest scream when I found out I booked the role. I think my husband thought I fell off the roof. I really hope people like it. It's funny, dark and a bit quirky. We filmed season one in Albuquerque. It didn't take long before I immersed myself in the culture. Albuquerque is a slow burn. The food scene is great and very underrated. The mountain views, clouds and sunsets are so picturesque. It's no wonder so many artists paint the most magical colorful sky.\n\nQ: Of all the characters you've played throughout your career, which one would make a great or horrible travel companion?\n\nA: My favorite travel buddies are those with an adventurous spirit and those who say yes! A loose, go with the flow vibe always turns into my favorite vacations. Hands down I'd take Piper Nielson from \"Las Vegas\" with me anywhere. She has such a zest for life and would be game for anything. On the flip side, I probably wouldn't want to travel with a wanted criminal! So I'd have to say I'd leave La Fiera from \"The Rookie\" home.\n\nQ: Do you have any upcoming trips planned?\n\nA: We're heading to London to visit my husband's family. Normally we take a little adventure to Henley-on-Thames. It's magical along the Thames River. We spend afternoons on a boat or play with the chickens in the garden. The center of town, Marlow, feels like a storybook. I could spend days there.\n\nQ: What is your favorite vacation destination?\n\nA: I traveled throughout Italy one year and ended up in Gran Sasso d'Italia, mountain group, in the Abruzzo region. We rented a car and drove until we saw something we liked. We grilled meat on a stick above an open fire pit, hiked through the hillside with sheep and cows. It's the unexpectedness for me. If I can immerse myself in the culture, people and good food, then I'm in heaven.\n\nQ: What's the most important thing you've learned from your travels?\n\nA: Life feels different when you're on vacation. It slows down. You look up more than down, you taste new foods, take in new scenery and veer away from your norm. The trick is to sustain that bliss when you get back home. It's easy to slip back to our old ways, but it's braver to make the change.\n\nQ: What are your five favorite cities?\n\nA: Abruzzo, Barcelona, Tokyo, Paris, Bali.\n\nQ: Where would you like to go that you have never been to before?\n\nA: Switzerland in the summer. It looks so magical.\n\nQ: When you go away, what are some of your must-have items?\n\nA: A great pair of sneakers, a pair of pants or jeans that can transition from day to night, the hair dryer brush, good shampoo, conditioner and a moisturizing cream.\n\nQ: What is your guilty pleasure when you're on the road?\n\nA: Vintage shopping. I love finding a beautiful piece of jewelry or a unique piece of art. They symbolize wonderful memories that I'll cherish forever.\n\nQ: What kind of research do you do before you go away on a trip?\n\nA: What do I not do? I love to research so when I get there, I can just let go of it all. Places to eat and where to stay are my top searches. I hate to waste a meal at a bad place when on holiday. So finding a few key places to dine is essential. But also, one of my most favorite memories was in Paris, finding a cheese shop, grabbing our favorite fromage, a baguette, fresh fruit and a bottle of wine.\n\n(Jae-Ha Kim is a New York Times bestselling author and journalist.

Camille Guaty", "body": "\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" actor Camille Guaty said going with the flow in a new country makes for the best adventures. (Braden Moran)\n\nJae-Ha Kim, Tribune Content Agency\n\n\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" star Camille Guaty said that being cast as Junior Detective Silva in the film was serendipitous. \"Becoming a mom was a really hard journey and I find it so magical that one of my first jobs as a mom was [this film],\" the actress said from her Nashville home. \"It has become one of my son's favorite books. We read it at least five times a week. Every time he sees the policeman in the book, he says, 'Mommy, that's you!' To be able to share this experience with him is one I'll never forget.\" Guaty is active on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/camilleguaty/) and invites her fans to stay in touch with her there.\n\nQ: Where did you film \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\"?\n\nA: \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" was shot in Atlanta, and I absolutely loved it there! I've lived in Atlanta while shooting other movies and TV shows, so the familiarity was nice. The food is incredible. I'll always talk to the locals, find a few favorite spots and hit those toward the end of the shoot. [One of] my favorite things about Atlanta is the music and art scene. You can be walking down the street on a Saturday afternoon and find a random piano sitting there waiting for someone to play it. And, boy, do they. I've seen crowds gather as people take turns playing their favorite tunes ... onlookers start dancing! It's pretty incredible. They definitely know how to embrace life over there.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Camille Guaty", "body": "\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" actor Camille Guaty said going with the flow in a new country makes for the best adventures. (Braden Moran)\n\nJae-Ha Kim, Tribune Content Agency\n\n\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" star Camille Guaty said that being cast as Junior Detective Silva in the film was serendipitous. \"Becoming a mom was a really hard journey and I find it so magical that one of my first jobs as a mom was [this film],\" the actress said from her Nashville home. \"It has become one of my son's favorite books. We read it at least five times a week. Every time he sees the policeman in the book, he says, 'Mommy, that's you!' To be able to share this experience with him is one I'll never forget.\" Guaty is active on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/camilleguaty/) and invites her fans to stay in touch with her there.\n\nQ: Where did you film \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\"?\n\nA: \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" was shot in Atlanta, and I absolutely loved it there! I've lived in Atlanta while shooting other movies and TV shows, so the familiarity was nice. The food is incredible. I'll always talk to the locals, find a few favorite spots and hit those toward the end of the shoot. [One of] my favorite things about Atlanta is the music and art scene. You can be walking down the street on a Saturday afternoon and find a random piano sitting there waiting for someone to play it. And, boy, do they. I've seen crowds gather as people take turns playing their favorite tunes ... onlookers start dancing! It's pretty incredible. They definitely know how to embrace life over there.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Abrams so I can tick that off my bucket list. I let out the biggest scream when I found out I booked the role. I think my husband thought I fell off the roof. I really hope people like it. It's funny, dark and a bit quirky. We filmed season one in Albuquerque. It didn't take long before I immersed myself in the culture. Albuquerque is a slow burn. The food scene is great and very underrated. The mountain views, clouds and sunsets are so picturesque. It's no wonder so many artists paint the most magical colorful sky.\n\nQ: Of all the characters you've played throughout your career, which one would make a great or horrible travel companion?\n\nA: My favorite travel buddies are those with an adventurous spirit and those who say yes! A loose, go with the flow vibe always turns into my favorite vacations. Hands down I'd take Piper Nielson from \"Las Vegas\" with me anywhere. She has such a zest for life and would be game for anything. On the flip side, I probably wouldn't want to travel with a wanted criminal! So I'd have to say I'd leave La Fiera from \"The Rookie\" home.\n\nQ: Do you have any upcoming trips planned?\n\nA: We're heading to London to visit my husband's family. Normally we take a little adventure to Henley-on-Thames. It's magical along the Thames River. We spend afternoons on a boat or play with the chickens in the garden. The center of town, Marlow, feels like a storybook. I could spend days there.\n\nQ: What is your favorite vacation destination?\n\nA: I traveled throughout Italy one year and ended up in Gran Sasso d'Italia, mountain group, in the Abruzzo region. We rented a car and drove until we saw something we liked. We grilled meat on a stick above an open fire pit, hiked through the hillside with sheep and cows. It's the unexpectedness for me. If I can immerse myself in the culture, people and good food, then I'm in heaven.\n\nQ: What's the most important thing you've learned from your travels?\n\nA: Life feels different when you're on vacation. It slows down. You look up more than down, you taste new foods, take in new scenery and veer away from your norm. The trick is to sustain that bliss when you get back home. It's easy to slip back to our old ways, but it's braver to make the change.\n\nQ: What are your five favorite cities?\n\nA: Abruzzo, Barcelona, Tokyo, Paris, Bali.\n\nQ: Where would you like to go that you have never been to before?\n\nA: Switzerland in the summer. It looks so magical.\n\nQ: When you go away, what are some of your must-have items?\n\nA: A great pair of sneakers, a pair of pants or jeans that can transition from day to night, the hair dryer brush, good shampoo, conditioner and a moisturizing cream.\n\nQ: What is your guilty pleasure when you're on the road?\n\nA: Vintage shopping. I love finding a beautiful piece of jewelry or a unique piece of art. They symbolize wonderful memories that I'll cherish forever.\n\nQ: What kind of research do you do before you go away on a trip?\n\nA: What do I not do? I love to research so when I get there, I can just let go of it all. Places to eat and where to stay are my top searches. I hate to waste a meal at a bad place when on holiday. So finding a few key places to dine is essential. But also, one of my most favorite memories was in Paris, finding a cheese shop, grabbing our favorite fromage, a baguette, fresh fruit and a bottle of wine.\n\n(Jae-Ha Kim is a New York Times bestselling author and journalist.

Camille Guaty", "body": "\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" actor Camille Guaty said going with the flow in a new country makes for the best adventures. (Braden Moran)\n\nJae-Ha Kim, Tribune Content Agency\n\n\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" star Camille Guaty said that being cast as Junior Detective Silva in the film was serendipitous. \"Becoming a mom was a really hard journey and I find it so magical that one of my first jobs as a mom was [this film],\" the actress said from her Nashville home. \"It has become one of my son's favorite books. We read it at least five times a week. Every time he sees the policeman in the book, he says, 'Mommy, that's you!' To be able to share this experience with him is one I'll never forget.\" Guaty is active on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/camilleguaty/) and invites her fans to stay in touch with her there.\n\nQ: Where did you film \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\"?\n\nA: \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" was shot in Atlanta, and I absolutely loved it there! I've lived in Atlanta while shooting other movies and TV shows, so the familiarity was nice. The food is incredible. I'll always talk to the locals, find a few favorite spots and hit those toward the end of the shoot. [One of] my favorite things about Atlanta is the music and art scene. You can be walking down the street on a Saturday afternoon and find a random piano sitting there waiting for someone to play it. And, boy, do they. I've seen crowds gather as people take turns playing their favorite tunes ... onlookers start dancing! It's pretty incredible. They definitely know how to embrace life over there.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Abrams so I can tick that off my bucket list. I let out the biggest scream when I found out I booked the role. I think my husband thought I fell off the roof. I really hope people like it. It's funny, dark and a bit quirky. We filmed season one in Albuquerque. It didn't take long before I immersed myself in the culture. Albuquerque is a slow burn. The food scene is great and very underrated. The mountain views, clouds and sunsets are so picturesque. It's no wonder so many artists paint the most magical colorful sky.\n\nQ: Of all the characters you've played throughout your career, which one would make a great or horrible travel companion?\n\nA: My favorite travel buddies are those with an adventurous spirit and those who say yes! A loose, go with the flow vibe always turns into my favorite vacations. Hands down I'd take Piper Nielson from \"Las Vegas\" with me anywhere. She has such a zest for life and would be game for anything. On the flip side, I probably wouldn't want to travel with a wanted criminal! So I'd have to say I'd leave La Fiera from \"The Rookie\" home.\n\nQ: Do you have any upcoming trips planned?\n\nA: We're heading to London to visit my husband's family. Normally we take a little adventure to Henley-on-Thames. It's magical along the Thames River. We spend afternoons on a boat or play with the chickens in the garden. The center of town, Marlow, feels like a storybook. I could spend days there.\n\nQ: What is your favorite vacation destination?\n\nA: I traveled throughout Italy one year and ended up in Gran Sasso d'Italia, mountain group, in the Abruzzo region. We rented a car and drove until we saw something we liked. We grilled meat on a stick above an open fire pit, hiked through the hillside with sheep and cows. It's the unexpectedness for me. If I can immerse myself in the culture, people and good food, then I'm in heaven.\n\nQ: What's the most important thing you've learned from your travels?\n\nA: Life feels different when you're on vacation. It slows down. You look up more than down, you taste new foods, take in new scenery and veer away from your norm. The trick is to sustain that bliss when you get back home. It's easy to slip back to our old ways, but it's braver to make the change.\n\nQ: What are your five favorite cities?\n\nA: Abruzzo, Barcelona, Tokyo, Paris, Bali.\n\nQ: Where would you like to go that you have never been to before?\n\nA: Switzerland in the summer. It looks so magical.\n\nQ: When you go away, what are some of your must-have items?\n\nA: A great pair of sneakers, a pair of pants or jeans that can transition from day to night, the hair dryer brush, good shampoo, conditioner and a moisturizing cream.\n\nQ: What is your guilty pleasure when you're on the road?\n\nA: Vintage shopping. I love finding a beautiful piece of jewelry or a unique piece of art. They symbolize wonderful memories that I'll cherish forever.\n\nQ: What kind of research do you do before you go away on a trip?\n\nA: What do I not do? I love to research so when I get there, I can just let go of it all. Places to eat and where to stay are my top searches. I hate to waste a meal at a bad place when on holiday. So finding a few key places to dine is essential. But also, one of my most favorite memories was in Paris, finding a cheese shop, grabbing our favorite fromage, a baguette, fresh fruit and a bottle of wine.\n\n(Jae-Ha Kim is a New York Times bestselling author and journalist.

Camille Guaty", "body": "\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" actor Camille Guaty said going with the flow in a new country makes for the best adventures. (Braden Moran)\n\nJae-Ha Kim, Tribune Content Agency\n\n\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" star Camille Guaty said that being cast as Junior Detective Silva in the film was serendipitous. \"Becoming a mom was a really hard journey and I find it so magical that one of my first jobs as a mom was [this film],\" the actress said from her Nashville home. \"It has become one of my son's favorite books. We read it at least five times a week. Every time he sees the policeman in the book, he says, 'Mommy, that's you!' To be able to share this experience with him is one I'll never forget.\" Guaty is active on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/camilleguaty/) and invites her fans to stay in touch with her there.\n\nQ: Where did you film \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\"?\n\nA: \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" was shot in Atlanta, and I absolutely loved it there! I've lived in Atlanta while shooting other movies and TV shows, so the familiarity was nice. The food is incredible. I'll always talk to the locals, find a few favorite spots and hit those toward the end of the shoot. [One of] my favorite things about Atlanta is the music and art scene. You can be walking down the street on a Saturday afternoon and find a random piano sitting there waiting for someone to play it. And, boy, do they. I've seen crowds gather as people take turns playing their favorite tunes ... onlookers start dancing! It's pretty incredible. They definitely know how to embrace life over there.\n\nPeople are also reading... Should Iredell invest $60 million in Troutman fairgrounds?

Abrams so I can tick that off my bucket list. I let out the biggest scream when I found out I booked the role. I think my husband thought I fell off the roof. I really hope people like it. It's funny, dark and a bit quirky. We filmed season one in Albuquerque. It didn't take long before I immersed myself in the culture. Albuquerque is a slow burn. The food scene is great and very underrated. The mountain views, clouds and sunsets are so picturesque. It's no wonder so many artists paint the most magical colorful sky.\n\nQ: Of all the characters you've played throughout your career, which one would make a great or horrible travel companion?\n\nA: My favorite travel buddies are those with an adventurous spirit and those who say yes! A loose, go with the flow vibe always turns into my favorite vacations. Hands down I'd take Piper Nielson from \"Las Vegas\" with me anywhere. She has such a zest for life and would be game for anything. On the flip side, I probably wouldn't want to travel with a wanted criminal! So I'd have to say I'd leave La Fiera from \"The Rookie\" home.\n\nQ: Do you have any upcoming trips planned?\n\nA: We're heading to London to visit my husband's family. Normally we take a little adventure to Henley-on-Thames. It's magical along the Thames River. We spend afternoons on a boat or play with the chickens in the garden. The center of town, Marlow, feels like a storybook. I could spend days there.\n\nQ: What is your favorite vacation destination?\n\nA: I traveled throughout Italy one year and ended up in Gran Sasso d'Italia, mountain group, in the Abruzzo region. We rented a car and drove until we saw something we liked. We grilled meat on a stick above an open fire pit, hiked through the hillside with sheep and cows. It's the unexpectedness for me. If I can immerse myself in the culture, people and good food, then I'm in heaven.\n\nQ: What's the most important thing you've learned from your travels?\n\nA: Life feels different when you're on vacation. It slows down. You look up more than down, you taste new foods, take in new scenery and veer away from your norm. The trick is to sustain that bliss when you get back home. It's easy to slip back to our old ways, but it's braver to make the change.\n\nQ: What are your five favorite cities?\n\nA: Abruzzo, Barcelona, Tokyo, Paris, Bali.\n\nQ: Where would you like to go that you have never been to before?\n\nA: Switzerland in the summer. It looks so magical.\n\nQ: When you go away, what are some of your must-have items?\n\nA: A great pair of sneakers, a pair of pants or jeans that can transition from day to night, the hair dryer brush, good shampoo, conditioner and a moisturizing cream.\n\nQ: What is your guilty pleasure when you're on the road?\n\nA: Vintage shopping. I love finding a beautiful piece of jewelry or a unique piece of art. They symbolize wonderful memories that I'll cherish forever.\n\nQ: What kind of research do you do before you go away on a trip?\n\nA: What do I not do? I love to research so when I get there, I can just let go of it all. Places to eat and where to stay are my top searches. I hate to waste a meal at a bad place when on holiday. So finding a few key places to dine is essential. But also, one of my most favorite memories was in Paris, finding a cheese shop, grabbing our favorite fromage, a baguette, fresh fruit and a bottle of wine.\n\n(Jae-Ha Kim is a New York Times bestselling author and journalist.

Camille Guaty", "body": "\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" actor Camille Guaty said going with the flow in a new country makes for the best adventures. (Braden Moran)\n\nJae-Ha Kim, Tribune Content Agency\n\n\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" star Camille Guaty said that being cast as Junior Detective Silva in the film was serendipitous. \"Becoming a mom was a really hard journey and I find it so magical that one of my first jobs as a mom was [this film],\" the actress said from her Nashville home. \"It has become one of my son's favorite books. We read it at least five times a week. Every time he sees the policeman in the book, he says, 'Mommy, that's you!' To be able to share this experience with him is one I'll never forget.\" Guaty is active on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/camilleguaty/) and invites her fans to stay in touch with her there.\n\nQ: Where did you film \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\"?\n\nA: \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" was shot in Atlanta, and I absolutely loved it there! I've lived in Atlanta while shooting other movies and TV shows, so the familiarity was nice. The food is incredible. I'll always talk to the locals, find a few favorite spots and hit those toward the end of the shoot. [One of] my favorite things about Atlanta is the music and art scene. You can be walking down the street on a Saturday afternoon and find a random piano sitting there waiting for someone to play it. And, boy, do they. I've seen crowds gather as people take turns playing their favorite tunes ... onlookers start dancing! It's pretty incredible. They definitely know how to embrace life over there.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Abrams so I can tick that off my bucket list. I let out the biggest scream when I found out I booked the role. I think my husband thought I fell off the roof. I really hope people like it. It's funny, dark and a bit quirky. We filmed season one in Albuquerque. It didn't take long before I immersed myself in the culture. Albuquerque is a slow burn. The food scene is great and very underrated. The mountain views, clouds and sunsets are so picturesque. It's no wonder so many artists paint the most magical colorful sky.\n\nQ: Of all the characters you've played throughout your career, which one would make a great or horrible travel companion?\n\nA: My favorite travel buddies are those with an adventurous spirit and those who say yes! A loose, go with the flow vibe always turns into my favorite vacations. Hands down I'd take Piper Nielson from \"Las Vegas\" with me anywhere. She has such a zest for life and would be game for anything. On the flip side, I probably wouldn't want to travel with a wanted criminal! So I'd have to say I'd leave La Fiera from \"The Rookie\" home.\n\nQ: Do you have any upcoming trips planned?\n\nA: We're heading to London to visit my husband's family. Normally we take a little adventure to Henley-on-Thames. It's magical along the Thames River. We spend afternoons on a boat or play with the chickens in the garden. The center of town, Marlow, feels like a storybook. I could spend days there.\n\nQ: What is your favorite vacation destination?\n\nA: I traveled throughout Italy one year and ended up in Gran Sasso d'Italia, mountain group, in the Abruzzo region. We rented a car and drove until we saw something we liked. We grilled meat on a stick above an open fire pit, hiked through the hillside with sheep and cows. It's the unexpectedness for me. If I can immerse myself in the culture, people and good food, then I'm in heaven.\n\nQ: What's the most important thing you've learned from your travels?\n\nA: Life feels different when you're on vacation. It slows down. You look up more than down, you taste new foods, take in new scenery and veer away from your norm. The trick is to sustain that bliss when you get back home. It's easy to slip back to our old ways, but it's braver to make the change.\n\nQ: What are your five favorite cities?\n\nA: Abruzzo, Barcelona, Tokyo, Paris, Bali.\n\nQ: Where would you like to go that you have never been to before?\n\nA: Switzerland in the summer. It looks so magical.\n\nQ: When you go away, what are some of your must-have items?\n\nA: A great pair of sneakers, a pair of pants or jeans that can transition from day to night, the hair dryer brush, good shampoo, conditioner and a moisturizing cream.\n\nQ: What is your guilty pleasure when you're on the road?\n\nA: Vintage shopping. I love finding a beautiful piece of jewelry or a unique piece of art. They symbolize wonderful memories that I'll cherish forever.\n\nQ: What kind of research do you do before you go away on a trip?\n\nA: What do I not do? I love to research so when I get there, I can just let go of it all. Places to eat and where to stay are my top searches. I hate to waste a meal at a bad place when on holiday. So finding a few key places to dine is essential. But also, one of my most favorite memories was in Paris, finding a cheese shop, grabbing our favorite fromage, a baguette, fresh fruit and a bottle of wine.\n\n(Jae-Ha Kim is a New York Times bestselling author and journalist.

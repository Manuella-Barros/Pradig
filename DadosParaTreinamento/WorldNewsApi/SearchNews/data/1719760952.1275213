The third phase of the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, also known as the \u201cBig Fund\u201d, was established last week with a registered capital of 344 billion yuan (US$47.5 billion) as part of the country\u2019s efforts to build a self-sufficient semiconductor sector. The fund is aimed at enhancing the nation\u2019s \u201cability to supply [semiconductors] internally\u201d, reinforcing Beijing\u2019s goal to \u201cbuild up the capability and strengths\u201d of this industry, despite mounting US tech sanctions, Randy Abrams, the head of Taiwan research at Swiss investment bank UBS, said on Wednesday. While mainland chip foundries such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp and Hua Hong Semiconductor are expected to benefit from the latest funding resource, Abrams said: \u201cThere will be some [investments] on capacity, equipment and materials, as well as investments tied to advanced packaging.\u201d The size of the new fund \u2013 roughly on par with the US$53 billion in incentives under the Chips and Science Act, which was enacted by US President Joe Biden in 2022 \u2013 reflects the massive backing from state-owned enterprises and Beijing\u2019s \u201cwhole nation\u201d approach to building a self-sufficient semiconductor industry amid Washington\u2019s tech export restrictions. Big Fund III has 19 equity investors, led by China\u2019s Ministry of Finance. Other stakeholders include China Development Bank Capital, Shanghai Guosheng Group, China Construction Bank, Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Postal Savings Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and China National Tobacco Corp. The new fund will be managed by Zhang Xin, an official at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which is the principal agency overseeing China\u2019s semiconductor industry. Zhang had replaced Ding Wenwu to oversee the Big Fund after the latter was put under investigation for possible corruption in July 2022. Launched in 2014, the Big Fund had raised 204.1 billion yuan in 2019, up from its initial financing of 138.7 billion yuan. These two funding rounds highlighted investments in chip manufacturing, with about 16 per cent earmarked in the first phase and 50 per cent in the second phase, according to calculations made by the South China Morning Post based on data from Qichacha. In spite of corruption scandals, the Big Fund has been successful in fostering the development of key domestic enterprises, including memory chip giant Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp and top DRAM producer ChangXin Memory Technologies. Apart from chip makers, Big Fund III is also expected to provide more support for equipment suppliers like Naura Technology Group and Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment, as well as raw material providers such as National Silicon Industry Group, according to analysts. But the jury is still out on whether China can overcome US tech restrictions, which have created \u201cchoking points\u201d in the domestic semiconductor industry. \u201cIt\u2019s very challenging to see the gap narrowing because of export controls, which make it very difficult to get the right [chip-making] equipment to operate at the right production yields and cost,\u201d Nicolas Gaudois, UBS head of Asia-Pacific technology research, said.", "summary": "Apart from domestic semiconductor manufacturers, the third phase of China\u2019s \u2018Big Fund\u2019 is expected to support chip equipment and material suppliers, analysts said.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3264612/tech-war-chinas-big-fund-iii-brings-us475-billion-fresh-outlay-nations-semiconductor-supply-chain", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/29/7ec756e4-5c3c-44fa-b97a-d578b2850453_a33bafd8.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:31:59", "author": "Che Pan,Xinmei Shen", "authors": ["Che Pan", "Xinmei Shen"], "language": "en", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": -0.333}

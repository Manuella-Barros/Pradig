(AP) \u2014 The Coral Gables Art Cinema will be short more than $100,000 this year. About $150,000 has suddenly disappeared from the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra\u2019s budget. The Miami New Drama also has an unexpected $150,000 budget hole. Across Florida, arts groups are scrambling after Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis unexpectedly vetoed $32 million in arts funding on June 12, eliminating all state grants for those organizations in a move that advocates say will devastate arts and culture in the Sunshine State. \u201cWhat baffles me is that Florida has been trying to attract business from New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and what message are we sending if we cut funding to our cultural organizations?\u201d said Michel Hausmann, artistic director and co-founder of the Miami New Drama in Miami Beach. \u201cAre you going to attract people to a state where arts and culture aren\u2019t valued? They are the lifeline of a city.\u201d Arts leaders across the state say it\u2019s the first time they recall a Florida governor eliminating all grant funding for arts and culture, and it comes as arts organizations that survived COVID-19 pandemic closures are still recovering with smaller attendance and revenues. For the more than 600 arts groups and facilities that were up for state grants, DeSantis\u2019 veto was a surprise because the Legislature had approved arts funding, though what lawmakers approved was less than half of what was initially recommended by the state Division of Arts and Culture. Florida arts organizations had planned their budgets accordingly. When asked at a news conference on Thursday why he vetoed arts funding in the state\u2019s $116.5 billion budget, DeSantis said some of the money was slotted for programming that many taxpayers would find objectionable because of its sexual nature or for other reasons. \u201cWhen I see money being spent that way, I have to be the one to stand up for taxpayers and say, \u2018You know what, that is an inappropriate use of taxpayer dollars,\u2019\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cI think the Legislature needs to reevaluate how that\u2019s being done.\u201d Most arts groups are still assessing the impact, but some may have to cut programming or staff. \u201cWe are appealing to the community to help cover part of the budget deficit and we are exploring other funding opportunities in the private sector,\u201d said Brenda Moe, executive director of Coral Gables Art Cinema. \u201cWe must get creative to plug this hole.\u201d The Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra will trim expenses, look for a way to increase revenue and hope county and city officials fill some of the gap, said Karina Bharne, the symphony\u2019s executive director. State grants made up 10% of the Coral Gables Art Cinema\u2019s budget, more than 3% of the Miami New Drama\u2019s budget and around 2% of the Orlando Philharmonic\u2019s budget. PEN America, the free-speech nonprofit, likened the arts funding cuts to legislative priorities pushed by the DeSantis administration, such as laws limiting what can be said in classrooms about sexual orientation and gender identity and prohibiting the teaching of an academic framework outlining the ways systemic racism is part of American society. \u201dDeSantis is taking his war on culture to a new level,\u201d said Katie Blankenship, director of PEN America\u2019s Florida office. \u201cThis decision will not only devastate the arts but add to his legacy of censorship and disregard for art, literature, and knowledge.\u201d State grants are important to Florida arts groups not only because of their monetary size but because they can be used for salaries, rent, insurance and utilities. Often, private donors make gifts with strings attached for certain programs or performances. Ticket sales cover as little as a third of some arts groups\u2019 budgets. \u201cIt hurts us dramatically in our ability to pay rent and pay salaries,\u201d said Robert Kesten, executive director of the Stonewall National Museum Archives & Library in Fort Lauderdale, which had been expecting $42,300 from the state this year. To overcome shortfalls, arts groups may have to explore alternative fundraising strategies, such as tapping new Florida residents who haven\u2019t donated before, or collaborate with each other by sharing staff, spaces, costumes or sets, said Jennifer Evins, president and CEO of United Arts of Central Florida in Orlando. Florida\u2019s arts and cultural industry generates $5.7 billion in economic activity a year, including $2.9 billion by nonprofit arts and culture organizations, and supports more than 91,000 full-time jobs, according to a study from Americans for the Arts in collaboration with the state Division of Arts and Culture and Citizens for Florida Arts Inc. \u201cWe make a huge impact on the quality of life. We make the state more appealing, and we don\u2019t cost money,\u201d Hausmann said. \u201cThere\u2019s no justification for this cut unless it\u2019s trying to make a political statement. It\u2019s not an economic one.\u201d ___ Associated Press reporters Cody Jackson in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Curt Anderson in St. Petersburg, Florida, contributed to this report. ___ Follow Mike Schneider on the social platform X: @MikeSchneiderAP.

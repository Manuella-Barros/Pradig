Before teeing off at Greystone Golf & Country Club, DeBoer spoke to reporters on the driving range. Below is a transcript of everything he said.\n\nDeBoer's opening statement...\n\n\"It's just great to be here. What an event. My first time here, so just really looking forward to spending some time. I'm not sure about the golf game piece, but just seeing all the fans and seeing everyone that supports our program. Looking forward to a great day.\"\n\nDeBoer on why it was important to be here in his first year...\n\n\"I think just being out in the community. There's great causes that everything supports. So just being out here and signing autographs and seeing the excitement, it continues to motivate you. I think you've gotta be driven in the first place, but seeing everyone out here and the excitement for this fall, it's a lot of fun to be a part of.\"\n\nDeBoer on how the transfer portal has treated Alabama...\n\n\"I think it's been really good. I feel like we will improve our roster when it's all said and done. There wasn't a lot of spots left for us to be able to bring some players in, so we've had to be real choosy. As guys have entered, we've continued to tweak and adjust our plan. But I think we're right where we want to be and getting close to finalizing these last couple spots on the team.\"\n\nDeBoer on the center position after James Brockermeyer's departure...\n\n\"Every player's got their reasons for wanting to kind of test the waters and check things out. So I appreciate talking more about our guys on our team, but we always will have nothing but respect for him and the efforts he's put into our program, just like every other player who poured all they have into it. I think we'll have some guys within our team that can bridge that gap that is left, and I think we'll be just fine.\"\n\nDeBoer on if he expects Parker Brailsford to be with the team this summer...\n\n\"Yeah, absolutely. Yep, absolutely. No question.\"\n\nDeBoer on how he feels about his golf game, dream golf partner...\n\n\"Well, that would be Tiger Woods. He's just so captivating when it comes to the golf game. But this could be interesting out here. The one thing I know is that the fans will never be worried about me playing too much golf and focusing on football after they watch what happens today.\"\n\nDeBoer on where he wants to see Jalen Milroe improve this summer...\n\n\"He really came a long ways in processing, playing the game, moving the chains. And so just when he hits fall camp, I think just having 100 percent confidence in every concept we put in, especially in the first week or two that he's had rep after rep after rep and can not just execute but also run the whole show. Just telling every guy what their responsibility is. And so it goes beyond your position, it goes on to leading the rest of the offense.\"\n\nDeBoer on if there is more clarity on Jalen Hale's recovery from injury...\n\n\"This season will certainly be a tough one, but I don't wanna also say that he would be out the entire year. Also, it depends on how long the season goes. He's done an amazing job, and the process and recovery for him has been sped up just even since the injury happened back in the spring. He's got an amazing mindset about him, and because of that, that's why he's having that progress at such a fast pace.\"\n\nDeBoer on what flavor milkshake will he celebrate with after he wins today...\n\n\"I'm sure I'm gonna have plenty of time to figure that one out here in the years to come. So I'm not sure, I'm not sure.\"\n\nHave you subscribed to BamaOnLine.com yet? You can sign up for ONE MONTH of premium access to our Alabama coverage for just $11.99!

Usually, everyone is watching the Crimson Tide because they were consistently one of the best teams in college football with Nick Saban leading the charge. Now, Saban is gone, and everyone is wondering if new head coach Kalen DeBoer can keep Alabama in dynasty mode.\n\nIt's going to be interesting to see someone else leading the Alabama football team, but Kalen DeBoer is as capable as they come.\n\nOne position group to watch in the 2024 season for the Crimson Tide is the wide receivers. DeBoer just had his top WR from Washington, Rome Odunze, drafted early in the first round of the NFL Draft, and another receiver like him would sure help the cause at Alabama.\n\n\"I think we're still establishing that,\" DeBoer said in regards to the receivers, according to an article from On3. \"You saw the spring game. I think Germie Bernard has some special skills. I think you go on down the line, all those guys are doing their thing, and making plays.\"\n\nAlabama will be returning their starting quarterback, Jalen Milroe, from last season, and that will be huge for their success. However, there are some slight question marks surrounding Milroe as well. He was a huge threat with his legs last year, but it will interesting to see how far he progresses as a thrower this offseason. His connection with his WRs will play a big role in that progression.\n\n\"A lot of these guys, timing with the quarterbacks,\" DeBoer said. \"We've been rotating receivers with the ones and the twos for the most part, guys that would be in the mix. And then also, not every drive has been Milroe because you need to get those other guys action. So, you bump guys up... The timing this summer is what they got to work on.\"\n\nTalent shouldn't be an issue for Alabama football\n\nAlabama football does have the talent to have a very explosive offense in 2024. The playmakers are there, but it will come down to how the offense gels together and if those players are put into the right positions to make plays. Kalen DeBoer knows that the talent is there.\n\n\"I think we do have multiple guys that can do a lot of special things for us on the football field,\" DeBoer added.\n\nThis is definitely one of the most intriguing Alabama teams in a long time because of their coaching change. There hasn't been a question in regards to how good the Crimson Tide will be in a long time, but now it's fair to wonder.\n\nThe College Football Playoff expansion is huge for DeBoer and the Crimson Tide this season. That relieves the pressure a little bit on everybody as we saw last year that one loss, or zero losses in some cases, can knock you out of playoff contention. Now, you can afford to drop two or three games and still make it into the playoff. Still, it won't be easy to get there, and Alabama football fans will not be happy if DeBoer can't find a way to finish in the top 12.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scotty_white@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Scotty White", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalen_DeBoer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kalen DeBoer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Odunze", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rome Odunze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nick Saban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic_Study", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic Study", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/7378520454.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550573", "eventUri": "eng-9550573", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

According to head coach Kalen DeBoer, the Tide pivoted as new players became available. With a few spots left to fill this summer, UA is likely not done finding depth.\n\nYet, the spring window also allowed some talent to leave Tuscaloosa. That included James Brockermeyer, a three-year player who earned starting reps at center through most practices and the spring game. He opted to leave for TCU, returning home as his brother Tommy Brockermeyer did a year ago. Speaking to reporters for the first time since Brockermeyer's commitment on April 29, DeBoer was asked about the departure.\n\n\"Every player's got their reasons for wanting to kind of test the waters and check things out. I appreciate you know, talking more about our guys and our team,\" DeBoer said ahead of his round at the Regions Tradition Celebrity Pro-Am in Birmingham. \"But we always will have nothing but respect for him and, you know, the effort he's put into our program, just like every other player who's poured all they have into it.\"\n\nDeBoer was confident that Alabama has the players to \"bridge that gap\" when the team reconvenes later in the summer. Eyes will turn to Washington transfer Parker Brailsford, who worked with the second team during early spring practices but then stepped away for a yet-to-be-disclosed reason. The former Joe Moore Award winner did not participate in the spring game and DeBoer said he's been working with the team's training staff.\n\nAfter being asked about Brockermeyer, a reporter followed up and asked about Brailsford's status. DeBoer said there would be \"no question\" the redshirt sophomore will be in uniform for the Tide this fall. Other than Brailsford, there are inexperienced pieces behind him. Roq Montgomery and Olaus Alinen are in their second year with the program. The Tide also trained multiple linemen to snap.\n\n\"(Centers) gotta understand the scheme. You gotta be able to communicate great to the guys next to you,\" said offensive line coach Chris Kapilovic in March.\n\nThe Tide has brought in 11 transfers total and eight since DeBoer was hired.

The Crimson Tide saw starting center Seth McLaughlin enter the transfer portal shortly after the season came to an end at the hands of the Michigan Wolverines, leaving a significant hole in the middle of the Alabama offensive line.\n\nNew head coach Kalen DeBoer filled that hole with a familiar face in Washington center Parker Brailsford, however his transition to Tuscaloosa hasn't exactly been smooth. Brailsford transferred from Washington to Alabama in the winter window, but never took part in spring practice as he dealt with a personal issue.\n\nBrailsfords absence opened the door for James Brockermeyer to start at center throughout spring practice. Brockermeyer played well in Alabama's A-Day, but decided to enter the transfer portal and return to his home state and enroll at TCU, once again leaving the Crimson Tide with question marks in the middle.\n\n\"Yeah I mean every player's got their reasons for wanting to kind of test the waters and check things out. I appreciate talking more about our guys on our team, but we'll always have nothing but respect for him [Brockermeyer] and the efforts he's put into our program, just like every other player who's poured all they have into it. I think we'll have some guys within our team that can bridge that gap that is left and I think we'll be just fine,\" said DeBoer on Wednesday.\n\nDeBoer continued to express confidence in Brailsford and his return to the program once the summer exercises begin but also said that there were a few roster spots left to finalize.\n\n\"As guys have entered [the transfer portal portal] we've continued to tweak and adjust our plan, but I think we're right where we want to be in getting close to kind of finalizing these last couple spots on the team,\" said DeBoer.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalen_DeBoer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kalen DeBoer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscaloosa,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tuscaloosa_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Tuscaloosa News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Wolverines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCU_Horned_Frogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TCU Horned Frogs football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Advocacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4756,h_2675,x_0,y_85/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/bama_central/01hxcdsgfvh25adfk9px.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550573", "eventUri": "eng-9550573", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Nicole and Kalen DeBoer hold up an Alabama jersey after the press conference.\n\nBy Nolan Lackey\n\nNick Saban's retirement left many Alabama fans in shock, losing who most consider the greatest College Football Coach of all time. Alabama spent little time finding a coach, hiring former Washington coach Kalen Deboer just over two days after Saban's retirement. The new coaching change leaves many wondering what the future of Alabama football will hold with their first coaching change since 2007.\n\nKalen DeBoers Prior Experience\n\nKalen DeBoer got his first chance as a head coach in 2020 when he was hired at Fresno State. In the shortened season, he led his team to a record of 3-3, and in 2021 an overall record of 10-3, winning the New Mexico Bowl. After transforming the program in just two seasons with the Bulldogs, Deboer was offered the Head Coach position at Washington, which he accepted and was hired on November 29, 2021.\n\nWith the Huskies, DeBoer led his team to an overall record of 11-2 beating Texas in the Alamo Bowl and finishing #8 in the final 2022-2023 AP Poll. He transformed this Washington team who had a 4-8 record in the previous season to their first 11-win season since making the College Football Playoff in 2016. For his work, DeBoer earned the honor of Pac-12 Coach of the Year in his first season in the Conference.\n\nGoing into the 2023-2024 season Washington had high expectations with Michael Penix Jr, Rome Odunze, and Dillon Johnson headlining the team filled with top talents. The Huskies did not disappoint, finishing the regular season with a 12-0 record and winning the PAC-12 Championship. They entered the College Football Playoffs as a #2 seed before coming up just short in the National Championship to a very talented Michigan team.\n\nFor this, DeBoer got lots of National recognition for the way he transformed the Huskies and gathered many accolades. He received Pac-12 Coach of the Year again and added multiple National Coach of the Year honors. At Washington, DeBoer transformed this program into a winning team in just two seasons.\n\nWhat DeBoer's Team Will Look Like at Alabama\n\nDeBoer now steps into the Alabama head coach job, looking to keep their winning ways. Saban's departure caused many top players in Alabama to transfer and more recruits to decommit.\n\nDespite this, DeBoer will still have a loaded Alabama team, led by star QB Jalen Milroe. Milroe led his team to the College Football Playoffs last season losing to Michigan in the semi-finals, and will hope to make it back this season. The standard at Alabama however, is to win the National Championship each season something Kalen DeBoer just missed the year prior with a less-talented team. In addition, DeBoer has yet to experience the intensity and competitiveness of the SEC, widely considered the top college football conference.\n\nDeBoer has produced many NFL players, having 10 players drafted from the past season. Previously mentioned Penix Jr. and Odunze, alongside Troy Fautanu, were all 1st-round picks from this draft. However, all his previous success and accomplishments go out the window for this Alabama program expecting him to produce as soon as he steps on campus. DeBoer will have a tough task in replacing the greatness of Saban, but has the potential to turn into the next great coach of the historically dominant Alabama Crimson Tide.", "source": {"uri":

You know, things can change.

What an event,\" DeBoer said. \"My first time here, so just really looking forward to spending some time. I'm not sure about the golf game piece, but just seeing all the fans and seeing everyone that supports our program. Looking forward to a great day.\"\n\nThe Pro-Am features a stacked list of celebrities, including former Alabama head coach Nick Saban, Georgia head coach Kirby Smart, basketball Hall of Famer Charles Barkley, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, country music star Riley Green, and legendary golfer John Daly.\n\nThe event has been a massive draw for years, and DeBoer is following in the footsteps of Saban, who has played at the Pro-Am for countless years.\n\n\"Just being out here and signing autographs and seeing the excitement, it continues to motivate you,\" DeBoer said. \"I think you've gotta be driven in the first place, but seeing everyone out here and the excitement for this fall, it's a lot of fun to be a part of.\"\n\nDeBoer spoke to the media before his tee-time, and while most of the questions asked were golf-related, he also took time to speak on his team, and on his star quarterback.\n\n\"Every player's got their reasons for wanting to test the waters and check things out,\" DeBoer said on Brockermeyer's departure. \"I appreciate talking more about our guys and our team but we'll always have nothing but respect for him and the effort he's put into our program just like every other player who's poured all they have into it. I think we'll have some guys within out team that can bridge that gap that is left, and I think we'll be just fine.\"\n\n2023 All-Pac-12 Second Teamer Parker Brailsford now appears primed to start at center for Alabama in 2024, and it is very likely that DeBoer looks to bring in another interior offensive lineman in the transfer portal.\n\nAt the end of the day, golf was still the main topic of discussion at the course. DeBoer appeared confident in his golf skills, leaving a message for those who were worried about him playing in the event in his first year as head coach.\n\n\"Fans will never be worried about me playing too much golf and focusing on football after they watch what happens today.\"", "source": {"uri": "wvua23.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WVUA23"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalen_DeBoer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kalen DeBoer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greystone_Golf_&_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greystone Golf & Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Tradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Saban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riley_Green_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riley Green (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Daly_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Daly (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Condoleezza Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby_Smart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kirby Smart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.wvua23.com/content/uploads/2024/05/t/c/pic-kalen-deboer-regions-golf-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550573", "eventUri": "eng-9550573", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Last year's starter, Seth McLaughlin, transferred to Ohio State in January. From there, DeBoer brought over Washington transfer Parker Brailsford, who started at center on the Huskies' Joe Moore Award-winning offensive line last season.\n\nBrailsford then sat out the majority of spring camp due to non-football-related reasons, resulting in redshirt junior James Brockermeyer taking the majority of first-team reps during camp. Last week, Brockermeyer threw another wrench in Alabama's plans, entering the transfer portal before ultimately transferring to TCU.\n\nDuring an appearance at the Regions Tradition at Greystone Golf and Country Club on Wednesday, DeBoer was asked about Brockermeyer's decision to transfer as well as where his team stands at the center position.\n\n\"We'll have nothing but respect for him and the efforts he's put into our program, just like every other player who's poured everything they have into it,\" DeBoer. \"I think we'll have some guys within our team that will bridge that gap that is left, and I think we'll be just fine.\"\n\nThroughout Alabama's spring camp, DeBoer reiterated that Brailsford has \"never done anything wrong\" and is in good standing with the team. When asked Wednesday DeBoer said Brailsford would \"absolutely\" be back with the team when summer workouts begin in June.\n\nDuring his redshirt freshman season last year, Brailsford started all 15 games for Washington, earning second-team All-Pac 12 honors. According to Pro Football Focus, the 6-foot-2, 275-pound lineman recorded an 82.6 pass-blocking grade and an 80.8 run-blocking mark. With Brailsford out this spring, true freshman Joseph Ionata worked as Alabama's second-team center behind Brockermeyer.\n\nAlabama is also in the market to add another interior lineman through the portal, as the Tide has been linked to Michigan State transfer Geno VanDeMark. The 6-foot-5, 325-pound junior played in eight games, including six starts at the right guard position. VanDeMark also started two games at right guard in 2022 but started that year working at center.\n\nAlabama has made three transfer additions this spring, bringing back five-star offensive tackle Kadyn Proctor from Iowa while adding Lou Groza Award-winning kicker Graham Nicholson from Miami-Ohio and safety Kameron Howard from Charlotte.

The latest defection was James Brockermeyer, who ended the spring with the first offensive line.\n\nBut despite the center role being light on experience, and numbers, Alabama head coach Kalen DeBoer is still optimistic about the middle of the Tide line for the 2024 season.\n\n\"Every player's got their reasons for wanting to kind of test the waters and check things out,\" said DeBoer before the Regions Tradition Pro-Am. \"So I appreciate talking more about our guys on our team, but we always will have nothing but respect for him and the efforts he's put into our program, just like every other player who poured all they have into it.\n\n\"I think we'll have some guys within our team that can bridge that gap that is left, and I think we'll be just fine.\"\n\nBrockermeyer, a redshirt junior, capped Alabama's spring season working at center with the first-team offense. After playing in all 14 games last season as a reserve, Brockermeyer was set to compete for the starting job with Washington transfer Parker Brailsford, who missed time this spring due to non-football-related things. Now, Brockermeyer is on the move.\n\nHis departure leaves the Tide thin at the center position. Adding Brailsford shortly after DeBoer took over as the head coach helps, but beyond that, the Tide doesn't have any experience at the offensive line's anchor position after Seth McLaughlin transferred.\n\nRoq Montgomery, Joseph Ionata and William Sanders all saw reps there this spring, but they have played in a combined two games. With that in mind, center could be a spot Alabama looks to fill via the transfer portal. The Tide is interested in Michigan State transfer Geno VanDeMark, who started eight career games at right guard for the Spartans before leaving.\n\nVanDeMark would be the third transfer offensive lineman to join Alabama, along with Brailsford and Kadyn Proctor, who will push to reclaim his spot at left tackle. Brailsford missed the second half of his first spring in Tuscaloosa due to personal reasons, but DeBoer has stayed positive about his future with the team, including when asked on Wednesday.\n\n\"Yeah, absolutely,\" said DeBoer when asked if Brailsford will be back. \"No question.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlie_potter@on3.com", "name": "Charlie Potter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalen_DeBoer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kalen DeBoer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Tradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirt_(college_sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Redshirt (college sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Spartans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State Spartans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Spartans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State Spartans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscaloosa,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/04/11185223/ParkerBrailsfordPractice32124-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550573", "eventUri": "eng-9550573", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Starting with Gene Stallings, every Alabama football coach has played in the event (even Mike Price, who was fired before ever coaching the Crimson Tide in a game). Within a week of being hired in January, the event was put on DeBoer's calendar because it's a \"rite of passage,\" according to the event's executive director Gene Hallman.\n\nInterestingly, the man he replaced was there, too. Nick Saban has played in the event every year except one since taking the Alabama job in 2007 -- his lone absence was last year because of a trip to Italy -- and he made the trek back from his $17.5 million vacation home in Jupiter Island, Fla., to play in an event that also featured Georgia head coach Kirby Smart, Auburn head coach Hugh Freeze and Senator Tommy Tuberville. The event helps benefit local charities including Children's of Alabama.\n\nIn a moment that felt too on the nose to be real, at one point DeBoer literally stood in Nick Saban's shadow as both hit golf balls on the driving range before beginning their rounds. Following in the footsteps of college football's greatest coach will chase DeBoer around all year as he replaces a man who won six national championships during an unprecedented run of success in Tuscaloosa. At least on this day, DeBoer got to play ahead of Saban in the tee times. The two posed for a photo on the range beforehand with Saban wearing his traditional straw hat and DeBoer advertising the program's Name, Image and Likeness collective with a red Yea Alabama polo -- a tiny moment emblematic of the new college football world.\n\nThe presence of Saban was unmistakable even as he eases into retirement. He had three police officers protecting him all day -- DeBoer had two -- and hundreds of fans and autograph seekers followed him around the golf course all day in the humid Alabama weather. As much as you know it to be true, it still catches you off-guard to hear Saban introduced as the \"former head coach of the University of Alabama,\" but even in semi-retirement the new college football television analyst drew the biggest crowd on the course. His adoring fans wanted to thank him for all that he had meant to them over the last 17 years.\n\nCedric Burns, Saban's long-time driver and right-hand man, was dutifully back in his role as autograph gatekeeper as fans pleaded and cajoled to get as many items in Burns' hands for Saban to sign as possible. Burns enforces a one-autograph-per-person rule, trying to get the young kids in attendance autographs before the adults. Everything from helmets to jerseys to books to golf flags eventually made their way to Saban, who was signing autographs seemingly every moment he wasn't hitting a golf ball.\n\nHaving the past and future of Alabama football together led to the largest Pro-Am crowd in more than a decade, according to Hallman, who singled out DeBoer as the single biggest driver of the event's big attendance.\n\n\"I think that the interest in the new coach and the fact that Coach Saban came and they are playing back to back,\" Hallman told CBS Sports. \"I think a lot of people saw an opportunity to get both their autographs and maybe get a photograph of them together.\"\n\nDeBoer acquiesced to every photo request along the way, displaying a charm and understanding of how much it meant to the people in attendance. Kristen Saban, daughter of Nick, came up to him at one point during the round and introduced herself, the pair spending a couple minutes chatting and getting to know each other. DeBoer admitted he isn't much of a golfer -- \"fans will never be worried about me playing too much golf\" -- but wanted to be there to interact with the fans as he builds up goodwill as the program's new leader.\n\nHe exceeded those expectations for the most part, with multiple strong drives off the tee throughout the day. On one hole on the front-nine, however, DeBoer's second shot came dangerously close to hitting some Canadian Geese standing on the course.\n\n\"You killed an Alabama duck!\" a volunteer loudly said.\n\nShe paused for a moment and then added, \"Thank you for coming to Alabama.\"\n\nWhether she was thanking him for almost killing the geese or for taking over the football program was unclear, but DeBoer thanked her back. It was emblematic of the day for the North Dakota native who wasn't overwhelmed by the throng of diehard Alabama fans and handled every moment of the day with aplomb. He doesn't have near the star power of Saban yet, but it was clear on a hot day on the outskirts of Birmingham that an enthusiastic Alabama fanbase wanted to show just how excited it is about its new head coach.\n\nIt is moments like Wednesday that led DeBoer to leave a terrific situation in Washington to replace the greatest of all-time.\n\n\"Seeing the excitement it continues to motivate you,\" DeBoer said. \"I think you have to be driven in the first place but seeing everyone out here and the excitement is a lot of fun.\"\n\nMore: Crimson Tide heating up in transfer portal and not finished

Before teeing off at the Regions Tradition Pro-Am, DeBoer offered the latest on Hale's recovery.\n\n\"This season will certainly be a tough one, but I don't wanna also say that he would be out the entire year,\" said DeBoer at Greystone Golf & Country Club. \"Also, it depends on how long the season goes. He's done an amazing job, and the process and recovery for him has been sped up just even since the injury happened back in the spring.\n\n\"He's got an amazing mindset about him, and because of that, that's why he's having that progress at such a fast pace.\"\n\nHale is entering his second season at Alabama after appearing in 13 of the Crimson Tide's 14 games as a true freshman in 2023. He finished seventh on the team in receiving yards (148) on just five catches and was set to see his role increase with five players at his position moving on from the program. But the injury will keep him out for at least the start of Alabama's first season under DeBoer. However, the coach and player both remain optimistic.\n\nAs he has since the injury occurred, Hale took to social media to share how his recovery from the knee injury is going. On Monday, he posted another positive outlook on his rehab.\n\n\"Blessed to see another day,\" Hale said on X. \"And to all my supporters I'm rehabilitating good - One day at a time - Don't count me out - The return will be Epic - What God has planned nothing can stop it .

However, things are a bit different this offseason.\n\nNick Saban is off to enjoy retirement, while head coach Kalen DeBoer has stepped in as new face of the Crimson Tide's football program. DeBoer has been building a relationship with his QB1 throughout the offseason, and broke down the improvements he still wants to see in Milroe so far during their short time together.\n\n\"He really came a long ways in processing, playing the game, moving the chains,\" DeBoer said. \"And so just when he hits fall camp, I think just having 100 percent confidence in every concept we put in, especially in the first week or two that he's had rep after rep after rep and can not just execute but also run the whole show. Just telling every guy what their responsibility is. And so it goes beyond your position, it goes on to leading the rest of the offense.\"\n\nPresumably Alabama's starting quarterback for the upcoming season, Milroe wasn't featured as much as other quarterbacks during the spring game last month. He finished the game completing 3 of his 9 passes for 100 yards -- including a 52-yard connection to Germie Bernard, who finished the day with three receptions going for 122 yards.\n\nAlthough he wasn't able to find his way into the end zone at last month's A-Day showcase, Milroe's resume speaks for itself. In 2023, his potential was there. Ultimately leading Alabama to a 12-2 overall record and an SEC Championship victory over Georgia, which helped push the Crimson Tide into the College Football Playoff where they eventually fell to eventual national champions Michigan in the Rose Bowl.\n\nLast season, Milroe finished 2,718 yards passing, 23 touchdowns and just six interceptions. He was also a significant threat on the ground, finishing the season with 468 rushing yards and a team-high 12 touchdowns on the ground. That type of dual-threat ability bodes well for DeBoer's fast-paced offense.\n\nWhile the spring game was a great start, the Crimson Tide will officially kick the Kalen DeBoer era off with a Week 1 matchup against the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers on Aug. 31 inside Bryant-Denny Stadium. They'll begin SEC play with a rematch of last year's SEC Championship game against the Bulldogs on Sept. 28 -- a game the entire nation will have its eyes on.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "barkley_truax@on3.com", "name": "Barkley Truax", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalen_DeBoer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kalen DeBoer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Saban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Kentucky_Hilltoppers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Bowl_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rose Bowl (stadium)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Wolverines football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SEC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Bulldogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_and_Lady_Bulldogs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Bulldogs and Lady Bulldogs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryant\u2013Denny_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/04/10134727/JalenMilroePractice4924.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550573", "eventUri": "eng-9550573", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-31", "textStart": 2197, "textEnd": 2204}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-28", "textStart": 2333, "textEnd": 2341}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

That's not the case now. However, he has been tasked with learning a new offense and figuring out how to run it while adjusting to a new coaching staff.\n\n\"Then, I think there were times it was really good and then add some more install and it drops off a little bit, but I think as the Spring went on again, he continued to elevate. Just playing ball. Just moving the chains and playing ball and not trying to run a play but run an offense. So, I think he did a good job of that,\" DeBoer said.\n\n\"The Spring Game there were some drops that didn't help him out and things like that, but I thought the ball was where it needed to be and it was on time.

So, you know, right now, Jalen Milroe is a guy that can do both - run and pass. His ability to run the football and be a threat in that way makes our rushing attack even better,\" DeBoer said.\n\n\"We have great tailbacks.

Here in this league, the physicality that comes along and is critical to winning football games? I don't care if it's the SEC, I don't care what level you're at. It's important. The system is built to be able to work with him and do those things.

There's a clear direction now, as opposed to just a few years ago.\n\nThat hasn't necessarily made navigating NIL easy, per se, but it has given coaches the chance to adjust.\n\n\"Yeah it's certainly a different landscape than it was just a few years back,\" DeBoer said on The Ryen Russillo Podcast. \"And I think it takes everyone. It takes not just me but it takes all of our coaching staff. And when I say that I'm talking about just the relationships and how important they are, the vision that you have for each guy and his role on the team and the value that they can bring.\"\n\nPaint a picture for players of exactly what they have to do to contribute and how them playing can change their future and you start to get invested athletes.\n\n\"I think when you really try to keep the main thing about that I think that's where you get off to a pretty good start,\" Kalen DeBoer said. \"It's an investment of time and it's got to be who you are. You've got to enjoy conversations, you've got to enjoy helping people. But when those players in our program feel like we really have their best interests involved in all our decisions and we really want this timeframe that they're in during their college football days to be special. To me, when they feel that and you're open and honest with them, I think that's key. That's how you do a good job of having retention.\"\n\nFor DeBoer, building the right culture can lead to the right results. A lot of the NIL snags get smoothed over when the program sort of takes care of itself with the right personalities in the building.\n\nThat starts with DeBoer and his staff being consistent on a daily basis.\n\n\"I'm a believer everywhere I've been, whether it's your staff or your players, your team, you've got that retention, that continuity is key,\" Kalen DeBoer said. \"Staffing, I could go on and on about the different places and how that continuity, how important that was to taking the next steps. And players deciding to come back instead of entering the draft, that was critical.\n\n\"The talent is one thing but just that meshing of personalities, that meshing and taking on their roles and understanding it, then the development that comes along with it.

In that time, DeBoer was complimentary of several positions, including the Crimson Tide quarterback room, which featured four scholarship signal-callers.\n\nQuarterback was actually one of four groups that impressed the new head coach the most over two months of spring ball, and he praised the entire unit for things like their accuracy, reads and competitiveness. The group is led by Jalen Milroe, who DeBoer routinely praised.\n\nMilroe is back after starting 13 games last season and leading Alabama to an SEC title and a College Football Playoff berth. He threw for 2,834 yards and 23 touchdowns while completing 65.8 percent of his passes in 2023. The dual-threat quarterback also ran for 531 yards and 12 touchdowns on 161 carries, leading all SEC signal-callers in rushing scores.\n\nMilroe capped the spring by throwing for 100 yards on 3-of-9 passing in the A-Day Game as the offense defeated the defense 34-28. After taking in 14 practices and the spring game with Milroe as the No. 1 quarterback, DeBoer was asked on Wednesday where he wants to see Milroe grow this summer as he gets set to be the Tide starter for a second straight year.\n\n\"He really came a long ways in processing, playing the game, moving the chains,\" said DeBoer before teeing off at the Regions Tradition Pro-Am. \"So just when he hits fall camp, I think just having 100 percent confidence in every concept we put in, especially in the first week or two that he's had rep after rep after rep and can not just execute but also run the whole show.\n\n\"Just telling every guy what their responsibility is. And so it goes beyond your position, it goes on to leading the rest of the offense.\"\n\nDuring the spring, Milroe himself discussed his approach to improving this offseason.\n\n\"The biggest thing for me is constantly improving because I'm nowhere near a finished product,\" Milroe said. \"Every time I enter the building, all I want to do is improve and get better.\n\n\"And one thing as a quarterback, you're throwing the ball, so that's one thing now that we're in the offseason is I try to, be the best passer I can be, the best passer in the country. That's the ultimate goal, and that's what we're gonna continue to do now that we're in the offseason.\n\n\"Coach Mitch (Dahlen), Coach (Nick) Sheridan do a really good job with me, and Coach DeBoer is putting me in the direction to be the best quarterback in the country.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlie_potter@on3.com", "name": "Charlie Potter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalen_DeBoer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kalen DeBoer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Tradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/08100822/JalenMilroePractice4124-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550573", "eventUri": "eng-9550573", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Now with 15 spring practices and three scrimmages under his belt, the returning starting quarterback appears to be turning the page when it comes to mastering the first-year head coach's high-flying attack.\n\n\"I think he really came a long ways in processing, playing the game, moving the chains,\" DeBoer said Wednesday when asked about Milroe during the Regions Tradition Pro-Am. \"So when he hits fall camp I think just having 100% confidence in every concept we put in, especially in the first week or two that he's had rep after rep after rep, and can not just execute but also run the whole show. Just telling every guy what their responsibility is and so it goes beyond your position and goes onto leading the rest of the offense.\"\n\nMilroe put up mixed results during the A-Day scrimmage, completing 3 of 9 passes for 100 yards while leading the offense to a 34-28 victory. That included two long passes to Germie Bernard, hitting the Washington transfer for gains of 36 yards and 52 yards. Milroe's passing numbers could have been even better had it not been for several dropped balls during the scrimmage.\n\n\"There was some drops that didn't help him out and things like that,\" DeBoer told radio station WJOX on Wednesday. \"But I thought the ball was where it needed to be, and it was on time and so I'm really excited about the summer and what will lead going into fall camp.\"\n\nDuring his radio interview, DeBoer delved into more of Milroe's offseason improvements, stating the redshirt junior was getting better at going through his progressions as well as being more disciplined with his footwork. While there are still some kinks to iron out, there's optimism that Milroe will be clicking on all cylinders by the time Alabama hits the field again in preseason camp.\n\n\"I think there were times when it was really good, and then all the sudden you add some more install, then it kind of drops off a little bit,\" DeBoer told WJOX. \"I think as the spring went on again, he continued to elevate just playing ball. Just moving the chains and playing ball and not trying to run a play, but run an offense. I thought he did a good job of that.\"\n\nMilroe put his playmaking potential on display last year, piling up 3,365 total yards and 35 total touchdowns during his debut season as a starter. However, there has been some question about how the dual-threat quarterback will operate in DeBoer's pass-heavy scheme.\n\nMilroe threw for 2,834 yards and 23 touchdowns with six interceptions last season. While he excelled at delivering the deep ball, he struggled to maintain consistency in the intermediate passing game. That's a stark contrast to Heisman Trophy runner-up Michael Penix Jr., who led the nation with 4,903 yards while spraying the ball across the field on all levels in DeBoer's Washington offense last season.\n\nThroughout the offseason, DeBoer has spoken about implementing ways to utilize Milroe's skill set in his scheme. During an interview on the \"Bussin' With The Boys\" podcast released last month, the starting quarterback expressed confidence in Alabama's new offense, stating it allows him the freedom to make any play he deems necessary on the field\n\n\"I think I can do whatever I want,\" Milroe said. \"Whether run it, throw it, I can do whatever I want in this offense. So if I want to choose to run it the whole game, I can run it the whole game. If I choose to throw it this game, I can throw it this game. I'm just very confident in our coaching staff, confident in what they see in the future a far as our offense.\"", "source": {"uri": "alabama.rivals.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rivals.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tony_tsoukalas@alabama.rivals.com", "name": "Tony Tsoukalas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Milroe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Milroe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalen_DeBoer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kalen DeBoer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WJOX_(AM)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WJOX (AM)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Tradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirt_(college_sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Redshirt (college sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Penix_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Penix Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.rivals.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,t_large/xod7e68zs5nm63ixajqo", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550573", "eventUri": "eng-9550573", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

While he is expected to miss the majority, if not all, of the coming season, the sophomore receiver took to social media on Monday telling fans \"Dont count me out\" regarding a return.\n\nDuring the Regions Tradition at Greystone Golf and Country Club on Wednesday, DeBoer also left the door open for the receiver's return.\n\n\"This season will certainly be a tough one, but I don't wanna also say that he would be out the entire year,\" DeBoer said. \"Also, it depends on how long the season goes. He's done an amazing job, and the process and recovery for him has been sped up just even since the injury happened back in the spring.\n\n\"He's got an amazing mindset about him, and because of that, that's why he's having that progress at such a fast pace.\"\n\nHale recorded five receptions for 48 yards and a touchdown during his debut season last year. His biggest game came against Ole Miss when he reeled in two catches for 63 yards, including a contested 33-yard catch in the end zone.\n\nWhile Alabama has plenty of depth in its receiving corps, Hale (6-foot-1, 189 pounds) is one of the bigger players in the unit. Before his injury, the Longview, Texas native worked at the X receiver position alongside redshirt freshman Jarin Hamilton and freshman Caleb Odom this spring.

On Thursday, the Maple Leafs became the latest team to part ways with their head coach, as Sheldon Keefe was let go after five years with the team.\n\nSpeaking to Pierre LeBrun, DeBoer says the turnover in head coaches is quite surreal for him:\n\n\"It's insanity. We coach in an age where everyone talks about the modern athlete, building relationships in order to coach them. How do you do that with that kind of turnover?\n\n\"It's like going on a date and getting married and divorced before the appetizers show up. I don't get it. But that's the world we live in.\"\n\nAccording to NHL.com, Keefe was the 11th head coach fired this season, joining Jay Woodcroft (Edmonton Oilers), Lane Lambert (New York Islanders), Dean Evason (Minnesota Wild), Craig Berube (St. Louis Blues), Lindy Ruff (New Jersey Devils), D.J. Smith (Ottawa Senators), Todd McLellan (Los Angeles Kings), Don Granato (Buffalo Sabres), David Quinn (San Jose Sharks) and Dave Hakstol (Seattle Kraken).\n\nPeter DeBoer and the Dallas Stars look to even the series\n\nPeter DeBoer and the Dallas Stars are currently down 1-0 in their second-round playoff series against the Colorado Avalanche.\n\nIn the first matchup, Dallas initially held a 3-0 lead but ultimately lost in OT with the final score of 3-4 at American Airlines Center. Heading into Game 2 on Thursday, DeBoer says his team needs to get scoring from all their lines if they are going to beat Colorado.\n\n\"A lot of times you don't know the whole story, and I'm not going to give you the whole story,\" DeBoer said (via NHL.com). \"But what I will say is, he's not alone in that boat.\n\n\"I mean, the strength of our team all year has been, if Roope Hintz's line doesn't score, then Matt Duchene's line scores. If Matt Duchene's line doesn't score, then Wyatt Johnston's line scores. If none of those guys score, our fourth line scores. This isn't on Roope Hintz.

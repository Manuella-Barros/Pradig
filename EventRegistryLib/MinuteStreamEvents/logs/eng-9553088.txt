Bags are being checked and visitors are only allowed to bring in small purses.\n\nIsraeli contestant Eden Golan, 20, will perform her song \"Hurricane\" in the second semi-final later on Thursday.\n\nA large crowd of protesters gathered on Malmo's central square Stortorget, some 7 kilometres (4.35 miles) from the competition venue, waiving Palestinian flags and shouting \"boycott Israel\".\n\nSwedish authorities have heightened security and are bracing for possible unrest, and there was a significant police presence in the square, live footage showed.\n\nProtester Kasia Wiatrowska, from Malmo, wore a green T-shirt with the words \"Libre Palestine\" on the back.\n\n\"I do like Eurovision,\" Wiatrowska said. \"We all love music. But this year music is dividing people, and I don't like that,\" she added.\n\n'HYPOCRISY AND DOUBLE STANDARDS'\n\nPolice estimate that about 5,000 people attended the demonstration.\n\nA protester, Palestinian Amar, who only gave one name, said: \"I'm here today because I see the hypocrisy and double standards around the world.\"\n\n\"We are against what's happening in Gaza right now. But I also want people to understand that we don't hate Jews,\" he added.\n\nA pro-Israel demonstration is also scheduled for Thursday at 1600 GMT.\n\nThere is high security around the delegations from all the countries, according to Malmo police. \"We're keeping a bit of an extra eye on Israel of course, because of the situation,\" Lotta Svensson, a police incident commander, told Reuters on Sunday.\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the event, has resisted calls for Israel to be excluded but asked the country to modify the lyrics of its original song \"October Rain\", which appeared to reference the Hamas attack.\n\nIsraeli contestant Golan says she hopes her performance will help to unite people.\n\n\"It's a super important moment for us, especially this year,\" she told Reuters in an interview this week. \"I feel honoured to have the opportunity to be the voice of my country.\"\n\nThursday's semi-final is due to begin at 1900 GMT and will also

Nine people had been taken into custody and one person was arrested on suspicion of a serious crime against the Knife Act.\n\nProtester Eric Goran said in the past he would usually watch Eurovision, which is organised by the European Broadcasting Union and has been held since 1956.\n\n\"This year I lost all respect for the EBU,\" he said. \"It's clear that they can't take a standpoint against what's going on. I think the only right thing to do is to boycott Israel.\"\n\nSwedish authorities have heightened security, bracing for possible unrest.\n\nMetal barricades and large concrete blocks have been put up around Malmo Arena, which is hosting the competition, and snipers were visible on buildings in the arena.\n\nIsraeli contestant Eden Golan, 20, will perform her song \"Hurricane\". In a video statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Golan for her participation.\n\n\"You are not only taking on Eurovision in a proud and very impressive manner, you are also contending successfully with an ugly wave of antisemitism - and representing the State of Israel with enormous honour,\" Netanyahu said.\n\n'HYPOCRISY AND DOUBLE STANDARDS'\n\nProtester Amar, a Palestinian who declined to give his second name, said: \"I'm here today because I see the hypocrisy and double standards around the world.\"\n\n\"We are against what's happening in Gaza right now. But I also want people to understand that we don't hate Jews.\"\n\nA smaller pro-Israel demonstration was held later on Thursday, a few hundred metres from the pro-Palestinian protest, with attendants holding hands and dancing in a circle to old Israeli Eurovision hits.\n\n\"I'm here to defend Israel,\" said Rolf, 70, from the Swedish city of Lund, declining to give his second name.\n\n\"We are only a little group, but we want to be seen as well. I think it's a shame that this girl from Israel who is performing today has to stand against all this... She certainly feels the pressure.\"\n\nThe EBU has resisted calls for Israel to be excluded but asked the country to modify the lyrics of its original song \"October Rain\", which appeared to reference the Hamas attack.\n\nGolan says she hopes her performance will help to unite people.\n\n\"It's a super important moment for us, especially this year,\" she told Reuters in an interview this

Nine people had been taken into custody and one person was arrested on suspicion of a serious crime against the Knife Act.\n\nProtester Eric Goran said in the past he would usually watch Eurovision, which is organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and has been held since 1956.\n\n\"This year I lost all respect for the EBU,\" he said. \"It's clear that they can't take a standpoint against what's going on. I think the only right thing to do is to boycott Israel.\"\n\nSwedish authorities have heightened security, bracing for possible unrest.\n\nMetal barricades and large concrete blocks have been put up around Malmo Arena, which is hosting the competition, and snipers were visible on buildings in the arena.\n\nIsraeli contestant Eden Golan, 20, will perform her song \"Hurricane\". In a video statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Golan for her participation.\n\n\"You are not only taking on Eurovision in a proud and very impressive manner, you are also contending successfully with an ugly wave of antisemitism - and representing the State of Israel with enormous honour,\" Netanyahu said.\n\n'HYPOCRISY AND DOUBLE STANDARDS'\n\nProtester Amar, a Palestinian who declined to give his second name, said: \"I'm here today because I see the hypocrisy and double standards around the world.\"\n\n\"We are against what's happening in Gaza right now. But I also want people to understand that we don't hate Jews.\"\n\nA smaller pro-Israel demonstration was held later on Thursday, a few hundred metres from the pro-Palestinian protest, with attendants holding hands and dancing in a circle to old Israeli Eurovision hits.\n\n\"I'm here to defend Israel,\" said Rolf, 70, from the Swedish city of Lund, declining to give his second name.\n\n\"We are only a little group, but we want to be seen as well. I think it's a shame that this girl from Israel who is performing today has to stand against all this... She certainly feels the pressure.\"\n\nThe EBU has resisted calls for Israel to be excluded but asked the country to modify the lyrics of its original song \"October Rain\", which appeared to reference the Hamas attack.\n\nGolan says she hopes her performance will help to unite people.\n\n\"It's a super important moment for us, especially this year,\" she told Reuters in an interview this week. \"I feel honoured to have the opportunity to be the voice of my country.\"\n\nThursday's semi-final will also feature contestants from Malta, Albania, Greece, Switzerland, the Czech Republic,

Nine people had been taken into custody and one person was arrested on suspicion of a serious crime against the Knife Act.\n\nProtester Eric Goran said in the past he would usually watch Eurovision, which is organised by the European Broadcasting Union and has been held since 1956.\n\n\"This year I lost all respect for the EBU,\" he said. \"It's clear that they can't take a standpoint against what's going on. I think the only right thing to do is to boycott Israel.\"\n\nSwedish authorities have heightened security, bracing for possible unrest.\n\nMetal barricades and large concrete blocks have been put up around Malmo Arena, which is hosting the competition, and snipers were visible on buildings in the arena.\n\nIsraeli contestant Eden Golan, 20, will perform her song \"Hurricane\". In a video statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Golan for her participation.\n\n\"You are not only taking on Eurovision in a proud and very impressive manner, you are also contending successfully with an ugly wave of antisemitism - and representing the State of Israel with enormous honour,\" Netanyahu said.\n\n'HYPOCRISY AND DOUBLE STANDARDS'\n\nProtester Amar, a Palestinian who declined to give his second name, said: \"I'm here today because I see the hypocrisy and double standards around the world.\"\n\n\"We are against what's happening in Gaza right now. But I also want people to understand that we don't hate Jews.\"\n\nA smaller pro-Israel demonstration was held later on Thursday, a few hundred metres from the pro-Palestinian protest, with attendants holding hands and dancing in a circle to old Israeli Eurovision hits.\n\n\"I'm here to defend Israel,\" said Rolf, 70, from the Swedish city of Lund, declining to give his second name.\n\n\"We are only a little group, but we want to be seen as well. I think it's a shame that this girl from Israel who is performing today has to stand against all this... She certainly feels the pressure.\"\n\nThe EBU has resisted calls for Israel to be excluded but asked the country to modify the lyrics of its original song \"October Rain\", which appeared to reference the Hamas attack.\n\nGolan says she hopes her performance will help to unite people.\n\n\"It's a super important moment for us, especially this year,\" she told Reuters in an interview this week. \"I feel honoured to have the opportunity to be the voice of my country.\"\n\nThursday's semi-final will also feature contestants from Malta, Albania, Greece, Switzerland, the Czech Republic,

Simply magnificent!!!\n\nAnother said: \"#Israel bringing a song that could be the new hit from a Disney movie.\"\n\nEden cheered and thanked viewers as Israel were named as the fifth country on the night to make the grand final.\n\nSweden's third largest city was flooded with demonstrators waving Palestinian flags on Thursday to protest Israel's participation in the Eurovision Song Contest this week.\n\nGolan, 20, is due to perform at the second semi-final of the competition later this evening but has been ordered to stay in her hotel room by her country's national security agency Shin Bet.\n\nIt was reported earlier that Shin Bet had warned Golan not to step outside except for performances over fears for her own safety.\n\nMalmo had been anticipating the wave of pro-Palestinian demonstrations and it was feared the young Israeli-Russian singer could find herself at risk.\n\nAs many as 5,000 people have taken to Malmo's streets today, with smoke canisters in the colours of the Palestinian flag being set off and protesters carrying signs displaying images of Gaza victims.\n\nAmongst the large number protesting against Israel's inclusion in Eurovision, however, was climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nThe young Swede was pictured wearing a keffiyeh - a black and white shawl commonly used to show support for Palestine - around her body in the centre of the crowd.\n\nSurrounded by a sea of Palestinian flags, she told Reuters news agency: \"Young people are leading the way and showing the world how we should react to this.\"\n\nShe refused to comment on why she had joined the protest, however, only saying it was \"good\" as the march took place.\n\nSome protesters had even brought along their dogs and young children to join in the march, while others held banners displaying anti-Eurovision messages.\n\nOne read \"welcome to Genocide song contest\", while \"stop using Eurovision to whitewash Israeli crimes\" was written on another.\n\nThere was even a banner done in the style of Eurovision with the word \"genocide\" on it, an accusation vigorously denied by Israel amid the country's war with Hamas following the terror group's October 7 attack.\n\nDuring the march, chants of \"Eurovision shame on you! Blood is on your hands too!\" rung out around downtown Malmo.\n\nWhile the sound of police helicopters circling overhead couldn't drown them out, officers on the ground managed to intervene and stop some of the protesters in their tracks.\n\nThere was a significant police presence in the square as Swedish authorities heighten security ahead of possible unrest.\n\nMalmo had already been taken over by approximately 100,000 visitors for the annual kitsch-fest before 5,000 protesters made themselves known.\n\nSecurity fears ahead of the remainder of Eurovision have only increased as a result, with the final taking place on Saturday.\n\nMetal barricades and large concrete blocks have been put up around Malmo Arena, the host venue, where visitors must pass through metal detectors before entering.\n\nBags are being checked and visitors are only allowed to bring in small purses, with organisers concerned political demonstrations could take place in the crowd.\n\nGolan is expected to perform her song Hurricane in tonight's semi final, a piece reworked from an early track October Rain - thought to be a reference to the attack by Hamas.\n\nDuring her rehearsals on Wednesday, however, she was booed and there were reported shouts of \"free Palestine\".\n\nGolan vowed that \"nothing will deter\" her after the performance was interrupted by protesters, vowing that she was \"proud to represent my country\".\n\nOthers in the large crowd did applaud her, though, and the young singer hopes her performance will help to unite people.\n\n\"It's a super important moment for us, especially this year,\" she said earlier this week. \"I feel honoured to have the opportunity to be the voice of my country.\"\n\nIsrael's involvement in the competition has been met with fierce criticism due to the country's ongoing war against Hamas inside the Gaza Strip.\n\nHowever, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the event, has dismissed calls for Israel to be excluded.\n\nThe competition bills itself as a non-political event and can disqualify countries who break that neutrality rules.\n\nThursday's semi-final is due to begin at 7pm (GMT) and will feature contestants from Malta, Albania, Greece, the Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia and Norway.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType":

fire under control, but authorities on alert due to strong winds\n\nGreece's Marina Satti secured a spot in the Eurovision Grand Final, after a captivating performance of her song \"ZARI\" at the second semi-final on Thursday evening.\n\nGreece was among the ten countries that advanced to the final, joining Latvia, Austria, the Netherlands, Norway, Israel, Estonia, Switzerland, Georgia, and Armenia in the competition.\n\nSatti's performance, which blended modern, traditional, and ethnic elements, thrilled audiences in the arena and viewers at home.\n\nSome 100,000 visitors have gathered in the southern Swedish city of Malmo for the annual contest, under heavy police presence as authorities brace for possible unrest.\n\nEurovision organisers had resisted calls to exclude Israel over its military campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, arguing that the competition is a non-political event.\n\nIsraeli solo artist Eden Golan, 20, and her song 'Hurricane' qualified on Thursday alongside nine others for Saturday's grand show, which will feature performances from 26 countries.\n\nSome booing was heard from the crowd before, during and after Golan's performance but also applause and Israeli flags waving, according to a Reuters journalist in the auditorium.\n\nMore than 10,000 pro-Palestinian campaigners, including climate activist Greta Thunberg, staged a non-violent protest in the hours ahead of the semi-final, waiving Palestinian flags and shouting \"boycott Israel\".\n\nA smaller group of pro-Israeli supporters, including members of Malmo's Jewish community, also staged a peaceful demonstration in the city, defending Golan and her nation's right to take part in the contest.\n\nHundreds of artists in Sweden and elsewhere had urged that Israel should be blocked from taking part, as did two Belgian government ministers earlier this year.\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the event, requested earlier this year that Israel tweak its initial lyrics in order to participate, saying they had originally made reference to the Oct. 7 onslaught.\n\nIn a video statement earlier on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Golan for her participation.\n\n\"You are not only taking on Eurovision in a proud and very impressive manner, you are also contending successfully with an ugly wave of antisemitism - and representing the State of Israel with enormous honour,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nGolan has said she hopes her performance will help unite people.\n\n\"It's a super important moment for us, especially this year,\" she told Reuters in an interview this week. \"I feel honoured to have the opportunity to be the voice of my country.\"", "source": {"uri": "in-cyprus.philenews.com", "dataType": "news",

Blood is on your hands too!\" rung out around downtown Malmo.\n\nWhile the sound of police helicopters circling overhead couldn't drown them out, officers on the ground managed to intervene and stop some of the protesters in their tracks.\n\nThere was a significant police presence in the square as Swedish authorities heighten security ahead of possible unrest.\n\nMalmo had already been taken over by approximately 100,000 visitors for the annual kitsch-fest before 5,000 protesters made themselves known.\n\nSecurity fears ahead of the remainder of Eurovision have only increased as a result, with the final taking place on Saturday.\n\nMetal barricades and large concrete blocks have been put up around Malmo Arena, the host venue, where visitors must pass through metal detectors before entering.\n\nBags are being checked and visitors are only allowed to bring in small purses, with organisers concerned political demonstrations could take place in the crowd.\n\nGolan is expected to perform her song Hurricane in tonight's semi final, a piece reworked from an early track October Rain - thought to be a reference to the attack by Hamas.\n\nDuring her rehearsals on Wednesday, however, she was booed and there were reported shouts of \"free Palestine\".\n\nGolan vowed that \"nothing will deter\" her after the performance was interrupted by protesters, vowing that she was \"proud to represent my country\".\n\nOthers in the large crowd did applaud her, though, and the young singer hopes her performance will help to unite people.\n\n\"It's a super important moment for us, especially this year,\" she said earlier this week. \"I feel honoured to have the opportunity to be the voice of my country.\"\n\nIsrael's involvement in the competition has been met with fierce criticism due to the country's ongoing war against Hamas inside the Gaza Strip.\n\nHowever, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the event, has dismissed calls for Israel to be excluded.\n\nThe competition bills itself as a non-political event and can disqualify countries who break that neutrality rules.\n\nThursday's semi-final is due to begin at 7pm (GMT) and will feature contestants from Malta, Albania, Greece, the Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia and Norway.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk",

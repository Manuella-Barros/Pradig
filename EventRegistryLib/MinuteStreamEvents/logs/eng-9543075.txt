Between speeches by those close to Weeks and mournful, acoustic folk songs, the officer was remembered not only for his commitment to his job but also his love for those around him.\n\nWeeks was one of four officers killed last week while attempting to serve a warrant of felony possession of a firearm to a suspect at a Charlotte home. Officers shot and killed the wanted man, 39-year-old Terry Clark Hughes Jr., during the three-hour standoff. Four other officers were also injured.\n\nIt was the deadliest shooting against law enforcement officers since 2016 when a sniper shot five officers at a Dallas protest.\n\nWeeks' memorial was the second of four planned for the fallen officers, following a service on Friday commemorating the life of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Officer Joshua Eyer. The other two officers killed were William Elliott and Sam Poloche of the North Carolina Department of Adult Corrections.\n\nOriginally from Maryland, Weeks joined the U.S. Marshals Service in 2011 and initially worked at the D.C. Superior Court. As a former federal judge himself, Garland vouched for the importance of Weeks' job, saying how judicial officials often put their lives in the hands of deputy marshals.\n\n''It means stepping up and showing up when things are most difficult and most painful. It means facing unacceptable threats and danger. It means supporting people and communities when they are experiencing some of their darkest days,\" Garland said on Monday.\n\nThose who worked with Weeks described him as ''intense and full of conviction,'' Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Joe Graham said. His dedication to the job could lead him to be a bit matter-of-fact, such as when he had to stop a scuffle in then-U.S. District Judge Robert Conrad's courtroom, according to the former judge. When asked to testify about the conflict, Weeks just said: \"He acted up. I took care of it.''\n\nBut Weeks always treated everyone with respect, no matter what side of the courtroom someone was on, Conrad said.\n\nHis kind nature and dry sense of humor were remembered by his coworkers. When one of his colleagues became a grandmother, Weeks started to lovingly refer to her as ''Meemaw,'' according to Garland, who said he didn't know Weeks personally but heard stories from those who did.\n\nAnother time, when someone told Weeks he was out of shape, he joked that ''round is a shape,'' Garland said.\n\nIn 2014, Weeks received the ''best email of his life,'' according to his longtime friend and U.S. Deputy Marshal Ryan King, speaking at the memorial. Weeks was switching posts to the Western District of North Carolina, where he could be reunited with his wife and children in Mooresville.\n\nKing, who met Weeks when he first started at the D.C. Superior Court, eventually moved to the Western District of North Carolina in 2020, working out of a cubicle right next to his buddy. It was like old times between the two friends, who went tailgating together to support the Carolina Panthers football team and hung out at local pubs, he said.\n\n''Tommy boy was a true shining star,'' King said.\n\nCheering on all D.C.-area teams was one of Weeks' passions, whether it was the Washington Nationals baseball team or the Washington Capitals ice hockey team, King said. He even participated in sports leagues himself, in particular a hockey team for law enforcement officers.\n\nIf Weeks knew his memorial would be held at Bojangles Coliseum, where the Charlotte Checkers hockey team plays, his wife Kelly said he would be thrilled. He also would have been ''humbled by all the people'' in attendance, she said.\n\nAside from being a sports fanatic, Weeks would be remembered as a loving father and husband, Kelly said. Nightly hugs and Dunkin' Donuts runs were just a few examples of ways he showed care for his four children, she continued.\n\nEvery morning, Weeks told Kelly he loved her and reminded her how lucky he was to have her, she recalled. But now reflecting, Kelly said she was ''truly the lucky one.''\n\n''He was already a hero to me in our family,'' Kelly said.\n\nWeeks was a star that burned bright but fast, Kelly said. She said she hopes her husband's legacy can inspire others, like how stars in the universe are born out of other stars' death.\n\n''Tommy's mission in life was to make the world safer and fight for justice. So what do I need?'' his wife asked. ''I need this country to come together to support our law enforcement officers so they can continue to fight for justice like my husband did.''", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType":

Between speeches by those close to Weeks and mournful, acoustic folk songs, the officer was remembered not only for his commitment to his job but also his love for those around him.\n\nWeeks was one of four officers killed last week while attempting to serve a warrant of felony possession of a firearm to a suspect at a Charlotte home. Officers shot and killed the wanted man, 39-year-old Terry Clark Hughes Jr., during the three-hour standoff. Four other officers were also injured.\n\nIt was the deadliest shooting against law enforcement officers since 2016 when a sniper shot five officers at a Dallas protest.\n\nKelly Weeks, center, the widow of slain Deputy U.S. Marshal Thomas Weeks Jr., glances over at attendees of her husband's memorial service at Bojangles Coliseum in Charlotte, N.C. on Monday, May 6, 2024. (Jeff Siner/The Charlotte Observer via AP)\n\nWeeks' memorial was the second of four planned for the fallen officers, following a service on Friday commemorating the life of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Officer Joshua Eyer. The other two officers killed were William Elliott and Sam Poloche of the North Carolina Department of Adult Corrections.\n\nOriginally from Maryland, Weeks joined the U.S. Marshals Service in 2011 and initially worked at the D.C. Superior Court. As a former federal judge himself, Garland vouched for the importance of Weeks' job, saying how judicial officials often put their lives in the hands of deputy marshals.\n\n\"It means stepping up and showing up when things are most difficult and most painful. It means facing unacceptable threats and danger. It means supporting people and communities when they are experiencing some of their darkest days,\" Garland said on Monday.\n\nThose who worked with Weeks described him as \"intense and full of conviction,\" Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Joe Graham said. His dedication to the job could lead him to be a bit matter-of-fact, such as when he had to stop a scuffle in then-U.S. District Judge Robert Conrad's courtroom, according to the former judge. When asked to testify about the conflict, Weeks just said: \"he acted up. I took care of it.\"\n\nBut Weeks always treated everyone with respect, no matter what side of the courtroom someone was on, Conrad said.\n\nHis kind nature and dry sense of humor were remembered by his coworkers. When one of his colleagues became a grandmother, Weeks started to lovingly refer to her as \"Meemaw,\" according to Garland, who said he didn't know Weeks personally but heard stories from those who did.\n\nAnother time, when someone told Weeks he was out of shape, he joked that \"round is a shape,\" Garland said.\n\nIn 2014, Weeks received the \"best email of his life,\" according to his longtime friend and U.S. Deputy Marshal Ryan King, speaking at the memorial. Weeks was switching posts to the Western District of North Carolina, where he could be reunited with his wife and children in Mooresville.\n\nKing, who met Weeks when he first started at the D.C. Superior Court, eventually moved to the Western District of North Carolina in 2020, working out of a cubicle right next to his buddy. It was like old times between the two friends, who went tailgating together to support the Carolina Panthers football team and hung out at local pubs, he said.\n\n\"Tommy boy was a true shining star,\" King said.\n\nCheering on all D.C.-area teams was one of Weeks' passions, whether it was the Washington Nationals baseball team or the Washington Capitals ice hockey team, King said. He even participated in sports leagues himself, in particular a hockey team for law enforcement officers.\n\nIf Weeks knew his memorial would be held at Bojangles Coliseum, where the Charlotte Checkers hockey team plays, his wife Kelly said he would be thrilled. He also would have been \"humbled by all the people\" in attendance, she said.\n\nAside from being a sports fanatic, Weeks would be remembered as a loving father and husband, Kelly said. Nightly hugs and Dunkin' Donuts runs were just a few examples of ways he showed care for his four children, she continued.\n\nEvery morning, Weeks told Kelly he loved her and reminded her how lucky he was to have her, she recalled. But now reflecting, Kelly said she was \"truly the lucky one.\"\n\n\"He was already a hero to me in our family,\" Kelly said.\n\nWeeks was a star that burned bright but fast, Kelly said. She said she hopes her husband's legacy can inspire others, like how stars in the universe are born out of other stars\u00b4 death.\n\n\"Tommy\u00b4s mission in life was to make the world safer and fight for justice. So what do I need?\" his wife asked. \"I need this country to come together to support our law enforcement officers so they can continue to fight for justice like my husband did.\"\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland climbs the stairs to the lectern to speak during a memorial service for slain U.S. Marshal Thomas Weeks Jr., at Bojangles Coliseum in Charlotte, N.C. on Monday, May 6, 2024.

Between speeches by those close to Weeks and mournful, acoustic folk songs, the officer was remembered not only for his commitment to his job but also his love for those around him.\n\nWeeks was one of four officers killed last week while attempting to serve a warrant of felony possession of a firearm to a suspect at a Charlotte home. Officers shot and killed the wanted man, 39-year-old Terry Clark Hughes Jr., during the three-hour standoff. Four other officers were also injured.\n\nIt was the deadliest shooting against law enforcement officers since 2016 when a sniper shot five officers at a Dallas protest.\n\nWeeks' memorial was the second of four planned for the fallen officers, following a service on Friday commemorating the life of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Officer Joshua Eyer. The other two officers killed were William Elliott and Sam Poloche of the North Carolina Department of Adult Corrections.\n\nOriginally from Maryland, Weeks joined the U.S. Marshals Service in 2011 and initially worked at the D.C. Superior Court. As a former federal judge himself, Garland vouched for the importance of Weeks' job, saying how judicial officials often put their lives in the hands of deputy marshals.\n\n\"It means stepping up and showing up when things are most difficult and most painful. It means facing unacceptable threats and danger. It means supporting people and communities when they are experiencing some of their darkest days,\" Garland said on Monday.\n\nThose who worked with Weeks described him as \"intense and full of conviction,\" Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Joe Graham said. His dedication to the job could lead him to be a bit matter-of-fact, such as when he had to stop a scuffle in then-U.S. District Judge Robert Conrad's courtroom, according to the former judge. When asked to testify about the conflict, Weeks just said: \"he acted up. I took care of it.\"\n\nBut Weeks always treated everyone with respect, no matter what side of the courtroom someone was on, Conrad said.\n\nHis kind nature and dry sense of humor were remembered by his coworkers. When one of his colleagues became a grandmother, Weeks started to lovingly refer to her as \"Meemaw,\" according to Garland, who said he didn't know Weeks personally but heard stories from those who did.\n\nAnother time, when someone told Weeks he was out of shape, he joked that \"round is a shape,\" Garland said.\n\nIn 2014, Weeks received the \"best email of his life,\" according to his longtime friend and U.S. Deputy Marshal Ryan King, speaking at the memorial. Weeks was switching posts to the Western District of North Carolina, where he could be reunited with his wife and children in Mooresville.\n\nKing, who met Weeks when he first started at the D.C. Superior Court, eventually moved to the Western District of North Carolina in 2020, working out of a cubicle right next to his buddy. It was like old times between the two friends, who went tailgating together to support the Carolina Panthers football team and hung out at local pubs, he said.\n\n\"Tommy boy was a true shining star,\" King said.\n\nCheering on all D.C.-area teams was one of Weeks' passions, whether it was the Washington Nationals baseball team or the Washington Capitals ice hockey team, King said. He even participated in sports leagues himself, in particular a hockey team for law enforcement officers.\n\nIf Weeks knew his memorial would be held at Bojangles Coliseum, where the Charlotte Checkers hockey team plays, his wife Kelly said he would be thrilled. He also would have been \"humbled by all the people\" in attendance, she said.\n\nAside from being a sports fanatic, Weeks would be remembered as a loving father and husband, Kelly said. Nightly hugs and Dunkin' Donuts runs were just a few examples of ways he showed care for his four children, she continued.\n\nEvery morning, Weeks told Kelly he loved her and reminded her how lucky he was to have her, she recalled. But now reflecting, Kelly said she was \"truly the lucky one.\"\n\n\"He was already a hero to me in our family,\" Kelly said.\n\nWeeks was a star that burned bright but fast, Kelly said. She said she hopes her husband's legacy can inspire others, like how stars in the universe are born out of other stars' death.\n\n\"Tommy's mission in life was to make the world safer and fight for justice. So what do I need?\" his wife asked. \"I need this country to come together to support our law enforcement officers so they can continue to fight for justice like my husband did.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Between speeches by those close to Weeks and mournful, acoustic folk songs, the officer was remembered not only for his commitment to his job but also his love for those around him.\n\nWeeks was one of four officers killed last week while attempting to serve a warrant of felony possession of a firearm to a suspect at a Charlotte home. Officers shot and killed the wanted man, 39-year-old Terry Clark Hughes Jr., during the three-hour standoff. Four other officers were also injured.\n\nIt was the deadliest shooting against law enforcement officers since 2016 when a sniper shot five officers at a Dallas protest.\n\nWeeks' memorial was the second of four planned for the fallen officers, following a service on Friday commemorating the life of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Officer Joshua Eyer. The other two officers killed were William Elliott and Sam Poloche of the North Carolina Department of Adult Corrections.\n\nOriginally from Maryland, Weeks joined the U.S. Marshals Service in 2011 and initially worked at the D.C. Superior Court. As a former federal judge himself, Garland vouched for the importance of Weeks' job, saying how judicial officials often put their lives in the hands of deputy marshals.\n\n\"It means stepping up and showing up when things are most difficult and most painful. It means facing unacceptable threats and danger. It means supporting people and communities when they are experiencing some of their darkest days,\" Garland said on Monday.\n\nThose who worked with Weeks described him as \"intense and full of conviction,\" Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Joe Graham said. His dedication to the job could lead him to be a bit matter-of-fact, such as when he had to stop a scuffle in then-U.S. District Judge Robert Conrad's courtroom, according to the former judge. When asked to testify about the conflict, Weeks just said: \"he acted up. I took care of it.\"\n\nBut Weeks always treated everyone with respect, no matter what side of the courtroom someone was on, Conrad said.\n\nHis kind nature and dry sense of humor were remembered by his coworkers. When one of his colleagues became a grandmother, Weeks started to lovingly refer to her as \"Meemaw,\" according to Garland, who said he didn't know Weeks personally but heard stories from those who did.\n\nAnother time, when someone told Weeks he was out of shape, he joked that \"round is a shape,\" Garland said.\n\nIn 2014, Weeks received the \"best email of his life,\" according to his longtime friend and U.S. Deputy Marshal Ryan King, speaking at the memorial. Weeks was switching posts to the Western District of North Carolina, where he could be reunited with his wife and children in Mooresville.\n\nKing, who met Weeks when he first started at the D.C. Superior Court, eventually moved to the Western District of North Carolina in 2020, working out of a cubicle right next to his buddy. It was like old times between the two friends, who went tailgating together to support the Carolina Panthers football team and hung out at local pubs, he said.\n\n\"Tommy boy was a true shining star,\" King said.\n\nCheering on all D.C.-area teams was one of Weeks' passions, whether it was the Washington Nationals baseball team or the Washington Capitals ice hockey team, King said. He even participated in sports leagues himself, in particular a hockey team for law enforcement officers.\n\nIf Weeks knew his memorial would be held at Bojangles Coliseum, where the Charlotte Checkers hockey team plays, his wife Kelly said he would be thrilled. He also would have been \"humbled by all the people\" in attendance, she said.\n\nAside from being a sports fanatic, Weeks would be remembered as a loving father and husband, Kelly said. Nightly hugs and Dunkin' Donuts runs were just a few examples of ways he showed care for his four children, she continued.\n\nEvery morning, Weeks told Kelly he loved her and reminded her how lucky he was to have her, she recalled. But now reflecting, Kelly said she was \"truly the lucky one.\"\n\n\"He was already a hero to me in our family,\" Kelly said.\n\nWeeks was a star that burned bright but fast, Kelly said. She said she hopes her husband's legacy can inspire others, like how stars in the universe are born out of other stars' death.\n\n\"Tommy's mission in life was to make the world safer and fight for justice. So what do I need?\" his wife asked. \"I need this country to come together to support our law enforcement officers so they can continue to fight for justice like my husband did.\"", "source": {"uri":

Weeks was switching posts to the Western District of North Carolina, where he could be reunited with his wife and children in Mooresville.\n\nKing, who met Weeks when he first started at the D.C. Superior Court, eventually moved to the Western District of North Carolina in 2020, working out of a cubicle right next to his buddy. It was like old times between the two friends, who went tailgating together to support the Carolina Panthers football team and hung out at local pubs, he said.\n\n\"Tommy boy was a true shining star,\" King said.\n\nCheering on all D.C.-area teams was one of Weeks' passions, whether it was the Washington Nationals baseball team or the Washington Capitals ice hockey team, King said. He even participated in sports leagues himself, in particular a hockey team for law enforcement officers.\n\nIf Weeks knew his memorial would be held at Bojangles Coliseum, where the Charlotte Checkers hockey team plays, his wife Kelly said he would be thrilled. He also would have been \"humbled by all the people\" in attendance, she said.\n\nAside from being a sports fanatic, Weeks would be remembered as a loving father and husband, Kelly said. Nightly hugs and Dunkin' Donuts runs were just a few examples of ways he showed care for his four children, she continued.\n\nEvery morning, Weeks told Kelly he loved her and reminded her how lucky he was to have her, she recalled. But now reflecting, Kelly said she was \"truly the lucky one.\"\n\n\"He was already a hero to me in our family,\" Kelly said.\n\nWeeks was a star that burned bright but fast, Kelly said. She said she hopes her husband's legacy can inspire others, like how stars in the universe are born out of other stars' death.\n\n\"Tommy's mission in life was to make the world safer and fight for justice. So what do I need?\" his wife asked. \"I need this country to come together to support our law enforcement officers so they can continue to fight for justice like my husband did.\"", "source": {"uri":

Family and friends gathered Monday to say goodbye to Deputy U.S. Marshal Thomas Weeks, a week after he and three others were killed while serving arrest warrants in the East from Charlotte.\n\nThe 13-year veteran of the U.S. Marshals Service was one of four men killed while serving an arrest warrant at an east Charlotte home on April 29. Five other officers were injured in the incident, including three Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officers. The suspect, a convicted felon with a lengthy criminal history throughout North Carolina, was killed during the standoff.\n\nMonday's service included several speakers who knew Weeks well, including two deputy U.S. marshals who served alongside him in North Carolina. Attorney General Merrick Garland also spoke, paying tribute to Weeks' courage in the face of danger on the day he was killed.\n\nKelly Weeks also addressed the huge crowd, telling everyone that her family was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support following the death of her husband.\n\n\"He was a loving father. Not only to his children but also to his stepchildren. He loved everything from watching Patrick while he played, to goodnight hugs and 'I love yous' to Abby.\" , Weeks said.\n\nDONATE NOW: How to help families of fallen officers in Charlotte\n\nWeeks, 48, lived in Mooresville. He was part of the Carolinas Regional Fugitive Task Force. He spent the last 10 years of his career in Charlotte. Before joining the U.S. Marshals Service, he spent eight years in Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThroughout Monday's service, Weeks' colleagues and his wife mentioned how he was an avid sports fan who loved his home state of Maryland. He was a huge hockey fan and loved the Washington Capitals. Kelly Weeks joked that her husband would have been thrilled for his celebration of life to take place where the Checkers play their home games.\n\nGarland, who did not know Weeks personally, used his time at the podium to praise the courageous law enforcement officers who served on the U.S. Marshals task force, saying Monday's shooting is a reminder of how their work is dangerous.\n\n\"On April 29, Tommy made the ultimate sacrifice,\" Garland said. \"Their deaths are a stark reminder of the enormous risk our law enforcement officers face every day, even when making the relatively routine arrests they make every day. Every day, our law enforcement officers go to work knowing that day could be their last. Every day their families send them to work praying that this won't happen.\"\n\n\"I don't think words describe the amount of pain that the Marshals Service and all of its members are feeling, the court family, law enforcement in general, this community and communities across the country,\" said the director of the US Marshals Service, Ronald Davis. .\n\nHe is survived by his wife and four children. Weeks' body was escorted to Mooresville last week. Large crowds gathered along the road to pay their respects to a fallen hero.\n\n\"I get very emotional when something like this happens,\" one man said. \"I cried like a baby. It's sad.

'Tommy' Weeks as someone who loved his family and was committed to public safety.\n\nWeeks was a 48-year-old father of four from Mooresville. He was part of the U.S. Marshals Carolinas Regional Fugitive Task Force, which was trying to serve a warrant Monday when the suspect fired on officers, police said.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, speaking at the ceremony, said that when he called Weeks' wife, Kelly, to express condolences in the loss of her husband, he did not expect her to end the call by asking what she could do to support the Marshals Service and the Justice Department in such a sad time.\n\n\"I called hoping to lift your spirits. The call ended with you lifting mine, and I know that is what you have been doing all week for both your family and for the U.S. Marshals Service family.\n\n\"Mrs. Weeks, I did not have the honor of knowing Tommy, but from everything I have heard about him, I know he would be very proud of you.\"\n\nGarland said Weeks loved his family deeply. \"I know that no words can adequately describe the pain that you are feeling now. That nothing can undo this horrible loss.\"\n\nWeeks was a 13-year veteran of the marshals service, and had been in Charlotte since 2014, according to the marshals service. He started with the service in 2011 in Washington, D.C. Before that, Weeks spent eight years with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nAlso killed last Monday were Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Officer Joshua Eyer and Department of Adult Correction Officers Sam Poloche and William \"Alden Elliott.\" Four other officers were shot and injured at the home on Galway Drive, and an additional officer was treated for a broken foot.\n\nLaw enforcement officers, Garland said, put their lives at risk for the public they serve. \"That is what Tommy did every single day during his career in law enforcement.\"\n\nWeeks took his work seriously and with care, colleagues said.\n\nGarland, a former federal judge, said federal judges put their lives in the hands of U.S. marshals, who secure federal courthouses, and are the best of what public servants should be -- \"dedicated, selfless and courageous.\n\n\"That is what Tommy did. That is what Tommy was. And that is how he lived his life. And that is how he always will be remembered.\"\n\nWeeks and the officers who died made the ultimate sacrifice, he said.\n\n\"Their deaths stand as a stark reminder of the enormous risks our law-enforcement officers face every day, even when making the relatively routine arrests they make every day.\"\n\nThe loss of the officers means the community will never be the same, but \"it will always be safer because of them. There is no more honorable legacy than that.\"\n\nJoe Graham, supervisory deputy U.S. marshal in Charlotte, said the turnout for the service was a testament to Weeks' impact on the community and his country.\n\n\"Let it not be in vain, and let us not forget,\" he said.\n\n\"As members of the United States Marshals Service conducting daily fugitive task force operations ... we suppress evil every day,\" he said, pausing to collect himself. \"But there is a price for this dedication. It requires that we operate in the darkness and maneuver in the shadows so that others may know comfort and safety in the light.\"\n\nHe said the environment for officers made it difficult not to become skeptical, but witnessing the outpouring of support for the four officers killed last Monday renewed his faith in the community.\n\nHe described Weeks as likable, dry-witted, intense and full of conviction, and said Weeks meeting his wife, Kelly, gave him renewed joy in life. \"There was a change in Tommy.

Officers shot and killed the wanted man, 39-year-old Terry Clark Hughes Jr., during the three-hour standoff. Four other officers were also injured.\n\nIt was the deadliest shooting against law enforcement officers since 2016 when a sniper shot five officers at a Dallas protest.\n\nWeeks' memorial was the second of four planned for the fallen officers, following a service on Friday commemorating the life of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Officer Joshua Eyer. The other two officers killed were William Elliott and Sam Poloche of the North Carolina Department of Adult Corrections.\n\nOriginally from Maryland, Weeks joined the U.S. Marshals Service in 2011 and initially worked at the D.C. Superior Court. As a former federal judge himself, Garland vouched for the importance of Weeks' job, saying how judicial officials often put their lives in the hands of deputy marshals.\n\n\"It means stepping up and showing up when things are most difficult and most painful. It means facing unacceptable threats and danger. It means supporting people and communities when they are experiencing some of their darkest days,\" Garland said on Monday.\n\nThose who worked with Weeks described him as \"intense and full of conviction,\" Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Joe Graham said. His dedication to the job could lead him to be a bit matter-of-fact, such as when he had to stop a scuffle in then-U.S. District Judge Robert Conrad's courtroom, according to the former judge. When asked to testify about the conflict, Weeks just said: \"he acted up. I took care of it.\"\n\nBut Weeks always treated everyone with respect, no matter what side of the courtroom someone was on, Conrad said.\n\nHis kind nature and dry sense of humor were remembered by his coworkers. When one of his colleagues became a grandmother, Weeks started to lovingly refer to her as \"Meemaw,\" according to Garland, who said he didn't know Weeks personally but heard stories from those who did.\n\nAnother time, when someone told Weeks he was out of shape, he joked that \"round is a shape,\" Garland said.\n\nIn 2014, Weeks received the \"best email of his life,\" according to his longtime friend and U.S. Deputy Marshal Ryan King, speaking at the memorial. Weeks was switching posts to the Western District of North Carolina, where he could be reunited with his wife and children in Mooresville.\n\nKing, who met Weeks when he first started at the D.C. Superior Court, eventually moved to the Western District of North Carolina in 2020, working out of a cubicle right next to his buddy. It was like old times between the two friends, who went tailgating together to support the Carolina Panthers football team and hung out at local pubs, he said.\n\n\"Tommy boy was a true shining star,\" King said.\n\nCheering on all D.C.-area teams was one of Weeks' passions, whether it was the Washington Nationals baseball team or the Washington Capitals ice hockey team, King said. He even participated in sports leagues himself, in particular a hockey team for law enforcement officers.\n\nIf Weeks knew his memorial would be held at Bojangles Coliseum, where the Charlotte Checkers hockey team plays, his wife Kelly said he would be thrilled. He also would have been \"humbled by all the people\" in attendance, she said.\n\nAside from being a sports fanatic, Weeks would be remembered as a loving father and husband, Kelly said. Nightly hugs and Dunkin' Donuts runs were just a few examples of ways he showed care for his four children, she continued.\n\nEvery morning, Weeks told Kelly he loved her and reminded her how lucky he was to have her, she recalled. But now reflecting, Kelly said she was \"truly the lucky one.\"\n\n\"He was already a hero to me in our family,\" Kelly said.\n\nWeeks was a star that burned bright but fast, Kelly said. She said she hopes her husband's legacy can inspire others, like how stars in the universe are born out of other stars' death.\n\n\"Tommy's mission in life was to make the world safer and fight for justice. So what do I need?\" his wife asked. \"I need this country to come together to support our law enforcement officers so they can continue to fight for justice like my husband did.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(WBTV via NNS)\n\nThe bereaved wife of Deputy U.S. Marshal Thomas M. \"Tommy\" Weeks, who was among four law enforcement officers killed last week in a shootout at a wanted suspect's Charlotte home, spoke of her husband's killer before hundreds gathered for his Monday memorial service, including U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\n\"This tragedy was the result of someone who did not have any regard for human life,\" Kelly Weeks said of the killer, 39-year-old Terry Clark Hughes Jr.\n\nHughes died at the scene after fatally shooting Weeks; North Carolina Department of Adult Correction (NCDAC) Officers Sam Poloche and William \"Alden\" Elliott, who were members of a USMS fugitive task force along with Weeks; and CMPD Officer Joshua Eyer from the second floor of his Galway Drive home in Charlotte on April 29.\n\nFour more law enforcement officers were injured at the scene while trying to serve a warrant for Hughes' arrest. The suspect had an \"extensive\" criminal record, according to North Carolina Public Records and CMPD Chief Johnny Jennings.\n\nCHARLOTTE SHOOTOUT: 4 SLAIN OFFICERS SERVING WARRANT HAD 'GREAT DISADVANTAGE,' EXPERT SAYS\n\nTwo additional persons of interest - both female, one just 17 years old - were taken into custody. Authorities are still working to determine whether anyone else was involved in the shooting.\n\nAuthorities recovered an AR-15 rifle, a 40-caliber handgun, magazines and ammunition from the residence, and Jennings said that over 100 rounds were fired in the shootout.\n\n\"Tommy's mission in life was to make the world safer and fight for justice,\" Weeks' wife said. \"So what do I need? I need this country to come together, to support our law enforcement officers so they can continue to fight for justice just like my husband did. Thank an officer every single day, encourage our children to show police officers the proper respect.\"\n\nThe widowed mother of four hoped the memory of her 48-year-old husband would inspire others to \"lift up his fellow brothers and sisters in any law enforcement capacity.\"\n\nWeeks said her husband was a devoted father and husband, always walking on the inside of the street to protect her from traffic and wanting her within arms length.\n\n\"I woke up every single day to a man telling me he loved me, 'You're the most beautiful woman,' 'How lucky I am to have you.' What he didn't realize is I was the lucky one.\"\n\nWeeks would \"do anything\" to make his loved ones \"feel special,\" his wife said, \"insisting you drink a Guinness or have a glass of whiskey\" and \"inviting you to play golf or come to the lake, or just give you a call to see how you were doing.\"\n\nWeeks was a 13-year veteran of the marshals service and had worked in Charlotte since 2014, the agency said. After beginning his career in law enforcement in Washington, D.C. in 2011, he spent eight years with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nCHARLOTTE OFFICER KILLED IN LINE OF DUTY REMEMBERED IN MEMORIAL AS MAN WHO'D GIVE THE 'SHIRT FROM HIS BACK'\n\nCHARLOTTE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO DIED IN SHOOTOUT IDENTIFIED: 'FOREVER INDEBTED'\n\nHer husband's service made Weeks aware of the risks law enforcement officers take daily to \"protect our bubble.\"\n\n\"As I look out on this crowd, I see so many law enforcement officers here to pay their respects. It is a clear reminder of the sacrifice these men and women make every day,\" she said. \"If you do not serve or have a family with individuals who do serve, you sleep peacefully at night knowing you're protected by many brave men and women.\"\n\nGarland told mourners that he had called Weeks' spouse hoping to lift her spirits - unexpectedly, he said, she lifted his.\n\n\"When I called you last Tuesday to convey the Justice Department's deepest condolences to your family,\" Garland said. \"I hope to in some way be able to provide you with comfort and support in the midst of your unimaginable loss. What I did not expect is that you would end the call by asking me what you could do to support the Marshal Service and the Justice Department in this time of immeasurable sadness.\"\n\nLast week, former FBI agent with Miami's Violent Fugitive Task Force Nicole Parker called upon Garland and the Department of Justice to establish more concrete protocols for arrests and takedowns carried out by the agencies it oversees, including the U.S. Marshals.\n\nShe likened last week's shooting to an incident in February 2021, when FBI Special Agents Daniel Alfin and Laura Schwartzenberger were killed while attempting to serve a warrant on a Florida suspect wanted for violent crimes against children.\n\nCHARLOTTE POLICE CHIEF BREAKS DOWN REMEMBERING 4 SLAIN OFFICERS, SAYS SUSPECT HAD 'EXTENSIVE' CRIMINAL HISTORY\n\nShe noted that Garland did not appear at their funerals, and that no formal changes were made to protect federal agents in similar situations in the future.\n\nLike Weeks' wife, she called for respect for law enforcement officers, both from the public and the federal government.\n\n\"Until our country wakes up and shows respect, learns lessons from these tragedies, shares those lessons and makes some changes, it's going to keep happening,\" Parker said. \"That's why everyone's leaving - law enforcement officers don't feel like anyone has our backs.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPresident Biden visited Charlotte on Thursday to meet the fallen officers' families and members of CMPD, and wrote in a statement that \"we must do more to protect our law enforcement officers.\"\n\n\"That means funding them - so they have the resources they need to do their jobs and keep us safe,\" the President said in a Monday statement. \"And it means taking additional action to combat the scourge of gun violence. Now. Leaders in Congress need to step up so that we ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe storage of guns and pass universal background checks and a national red flag law. Enough is enough.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christina_coulter@foxnews.com", "name": "Christina Coulter", "type": "author",

What I did not expect is that you would end the call by asking me what you could do to support the Marshals Service and the Justice Department in this time of immeasurable sadness.\n\nI called hoping to lift your spirits.

But from everything I have heard about him, I know he would be very proud of you.\n\nOver the past several days, I have learned that Tommy loved his family deeply -- his wife, his four children, his father, and his three brothers. I know that no words can adequately describe the pain that you are feeling now, that nothing can undo this horrible loss, and that there is not enough gratitude in the world to recognize the sacrifice that you and your family have made.\n\nI have also learned that Tommy loved his U.S. Marshals Service family. And I know that today, that family is not just grieving for a colleague, but for a friend and a brother.\n\nI also know that despite that grief, the U.S. Marshals family and the entire law enforcement family here in Charlotte, has stepped up to support the Weeks family.\n\nThat is what working in law enforcement means -- it means stepping up and showing up when things are most difficult and most painful. It means facing unacceptable threats and danger. It means supporting people and communities when they are experiencing some of their darkest days. It means putting your life on the line for the public that you serve.\n\nThat is what Tommy did every single day during his career in law enforcement.\n\nThat is what he did during his work with Customs and Border Protection.\n\nAnd that is what he did after joining the U.S. Marshals in 2011. He first worked in Washington, D.C., where he protected the D.C. Superior Court. And where he played on a hockey team alongside other deputy marshals and at least one judge.\n\nThat judge recounted that Tommy always had a smile on his face. The biggest smile. Equally important, the judge said, was that Tommy was the kind of hockey player you always wanted on your side. And the kind of person who the judges were glad to have on their side, protecting them.\n\nWhen Tommy arrived in the Western District of North Carolina, he quickly developed a reputation for being the kind of law enforcement officer, and friend, you could count on.\n\nNo matter what he was doing -- whether it was serving a warrant, protecting the courthouse, or carrying out an extradition in Poland or Colombia -- he gave everything he had to make sure the task was done right.\n\nHe was dependable, reliable, resilient, and passionate about serving his community.\n\nHis colleagues say that he could be intense because he took his work so seriously. He knew how important his job was. And he never gave anything less than 110 %.\n\nBut they also say he could be funny -- in a dry sort of way, as you just heard.\n\nWhen Tommy arrived at the Western District, one colleague commented that he might just be a bit out of shape. Tommy replied: \"Round is a shape.\"\n\nBut Tommy didn't just leave it at that. Instead, he took it as a challenge. He started running the fastest he had ever run -- soon he was running faster than everyone else -- and he pushed his colleagues to constantly be better.\n\nThat was the kind of marshal he was, and the kind of leader he was.\n\nFor all the seriousness he brought to his work, Tommy also brought care and a touch of tenderness to his work family.\n\nWhen a dear friend and a fellow Deputy Marshal became a grandmother, he started calling her meemaw.\n\nWhen a close friend and fellow Deputy Marshal from D.C. was transferred to the Western District, he helped him find a place to live. The friend said it best: \"Tommy would give the shirt off his back to anyone.\"\n\nFor Tommy, serving with the U.S. Marshals Service was a dream job. He was proud to be in a position in which he could inspire others.\n\nAnd as a history buff, he knew that he was part of one of the oldest law enforcement agencies in our country's history.\n\nHe knew that his work to keep his community safe, and to protect the judicial process upon which our democracy depends, was of historic importance.\n\nAs Tommy likely knew, the position of both Attorney General and U.S. Marshal -- together with our federal courts system -- were all created at the same time under President George Washington's administration, as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789.\n\nOur founders recognized that a country based on the rule of law could only survive as long as there were people -- people like Tommy -- willing to defend the institutions that sustain it.\n\nFor more than two decades, I was a federal judge in Washington, D.C., working in another federal courthouse just down the block from where Tommy was working. In fact I think I recognize our bomb dog over there in the corner.\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that federal judges put their lives in the hands of U.S. Marshals. Their service, and their sacrifice, makes it safe for judges to base their decisions on the law, and not on fear.\n\nOur U.S. Marshals reflect the very best of what a public servant should be -- dedicated, selfless, and courageous.\n\nThat is what Tommy did. That is what Tommy was. And that is how he lived his life. And that is how he always will be remembered.\n\nOn April 29, 2024, Tommy made the ultimate sacrifice. He did so along with his colleagues, task force officers Alden Elliott and Samuel Poloche, and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Officer Joshua Eyer.\n\nTheir deaths stand as a stark reminder of the enormous risks our law enforcement officers face every day, even when making the relatively routine arrests they make every day.\n\nEvery day our law enforcement officers go to work knowing that day may be their last. Every day their families send them off to work, praying it will not be.\n\nWhile this community will never be the same without the brave officers we lost on April 29, it will always be safer because of them.\n\nThere is no more honorable legacy than that.\n\nTo the Weeks family: please know that your husband, your father, your son, your brother will always be remembered by this community and by our country as a hero.\n\nAs we remember Tommy Weeks today, and in the days and years ahead, may we never stop working to fulfill the mission to which he dedicated his life.", "source": {"uri":

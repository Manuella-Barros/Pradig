MeteoSchweiz, the government's office for weather and climate, said 124 mm (4.88 inches) of rain fell in Mesolcina valley in the canton of Grisons on Friday, with 63 mm (2.48 inches) falling in a one-hour period.

Three houses and three cars were swept away by water in the village of Sorte, Grisons police said. Two police officers were able to escape from their vehicle which was submerged up to its roof.

A search was still underway for three other people who police said could have been in their homes when the flooding took place. Police urged people not to travel to the region as many roads were closed. Five villages were without electricity. In the western canton of Valais, 230 people were evacuated since Friday after heavy rainfall caused flooding and mudslides.

Now the Tortured Poets Department singer has added a new achievement thanks to her fans, with the best behaved live event. Police revealed that not a single person was arrested at Edinburgh\u2019s Scottish Gas Murrayfield Stadium before, during or directly after Friday\u2019s show. Of the 73,000 crowd, many spent most of the day at the home of Scottish rugby before catching support act Paramore. They then enjoyed a sophisticated set lasting three-and-a-half hours from the main act, Taylor Swift, there with no disturbances. In fact, Swifties were perfectly behaved throughout a concert in which Swift repeatedly praised the crowd as the best she had ever encountered. Despite a potential crisis situation after the show where people found themselves in dangerous bottlenecks around the stadium, eyewitnesses said fans took care to avoid a crush and were concerned for the safety of others. A spokesperson for Police Scotland told The Record: \u201cThere were no arrests at the Taylor Swift concert on Friday, 7 June, 2024.\u201d The opening show had gone without incident and thousands of fans had to walk for up to two hours, some wearing clearly impracticable ( dad alert ) cowboy boots, into the centre of Edinburgh due to the demand for public transport services. Thousands also queued for trams from Murrayfield while others decided to make their own way home. Swift praised the fans during her first show in Scotland since 2015. She said: \u201cI haven\u2019t been in Scotland for almost a decade now. The last time I was here was 10 years ago and I was wondering, what\u2019s it going to be like when I go back to visit them, what are they gonna be like as a crowd? \"And you know what you kinda answered me before I even got on stage because I had someone pull me aside and say \u2018Hey - and we\u2019ve checked this 20 times to make sure that it\u2019s accurate - tonight\u2019s concert is the most highly attended stadium show in Scottish history.\u201d The crowd erupted as Taylor added: \u201cThank you Edinburgh, that\u2019s absolutely the wildest way to welcome a 'lass' to your city.\u201d At one stage she stood awestruck for two full minutes as the crowd gave her an ear shattering roar of approval. The impressive 45 song set list has been organised into 10 sections representing each of her musical eras including Lover, Fearless, Red, Speak Now, Reputation, Folklore/Evermore, 1989, The Tortured Poets Department , Surprise Songs and Midnights. Tonight, she will perform a similar set though the section called Surprise Songs will, as the name suggests, include some unexpected treats. By the end of the tour, Swift will have played 152 Eras shows across 54 cities worldwide, including Liverpool and Cardiff as well as eight Wembley Stadium concerts, all of which sold out almost instantly. Swift said: \"Every time I perform in Scotland it honestly feels like I am coming home.\" ScotRail are urging fans to head straight to Haymarket after the concert if they are planning to get a train home. Phil Campbell, ScotRail Customer Operations Director, said: \"It will be fantastic to see so many people travel to Scottish Gas Murrayfield stadium to see Taylor Swift, and ScotRail is delighted to be able to add more seats and extra late-night trains to help fans enjoy the occasion. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraging customers to plan ahead and allow extra time for travel to and from Edinburgh. Buying return tickets in advance on the ScotRail app or website will minimise your need to queue, and help your day run smoothly.\u201d Don't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "summary": "Now the Tortured Poets Department singer has added a new achievement thanks to her fans, with the best behaved live event.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/taylor-swift-fans-praised-police-32989485", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32989501.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Taylor-Swift-The-Eras-Tour-Edinburgh-Scotland.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:09:42", "author": "John Dingwall", "authors": ["John Dingwall"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.106}

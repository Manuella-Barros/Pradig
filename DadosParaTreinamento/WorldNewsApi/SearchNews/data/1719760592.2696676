Efficient and effective handoffs keep the chain flowing optimally, while dropped batons can cause costly delays and interruptions. Technology platforms have become central to supply chain operations, driving higher levels of efficiency by automating processes and improving control capabilities. However, technology can also make coordination more complex. To truly enhance efficiency, tech platforms must be able to share information in a streamlined way. Application programming interfaces (APIs) build bridges between independent systems that allow for streamlined communication. Consequently, businesses have come to rely on APIs as a key component of modern supply chain strategies. Strengthening Links Through Streamlined Communication The strength of a supply chain is determined by the reliability of its links. APIs facilitate secure links between the various systems that make up the supply chain.

Without an API in place, the delivery details a marketplace collects must be manually entered into the delivery company\u2019s system, significantly stifling the data exchange. APIs have been developed to assist with communications exchange at virtually every phase of the supply chain, including: \u2022 Sharing key port information with transport ship command centers. \u2022 Providing delivery status to customer portals. \u2022 Validating delivery addresses at the point of sale before finalizing delivery orders. Enhancing Transparency With Real-Time Visibility Supply chain logistics improve when companies can proactively address disruptions. APIs can empower a proactive response by providing real-time visibility across the entire chain, tracking the movement of materials and products, recognizing delays as they happen and notifying those who will be impacted. Consumer expectations have evolved in recent years, requiring companies to provide greater transparency in processing and shipping. Reports show that 90% of customers want immediate delivery updates when the status of their order changes. The visibility provided by APIs is essential for companies to meet those expectations. Improving Flexibility And Adaptability Connecting analytics tools to supply chain data is an example of the adaptability APIs can provide. Businesses seeking to better understand performance metrics can utilize APIs that transfer management platform data to analytical platforms. The alternative would be updating management platforms to new systems that provide built-in analytics tools, which can be a costly process and involve system downtime. APIs open a gateway to obtain key data without compromising the efficiency of existing systems. Using APIs to supplement the functionality of key logistics systems also improves flexibility. If API-empowered add-ons don\u2019t perform as expected, they can be quickly removed and replaced by alternatives. Increasing flexibility with APIs decreases the risks of a single component breakdown rippling throughout the entire supply chain. Optimizing Costs With Automation Tools APIs allow information exchange systems to be updated from manual to automated capabilities. This not only increases processing speed but also decreases processing costs. By automating repetitive tasks and processes, APIs minimize employee engagement, allowing logistics companies to do more with less while freeing up resources that can be used for business growth. For example, route optimization APIs facilitate a dynamic process that automatically resources transport teams by drawing upon customer details, product details, traffic data and weather data to determine the best route. If data changes\u2014due to road construction, for example\u2014route optimization APIs can automatically update routes and notify transport teams. Automation tools also improve accuracy in supply chain logistics by ensuring systems are consistent and removing the risk of errors that result from manual processing. Recent reports show that 90% of workers trust automation tools to improve their accuracy and empower faster decision-making. Common Challenges Of Integrating APIs Into The Supply Chain However, as with any new technology, there are certain challenges and best practices that must be considered when adopting APIs for supply chain and logistics management. Due to the nature of APIs, cybersecurity concerns are a common hurdle to overcome. APIs can leave organizations vulnerable to a range of cybersecurity risks, particularly due to their ability to access sensitive internal or client data. If a company integrates an API but fails to properly secure it, this can potentially expose valuable information to hackers or other bad actors. Companies will also need to ensure they prevent sharing certain data with APIs. According to cybersecurity company CybelAngel, \u201cIn 2023, 50% of organizations reported data breaches due to API vulnerabilities, making APIs a major cybersecurity risk for any company...Excessive data exposure in API can have serious ramifications, from loss of sensitive information to a damaged brand reputation to a negative user experience and more.\u201d Additionally, because the interactions between APIs and existing tech stacks can be extremely intricate, companies that integrate them will be challenged in their ability to safeguard their security measures and remain one step ahead of cyber threats and other harmful exploits. With this in mind, companies will need to ask questions about their present tech stack to ensure APIs can be successfully implemented, such as: \u2022 \u201cWhat are our goals for implementing APIs into our current business model?\u201d \u2022 \u201cHow will integrating APIs specifically add value to both our organization and clients?\u201d \u2022 \u201cWill the API or our existing tech stack need to scale as we grow to achieve improved flexibility, performance and cost reduction efforts?\u201d \u2022 \u201cWill the API successfully integrate with our CRM, cloud servers, data access/security tools or any other technologies we currently utilize?\u201d Addressing and answering these questions will likely require companies to either train existing employees or hire new staff to use the APIs they wish to implement. When implemented correctly, APIs have come to play a vital role in supply chain logistics by facilitating the connections needed to optimize the performance of digital tools, giving companies the adaptability they need to take advantage of the latest digital innovations. Exploring the capabilities APIs can deliver is an essential component of a modern supply chain strategy.

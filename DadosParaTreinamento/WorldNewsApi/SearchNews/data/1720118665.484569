Originally from California, she now lives in the Douro Valley of Portugal, her partner works in the wine industry, and she has visited 47 countries, many of which have celebrated viticulture. But seven years ago, on a trip to Mendoza, a winemaking region in the foothills of Argentina\u2019s Andes Mountains, she opted to abstain from drinking alcohol, a decision she would repeat in future travels. \u201cIt\u2019s such a long flight to Argentina, and I was only there for 10 days,\u201d said Snook, 34, a publishing professional. \u201cI\u2019m aware of how alcohol affects me, and I chose to prioritize feeling amazing every day of the trip over dealing with a hangover.\u201d During her visit, Snook bicycled between vineyards, reveled in breathtaking scenery, relaxed with spa treatments and engaged with sommeliers and winemakers, coming away with a new appreciation for sustainable and regenerative agriculture. \u201cThe obvious question when you tell someone that you aren\u2019t drinking is, \u2018Out of all the places you could go, why travel to wine country?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut to me, it makes perfect sense because these regions offer all the perks of luxury travel \u2014 wellness amenities, beautiful landscapes and fine dining.\u201d With 41 percent of Americans seeking to reduce their alcohol intake, according to a consumer-sentiment study released in January by NCSolutions, Snook\u2019s experience is part of a larger trend: the rise of sober-curious or mindful drinking. While sober travel is hardly a new concept, its popularity is surging to new heights \u2014 particularly among younger generations \u2014 and forcing a reckoning in the wine industry. The 2024 State of the U.S. Wine Industry report, an annual forecast of market conditions and trends written by wine-business analyst Rob McMillan, found that 52 percent of consumers ages 21 to 34 believe that consuming alcohol, even in moderation, is bad for your health. This trend is reshaping travel to world-class wine destinations like Sonoma County, in California, as well as Tuscany, in Italy, and Mendoza. Blessed with temperate climates, extended growing seasons, fertile soils, rich histories and breathtaking vistas, these renowned wine locales are expanding their offerings to attract drinkers and nondrinkers. Here are some of the restaurants, tour groups and wineries in those regions that are reinventing the travel experience to be more inclusive of the sober-curious. If wine is a true expression of the land, embodying the unique characteristics of its soil, weather and the meticulous craftsmanship of those who cultivate it, can you still forge that connection without drinking? At Cyrus, a Michelin-starred fine dining destination in Geyserville, California, the answer is a resounding yes. Sonoma County, double the size of neighboring Napa, made conscious decisions to protect and diversify its land use, ensuring grapes as well as agricultural crops were grown. Douglas Keane, Cyrus\u2019 owner and chef, highlights the local harvest by working with small farms and purveyors to source his ingredients. Crosnes \u2014 a Chinese artichoke \u2014 from Alexander Valley Vineyards gardens, yuzu and finger limes from citrus grower David Levine, and cheese from Andante Dairy have all ended up on Cyrus\u2019 menu. Also on the menu: Kally, an alcohol-free wine alternative produced with housemade organic verjuice and sourced from Northern California. Served at more than 15 other Michelin-starred restaurants, Kally\u2019s bottles include Early Chardonnay, which is crisp, bright and changes flavor and aroma as it moves across the palate, similar to a fine wine. A tart, vibrant Golden Sparkler has notes of jasmine and citrus, and a floral, fruity Ros\u00e9 Sparkler offers hints of strawberry and hibiscus. \u201cChefs and sommeliers are interested in having precise nonalcoholic pairings. Their food was created to be prepared with sophisticated drinks, not just sparkling water,\u201d said Scott Mitic, who created the beverage along with his wife, Katie. Customers, too, appreciate having a choice, he said, noting that many of Kally\u2019s most loyal drinkers are wine enthusiasts. \u201cThis is not an abstinence movement; it is a moderation movement,\u201d he said. Cyrus Schultz, wine director and sommelier at Cyrus, aims to create drinks that make sober guests feel just as special, if not more, than those indulging in traditional wine pairings. His nonalcoholic creations include the Ros\u00e9 Champagne, an effervescent blend of coconut, white sesame, cherry blossom and lime, and the Apple Martini, a sweet, herbaceous concoction of pink lady apple, fennel and mint olive oil. \u201cThe intention is never to mimic alcohol products, but to construct the pairings similarly to how a chef looks at a menu \u2014 different textures, temperatures and flavor profiles,\u201d Schultz said. These efforts are not limited to one restaurant. Chris Vomvolakis, senior manager of consumer public relations at Sonoma County Tourism, said bars, restaurants and wineries across the region are recognizing that it\u2019s not all about wine. The town of Healdsburg recently created the Mocktail Trail, with eight participating restaurants, and Meadowcroft Wines in the town of Sonoma curated a flight of original zero-proof cocktails. David Messerli, Meadowcroft\u2019s marketing and strategy director, said the winery encourages guests \u201cto discern aromas, flavors and nuances, much like they would with wine.\u201d \u201cFor those opting out of alcohol, we felt there was more we could do,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have various reasons for abstaining from alcohol, and no one should feel excluded because of it.\u201d Mendoza, renowned for its malbec wines and stunning Andean landscapes, is no stranger to luxury accouterments, but sober guests? That is a newer phenomenon. \u201cWe have definitely noticed an increase in guests seeking nonalcoholic travel options in recent years,\u201d said Victoria Stiles, sales manager at Cavas Wine Lodge, a luxury 18-room hotel set amid a 55-acre vineyard. At Cavas, wine may be the main attraction, but guests can book spa treatments using vine and grape-seed extracts, join yoga sessions on the private terrace overlooking the Andes and vineyards, and take full-day hiking excursions to Aconcagua Provincial Park, a rugged, mountainous destination that is home to Mount Aconcagua, South America\u2019s highest peak. Wild Terrains, a certified B-Corp travel company specializing in experiences for women, has planned three days of a 10-day Argentina tour to be sober-inclusive in Mendoza. Built around women-owned businesses, stops include boutique lodging at Entre Cielos, horseback riding in the Andean foothills, home-cooked asado at Estancia Los Chulengos and a private dining experience at Michelin-starred Zonda Cocina de Paisaje. The meal offers special mocktail pairings with distinct flavors like lemon verbena, beets and burro, an herb used to make digestive teas and infusions. \u201cIn Mendoza, our trip centers on talented female winemakers who are pushing boundaries in a historically male-dominated industry,\u201d said Lauren Bates, founder of Wild Terrains. \u201cWhile these experiences include wine tastings, we want sober travelers to feel intentionally included even if they are skipping the wine tasting.\u201d Sofia Pescarmona, owner of the Bodega Lagarde vineyard and Zonda Cocina de Paisaje, said that while the restaurant experience aims to showcase their wine, nondrinkers will also appreciate it. \u201cWe truly believe we can offer an elevated experience for those who don\u2019t drink wine by highlighting other seasonal produce grown on our property,\u201d she said. Wine tastings epitomize indulgence, especially immersed in the heart of Tuscany, when visitors can savor glass after glass of Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. Salvatore Ferragamo Jr., CEO of the Il Borro wine estate and grandson of the fashion house\u2019s founder, encourages guests to find other ways to indulge. \u201cThe olive harvests in the autumn produce the region\u2019s spicy, piquant \u2018green gold,\u2019\u201d Ferragamo said. Il Borro, in Tuscany\u2019s Valdarno, is a meticulously restored medieval village that includes 58 suites, three vacation villas, two restaurants, stables, working vineyards and olive groves. Olive oil production began in 1996, following the recovery of varieties like Frantoio, Moraiolo and Leccino that had long been neglected. Now, after touring some 80 acres of organic groves, guests can engage in a tasting experience of two distinct oils, one full-bodied with floral, fruity and grassy aromas, the other robust, peppery and dark. Another option, Tuscan Organic Tours, offers immersive daylong experiences that delve into wine and oil but also other rich agricultural offerings. Delicious tours with private transportation highlight tastes and flavors that include Pecorino di Pienza, one of the most renowned Italian cheeses, saffron and fresh pastas. The tours include visits to organic farms, lunches, tastings, and opportunities to participate in cheese-making and saffron harvesting. Chitnis is a freelance writer.

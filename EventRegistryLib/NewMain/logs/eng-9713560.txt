An investigation by The New York Times shows how SpaceX's ferocious growth in the area has dramatically changed the fragile landscape and has threatened the habitat that the U.S. government is charged with protecting there.\n\nMore repercussions are likely coming, in South Texas and in other places where SpaceX is expanding. Musk has said he hopes to one day launch his Starships -- the largest rocket ever manufactured -- 1,000 times a year.\n\nExecutives from SpaceX declined repeated requests to comment. But Gary Henry, who until this year served as a SpaceX adviser on Pentagon launch programs, said the company was aware of concerns about SpaceX's environmental impact and was committed to addressing them.\n\nHere are four takeaways from our investigation:\n\nMusk used preserved lands as a buffer for SpaceX operations\n\nRocket launch sites in the U.S., such as Vandenberg Space Force Base in California and Kennedy Space Center in Florida, typically are enormous, secure facilities with tens of thousands of acres within their confines.\n\nBut there was a wrinkle in that plan. There were several inhabited homes in Boca Chica Village, adjacent to the planned launch site, and there were frequent visitors to the state park. These people would have to be evacuated every time a launch was planned.\n\nMore concerning, the planned launch site was next door to one of the most important migratory bird habitats in North America. And the nearby Boca Chica beach serves as a breeding ground for Kemp's ridleys, the world's most endangered species of sea turtle.\n\nMusk misled officials about his plans for the area\n\nMusk and SpaceX initially told local officials that the company's imprint on the region would be modest. The development would bring the area a few hundred jobs through an investment of about $50 million.\n\nCompany officials also told the Federal Aviation Administration, SpaceX's chief regulator, that they planned to launch their Falcon rockets from the area. The Falcons are the company's workhorses, used primarily to launch satellites into space.\n\nMusk executed an entirely different plan. The investment into SpaceX operations, including a rocket manufacturing facility, now totals $3 billion. A second launchpad is under construction. The industrial growth has caused so much congestion along the tiny two-lane road into Boca Chica that some of the now 3,400 SpaceX employees and contract employees get to work by hovercraft.\n\nSpaceX also began testing Starship, a rocket that dwarfs the largest version of the Falcon and weighs nearly four times as much. As test flights began for the Starship, Musk hailed the advance as a step toward someday sending manned spaceflight to Mars. The FAA initially wasn't expecting operations of this scale or a rocket of this power.\n\nOfficials with the U.S. National Park Service also grew frustrated with SpaceX's failed promises. The company agreed to certain conditions to limit the impact on the nearby Palmito Ranch Battlefield, site of the last Civil War fight. But one park service official, who has since retired, told the Times that SpaceX violated several of those agreements. \"We were being misled,\" the official, Mark Spier, said.\n\nThe public lands surrounding Starbase have been hammered\n\nIn April 2023, SpaceX executed its first full-scale test launch of a Starship. But the rocket malfunctioned, and a self-destruct mechanism eventually caused it to explode. Steel sheets, concrete chunks and shrapnel were hurled thousands of feet into the air, then slammed into the bird habitat as well as onto the nearby state park and beach. One concrete piece was found 2,680 feet from the launch site -- far outside the zone where the FAA had thought damage could occur.\n\nThat was neither the first time nor the last that the protected areas were pelted with debris. On at least 19 occasions since 2019, SpaceX tests of Starship rockets or prototypes caused fires, leaks, explosions or other problems associated with the rapid growth of Musk's complex in Boca Chica, which he calls Starbase.\n\nEven the hovercraft that employees use to commute created what officials at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife described in a letter to SpaceX as new hazards to a \"globally important shorebird area.\"\n\nThe environment took a back seat to SpaceX's and America's ambitions\n\nMusk exploited the limitations and competing missions of the various agencies most poised to be a check on Starbase's expansion.\n\nThose charged with protecting the area's cultural and natural resources -- particularly officials from the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service -- repeatedly lost out to more powerful agencies, including the FAA, whose goals are intertwined with Musk's.\n\nThe United States already depends heavily on SpaceX to launch its defense and commercial satellites into space. The Defense Department and NASA both intend to fly cargo aboard the new Starship. NASA has a $2.9 billion contract to use the rocket to land astronauts on the moon for the first time in more than 50 years.\n\nThe FAA is charged with fostering space travel safely. And even though it is required to do an environmental study of SpaceX's operations, the agency acknowledges that protecting the environment is not its first priority.\n\n\"Blowing debris into state parks or national land is not what we prescribed, but the bottom line is no one got hurt, no one got injured,\" said Kevin Coleman, the top FAA official overseeing space launch licenses. \"We certainly don't want people to feel like they're bulldozed. But it's a really important operation that SpaceX is conducting down there. It is really important to our civilian space program.\"", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Chunks of sheet metal and insulation peppered the sand flats on one side of a state park. Elsewhere, a small fire had ignited, leaving a charred patch of grasslands.\n\nNone of the nine nests recorded by the nonprofit Coastal Bend Bays & Estuaries Program before the launch had survived intact.\n\nEgg yolk stained the ground.\n\nThe outcome was part of a well-documented pattern.\n\nOn at least 19 occasions since 2019, SpaceX operations have caused fires, leaks, explosions or other problems associated with the rapid growth of Musk's complex in Boca Chica. These incidents have caused environmental damage and reflect a broader debate over how to balance technological and economic progress against protections of delicate ecosystems and local communities.\n\nThat natural tension is heightened by Musk's influence over U.S. space aspirations. Members of Congress and senior officials in the Biden administration have fretted privately and publicly about the extent of Musk's power as the U.S. government increasingly relies on SpaceX for commercial space operations and for its plans to travel to the moon and even Mars.\n\nAn examination of Musk's tactics in South Texas shows how he exploited the limitations and competing missions of the various agencies most poised to be a check on the expansion of the industrial complex he calls Starbase. Those charged with protecting the area's cultural and natural resources -- particularly officials from the Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service -- repeatedly lost out to more powerful agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration, whose goals are intertwined with Musk's.\n\nIn the end, South Texas' ecology took a back seat to SpaceX's -- and the country's -- ambitions.\n\nExecutives from SpaceX declined repeated requests in person and via email to comment. But Gary Henry, who until this year served as a SpaceX adviser on Pentagon launch programs, said the company was aware of the officials' complaints about environmental impact and was committed to addressing them.\n\nKelvin B. Coleman, the top FAA official overseeing space launch licenses, said he was convinced that his agency was doing its duty, which is to foster space travel safely.\n\n\"Blowing debris into state parks or national land is not what we prescribed, but the bottom line is no one got hurt, no one got injured,\" Coleman said in an interview.\n\nThe conflict in South Texas is likely to have echoes at SpaceX's other launch sites in California and Florida as the company increases the frequency of its launches, and with Starship, the size of its rockets.\n\nThis account is based on more than 10,000 pages of emails and other state and federal records made public through open records requests, court filings and federal disclosures, as well as interviews with more than two dozen local, federal and state officials overseeing the project.\n\nThese records reveal how SpaceX over time expanded its operations in South Texas to a scale far grander than Musk had first promised.\n\n\"They kept saying, 'No, we are not going to do that, we are not going to do that,' and then they came back and said, 'Yes, we are,'\" said Mark Spier, who served as the top local official for the National Park Service when the SpaceX project got underway. \"We were being misled.\"\n\nMusk and the company had pledged a different sensibility when setting up operations in Boca Chica. The project, SpaceX told local officials, would have a \"small, eco-friendly footprint\" in which the the \"surrounding area is left untouched,\" meaning it \"provides for an excellent wildlife habitat.\"\n\nBut from the start, according to interviews with executives involved in SpaceX's land purchase, Musk's plan was to use federal and state lands alongside the small piece of property the company initially purchased, knowing that rocket mishaps would likely send debris flying.\n\n\"We've got a lot of land with nobody around and so if it blows up, it's cool,\" Musk said at a 2018 news conference.\n\nA Small Start\n\nWhen Musk started talking about his desire to build a spacecraft to Mars, the area near Brownsville, Texas, was an attractive option.\n\nIts location at one of the United States' most southern points would allow rockets easier access to orbit, as Musk could use the Earth's faster rotation closer to the equator as a slingshot to get into space. The sparsely populated area was known to be pro-business, with few regulations that might hinder construction.\n\nBy April 2011, SpaceX representatives were secretly scouring land records in Cameron County to look for the perfect spot, said Gilberto Salinas, then a Brownsville economic development executive.\n\nThe piece of private property they eyed was encircled primarily by government-owned state parks and federal wildlife refuge areas where nothing could be built. Still, residents lived in close-by Boca Chica Village and tourists routinely visited the state parks. Musk's plan would require an evacuation of the parks and residential areas for every launch.\n\nThis part of Texas is protected as an important bird habitat. Nearly 500 species of birds have been documented here, including rare or threatened ones. The nearby Boca Chica beach also serves as a breeding ground for the world's most endangered species of sea turtle, the Kemp's ridley.\n\nMusk presented a plan to local and federal officials to use Boca Chica as another launch site for SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, which was starting to regularly launch from Florida and California. The Falcon 9 would soon become the most popular way for the U.S. government and commercial companies to get satellites to orbit.\n\nIn Texas, the company initially told officials any construction for this third Falcon 9 launch site would be modest, costing only about $50 million and creating about 150 jobs.\n\nPrivately, Musk was already planning something much bigger, according to interviews and documents obtained by the Times. SpaceX was aiming to use this corner of Texas to launch a rocket like the world had never seen.\n\nStarship, as this new rocket would be called, dwarfs the largest version of the Falcon and weighs nearly four times as much. Its first-stage engines produce an extraordinary 16.7 million pounds of thrust -- more than double the output of the first stage of the Saturn V rocket that powered NASA's Apollo moon missions.\n\nThe FAA conducted an environmental impact study for the site, but it was premised on Musk's original proposal to use Falcon rockets at the location.\n\nAfter the Starship plans became public, FAA officials told a local group that they planned to conduct a new environmental impact assessment for the project. But the agency decided instead to modify the old one.\n\nMost fundamentally, the FAA decided it could legally consider the environmental impact of the launchpad operations and its control center, but not the rocket factory nearby.\n\nThe FAA's legal decision was critical. The launchpad eventually became just a small piece of SpaceX's overall rocket manufacturing and testing facilities, now spread over approximately 350 acres the company acquired over time.\n\nIn the end, the FAA determined that SpaceX's activities were unlikely to jeopardize the \"continued existence\" of any threatened species or harm critical habitat.\n\nDefying the FAA\n\nThe sun was preparing to set on a December 2020 afternoon in Boca Chica when SpaceX began the countdown for a Starship prototype ready for its first high-altitude launch.\n\nThe test vehicle slowly lifted off the ground until it reached a height of about 8 miles. It then turned horizontally and began a controlled descent in anticipation of a gentle landing.\n\nInstead, it exploded into a giant fireball, blasting pieces of the rocket across the area.\n\nThe launch violated a federal order.\n\nSpaceX launched the rocket after being told explicitly by the FAA to hold back. The agency had outstanding concerns that the launch might cause a shock wave that could damage homes even far from the launch site.\n\nFish and Wildlife officials were furious. In emails, they began to question if the FAA was effectively conspiring with SpaceX to undermine their work in protecting the area.\n\nNeither SpaceX nor the FAA have \"authorization under the Endangered Species Act for the testing activities they are engaging in,\" Dawn Gardiner, a Fish and Wildlife assistant field supervisor, wrote in an email to her bosses a few days after the incident.\n\nThe FAA's top administrator at the time did have a 30-minute call with Musk after the unauthorized launch in December 2020 and \"made it clear that the FAA expects SpaceX to develop and foster a robust safety culture that stresses adherence to FAA rules,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nBut the FAA let SpaceX conduct its own investigation into the improper launch. The agency also refused to make the results of the inquiry public, or even provide them to Fish and Wildlife officials, because they contained sensitive commercial information about SpaceX.\n\nCapitulation\n\nThe FAA, in a statement to the Times, said the agency \"is dedicated to ensuring all voices are heard so that an appropriate balance can be found between environmental protection and our future in space.\"\n\nThe pattern established in Boca Chica explains why environmentalists elsewhere have expressed skepticism of the FAA's stance.\n\nEven when SpaceX was publicly discussing using only Falcon rockets in Boca Chica, the company had told the FAA that it intended to install what is known as a flame diverter system to prevent damage to the launchpad and mute the rocket's roar. During a launch, the system was to pump as much as 200,000 gallons of water into the rocket exhaust plume.\n\nIn fact, no such system had been finished -- or been given permits by Texas to operate by the first full-scale test launch of Starship in spring 2023.\n\nSpaceX went ahead with the test anyway.\n\nThe problems started as soon as the first stage engines ignited. The energy they created pulverized the launchpad, ripping up the concrete base and then digging a large crater under the platform.\n\nSteel sheets, concrete chunks and shrapnel flew thousands of feet into the air, then slammed into the bird habitat, the nearby state park and the beach. The rocket then malfunctioned and started to go off course before an automated self-destruct system caused it to explode.\n\nSeveral days later, after being allowed to inspect the damage, Fish and Wildlife sent a request to the FAA to \"discuss noise, temperature and vibration levels associated with the launch,\" emails show.\n\nThe FAA opened a mishap investigation -- again relying on SpaceX and its consultants to do most of the work.\n\nBy late last summer, Musk had begun a pressure campaign to force the FAA to rapidly authorize him to launch again.\n\nThe company sent one of its top executives -- a former NASA official, William Gerstenmaier -- to Washington to testify before the Senate to complain about how long Starship's approvals were taking and to urge accelerated environmental reviews.\n\nThe FAA generated a list of 63 corrective actions for SpaceX to address the problems from the April 2023 mishap, including installing a flame diverter. SpaceX agreed to them, and the agency ultimately gave the green light.\n\nFish and Wildlife also capitulated. It signed off on the changes just a few days before Starship's second launch in November.\n\nThat did not end the agency's battles with SpaceX.\n\nFish and Wildlife has begun an investigation into the damage to the nest eggs from the June launch, said Aubry Buzek, an agency spokesperson.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Fires have broken out after rocket launches, and mud and trash have cut through and tarnished the area. It's left bird nests destroyed, eggs missing, and federal officials angry.\n\nRecords observed by the Times showed that Musk and his SpaceX team took advantage of the federal bureaucracy to expand the company's headquarters in Boca Chica, playing the purposes of various federal agencies against each other to limit oversight on some issues -- like wildlife management -- while advancing the interests of others, like aviation and space exploration.\n\n\"They kept saying, 'No, we are not going to do that, we are not going to do that,' and then they came back and said, 'Yes, we are,'\" Mark Spier, the then-top National Park Service official who oversaw the SpaceX expansion. \"We were being misled.\"\n\nThe company had apparently promised to have a \"small, eco-friendly footprint\" in the community, vowing to protect the surrounding wildlife habitat. That promise was eventually broken, as Musk had always planned to use the surrounding federal and state lands surrounding the purchased land as landing areas for rocket debris, according to the Times.\n\nStill, the Federal Aviation Administration defended Musk's use of the land, arguing the ecological impact didn't outweigh the benefits of commercial space exploration.\n\n\"Blowing debris into state parks or national land is not what we prescribed, but the bottom line is no one got hurt, no one got injured,\" Kelvin B. Coleman, who oversees space launch licenses for the agency, told the Times. \"We certainly don't want people to feel like they're bulldozed. But it's a really important operation that SpaceX is conducting down there. It is really important to our civilian space program.\"\n\nMusk and Space X were recently sued by eight employees, alleging they had been dismissed after they wrote an open letter complaining that Musk's behavior \"in the public sphere is a frequent source of distraction and embarrassment,\" adding that Musk \"runs his company in the dark ages -- treating women as sexual objects to be evaluated on their bra size, bombarding the workplace with lewd sexual banter, and offering the reprise to those who challenge the 'Animal House' environment that if they don't like it they can seek employment elsewhere.\"", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Habitat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureaucracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Park Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentally_friendly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmentally friendly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_launch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space launch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelvin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2300,w_4089,x_0,y_167/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1720368228/GettyImages-1242718802_qjq5of", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713560", "eventUri": "eng-9713560", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

But, it eventually gave the green signal.\n\nThe rocket's liftoff resulted in a massive release of mud, rocks, and burning debris over the adjacent public lands. Debris such as sheet metal and insulation was scattered across the sand flats, while a fire ignited by the 7.5 million pounds of fuel scorched the grasslands in a section of the park.\n\nOne particularly distressing discovery was a yellow stain on the ground where a bird's nest had previously been located, now marked with egg yolk, indicating the severe disruption caused by the launch on the local wildlife.\n\nThis incident is not an isolated case but part of a series of documented events since 2019.\n\nSpaceX activities in Boca Chica have led to numerous issues, including fires, leaks, explosions, and other incidents, raising concerns about the environmental impact of Musk's expanding operations in the area.\n\nThe broader discussion centers on the fine line between technological and economic advancement and the preservation of fragile ecosystems and communities. While SpaceX's achievements in space exploration are undeniably impressive, the environmental toll on the surrounding areas cannot be overlooked.\n\nAgencies have raised concerns about congestion in Boca Chica, where heavy traffic on the two-lane road prompted SpaceX to build a hovercraft shuttle for employees.\n\nThis solution, however, created new hazards for a vital shorebird area, as noted by Fish and Wildlife officials.\n\nAs part of a wildlife monitoring plan, SpaceX partnered with Sea Turtle Inc. to monitor and relocate turtle eggs and hired a consultant to track bird patterns.\n\nDespite SpaceX's findings of minimal impact on bird populations, data from the Coastal Bend group showed a 54% decline in the piping plover population by 2021.\n\nElon Musk has, however, expressed pride in the transformation of Boca Chica, where 3,400 workers arrive daily in an area with no public amenities, calling the sophisticated factory on a sandbar by the Rio Grande \"like an

That latest launch, the newspaper notes, resulted in charred grasslands, strewn sheet metal and insulation, and the destruction of all nine of the recorded bird nests nearby. Apparently that sort of devastation occurs during many of the rocket's launches.\n\nAccording to George Nield, a former top FAA space official who now runs his own private commercial space enterprise, SpaceX is merely \"leveraging\" federally-protected land. However, the US Fish and Wildlife Service has sometimes considered the company's launches overly destructive to nearby habitats and has used its powers to slow the company's progress.\n\n\"What can we do to maximize SpaceX's bold, grand vision?\" Nield recalled to the NYT. \"Fish and Wildlife has a mission. But it was different from ours and it did not include a lot of rockets.\"\n\nAll the same, the FAA did famously order SpaceX not to undertake a Starship launch in December 2020 -- though when Musk flagrantly violated that order, the agency allowed SpaceX to conduct its own investigation into what happened and did not, as the paper notes, make the results of that self-probe public.\n\nThough Fish and Wildlife has, too, ended up signing off on SpaceX's exploits, it has seemingly ended up acting as the enforcer even as the FAA has repeatedly granted the company pardons, the NYT's investigation demonstrates.\n\nWith the two agencies seemingly at odds, SpaceX has, clearly, gotten the upper hand -- and with Musk bragging that he wants to build 1,000 Starships within the next decade, the local environment in Boca Chica is slated to be the biggest loser.", "source": {"uri": "futurism.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Futurism"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Rio_Grande_Valley", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lower Rio Grande Valley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falcon 9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmental degradation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_assessment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmental impact assessment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Habitat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_insulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thermal insulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheet metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grassland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Fish_and_Wildlife_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Fish and Wildlife Service"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Pyrotechnics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Pyrotechnics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wordpress-assets.futurism.com/2024/07/investigation-elon-musk-rocket-testing.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713560", "eventUri": "eng-9713560", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-", "textStart": 2020, "textEnd": 2033}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The most recent was a Sunday article in The New York Times claiming that the local ecosystem has been harmed by Starbase Boca Chica operations. There was a particular mention of a yellow stain on the ground where a bird's nest had been the day prior. Now, CEO Elon Musk has made the decision to atone in his own peculiar way for this \"heinous crime\".\n\nWell, it all began when reporter Mike Pesca criticised a piece published in NYT on X. The journalist criticised the newspaper for elevating the launch's destruction of many bird nests to the status of the \"most important\" story of the day.\n\nAs per Pesca's explanation of the Times typeface, the article at the top right is the lead, the story at the top left is the sub-lead and the main news of the day is \"everything else above the fold.\" According to him, the rising pressure from prominent congressional Democrats to remove Biden from the campaign is the second most significant story in today's newspaper.\n\nAn unexpected outcome of the French election that completely shocked everyone is the third most significant news. \"The MOST important story is Elon Musk's successful space launch destroying nine bird nests.\"\n\nElon Musk reposted the tweet, writing, \"To make up for this heinous crime, I will refrain from having omelette for a week.\"\n\nThe SpaceX CEO's retweet has more than 6 million views on the social media platform.\n\nA user in the comments section highlighted saying, \"They also apparently buried the story about Boeing being fined for negligently causing multiple plane crashes that killed hundreds,\" to which Musk agreed.\n\nAnother user humourously mentioned, \"NINE BIRD NESTS!?!? HOW COULD YOU ELON???\"\n\nA third user suggested, \"Nah eat even more eggs to spite them.\"\n\nApart from all the fun and games, SpaceX operations have been linked to at least \"19 explosions, fires, leaks and other issues\" since 2019, according to a report by NYT.

Despite internal audits and complaints to executives, including SpaceX's president Gwynne Shotwell, the plaintiffs argue that their concerns were ignored, and their activism for a better work environment led to their dismissals.\n\nFormer executives at SpaceX supported the lawsuit and have indicated that Musk's behavior was facilitated by lax enforcement of company policies, contributing to a culture of sexism and harassment.\n\nWhen asked for comments, Shotwell countered these assertions, stating that the company thoroughly investigates all harassment complaints and takes necessary actions in response.\n\nElon Musk has yet to comment on the issue.", "source": {"uri": "vcpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Venture Capital Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thea_felicity@vcpost.com", "name": "Thea Felicity", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternities_and_sororities", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraternities and sororities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_dismissal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful dismissal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwynne_Shotwell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gwynne Shotwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostile_work_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostile work environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://data.vcpost.com/data/thumbs/full/106659/620/0/0/0/ex-spacex-employee-alleges-frat-boy-culture-and-drinking-games-at-work.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713560", "eventUri": "eng-9713560", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Its two stages are SpaceX's Super Heavy booster rocket, and the upper stage spacecraft known somewhat confusingly as Starship or \"Ship,\" on which a crew of up to 100 astronauts could someday fly.\n\nHaving undergone testing over the past few years, the design of the Starship/Super Heavy has undergone a number of revamps, with the latest resulting in a rocket that will stand up to 492 feet (150 meters) tall. To put this into context, the Saturn V was 363 feet (111 meters) tall, while the crewed version of NASA's new Space Launch System stands 322 feet 98 meters high. SpaceX's rocket is enormous, and the plan is for it to ferry astronauts to the moon and Mars.\n\nBefore SpaceX can get a license to commence launches from launchpad 39A at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, an environmental impact statement must be provided that details what effects SpaceX's launches would have on the local environment and wildlife, as well as neighboring business and residents. This is done so by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and it is currently in the consultation phase, where local businesses, organizations and members of the public can provide their say as to the pros and cons of SpaceX's plans. And, well, SpaceX's rivals haven't held back.\n\nBlue Origin submitted a 3-page letter to the FAA, in which they ask for a cap to be put into place on the number of launches and landings, reducing the 44 planned launches to an unspecified amount \"that has a minimal impact on the local environment, locally operating personnel and the local community,\" they wrote.\n\nThe Blue Origin objections also raise the point that the Starship-Super Heavy will hold \"an unprecedented\" 5,200 metric tons of liquid methane fuel, which is highly flammable and, should something go wrong, could create a devastating explosion on the launch pad. Blue Origin claims that the safety margins are so wide that they overlap with the launch pads, hangars and offices of several other companies, including Blue Origin themselves on launch pad 36, all of which are leased from the Kennedy Space Center.\n\nULA's criticisms hit even harder in a 22-page document that the company submitted as part of the consultation. They don't hold back, accusing SpaceX of producing their own environmental impact statement for their extravagantly named 'Starbase' at Boca Chica in Texas from where they have been testing Starship so far.\n\nIn the letter, ULA points out that SpaceX's environmental impact statement suggested that debris from any mishap on launch would only cover a square mile (2.5 sq km). In April 2023, during Starship's first test flight, debris was scattered instead over a 6-mile (9.6-km) radius, endangering the surrounding area and showing just how much SpaceX had underestimated the danger to their surroundings. The explosion led to environmental groups bringing a lawsuit against SpaceX and the FAA, which was eventually dismissed in court. At Kennedy, ULA's base is located only 3 miles (4.8 km) from SpaceX's launch pad 39A, which makes them understandably nervous.\n\n\"With the increased liftoff thrust planned for Starship, the debris from a similar launch failure could reach larger, populated areas surrounding KSC,\" said ULA, whose recommendation is that SpaceX launch Starship from Boca Chica instead.\n\n\"As the largest rocket in existence,\" wrote ULA, \"an accident would inflict serious or even catastrophic damage, while normal launch operations would have a cumulative impact on structures, launch vehicle hardware and other critical launch support equipment.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Blue Origin suggested that the Government build new launchpads farther away from 39A for those companies such as themselves that could potentially be affected by SpaceX's Starship operations.\n\nThere was also much concern for the environment and local wildlife. To achieve the aim of 44 launches per year, there would need to be at least 3 or 4 launches per month, resulting in launchpad 39A being in use year-round. The Merritt Island Wildlife Association (Merritt Island is the peninsula on which the Kennedy Space Center is found) pointed out that floodlights will be on almost all the time at 39A that will disrupt the natural rhythms of wildlife, for example by sending migrating birds astray.\n\nMeanwhile, the Defenders of Wildlife organization in Florida point out that near Boca Chica, the eggs of nesting birds were cracked by falling granular debris resulting from Starship's previous test flights. Birds are known to nest near launch pad 39A, and more frequent launches would harm the bird population in the area. However, the Defenders of Wildlife do state their belief that using 39A is better than building brand-new launch sites on undeveloped ground near Kennedy Space Center, as proposed by Blue Origin, which would also have a great environmental impact.\n\nA wide-ranging New York Times investigation published June 8 details the environmental damage SpaceX's operations at Boca Chica have caused, noting that the damage has sparked a debate \"over how to balance technological and economic progress against protections of delicate ecosystems and local communities.\" While FAA leadership is aware of the environmental issues Starship is causing, the agency has also stressed that the vehicle is vital for America's space program.\n\n\"Blowing debris into state parks or national land is not what we prescribed, but the bottom line is no one got hurt, no one got injured,\" The FAA's Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation Kelvin B. Coleman told the New York Times. \"We certainly don't want people to feel like they're bulldozed. But it's a really important operation that SpaceX is conducting down there. It is really important to our civilian space program.\"\n\nIt's not just wildlife that could be affected by Starship. SpaceX's water deluge system sprays a million gallons of water onto the pad during launch to protect it from damage during launch by absorbing much of the heat. While much of this water is vaporized, the rest runs off into collection ponds around the launch site. ULA questions whether and how this water will be treated for any toxic or otherwise hazardous chemicals in it, and what will prevent it from leaking out into the water supply at large.\n\nSpaceX also has their eye on a second launch pad, having inquired about use of launch complex 37 from 2026 onwards on the neighboring Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The U.S. Air Force is conducting its own environmental study of this proposal before granting permission.\n\nULA also questions SpaceX's decision to stop using offshore drone ships to land the Super Heavy booster on, and to instead land them back on 39A, which they say \"shifts the risks of a system failure onto the communities, businesses, and environment that surround KSC.\"\n\nAll three companies are competing for the same NASA contracts, and some observers might see these complaints as sour grapes from SpaceX's rivals who are struggling to keep up with them. SpaceX's Elon Musk responded in a seemingly mocking fashion to Blue Origin's complaint on social media, posting \"Sue Origin\" on X (the social media company he owns) in the days following the company's letter.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\n-- SpaceX, FAA seek to dismiss environmental groups' Starship lawsuit\n\n-- SpaceX teases catching Super Heavy booster with 'chopsticks' on upcoming Starship test flight (video)\n\n-- SpaceX joining FAA to fight environmental groups' Starship lawsuit: report\n\nHowever, whatever the motivations behind the complaints, many of them relating to safety and environmental impact do seem pertinent. Even NASA have misgivings; space agency officials have previously stated that an incident at the launch pad could effectively cut NASA off from their only means of reaching the International Space Station, which would leave astronauts stranded.\n\nBoth Blue Origin's and ULA's objections to Starship operations at KSC come down to the two companies believing that the rocket is too untested, too dangerous and too disruptive to fit into the ecosystem of the other users of the Kennedy Space Center.\n\nHowever, it will be up to the FAA to decide whether such concerns are valid, and whether they are enough to prevent Elon Musk and SpaceX from fulfilling their Starship dreams.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The 400-foot-tall rocket will eventually make life interplanetary; at least, that is the goal of SpaceX.\n\nHowever, Starship is still undergoing its routine test flights, and it performed its first on April 20, 2023, with Integrated Test Flight 1, also known as IFT-1. It lasted roughly four minutes total, as SpaceX initiated the flight termination system, which destroyed the vehicle roughly 40 seconds after it was initiated.\n\nSpaceX Starship completes first successful test flight\n\nThen, in November, IFT-2 lasted eight minutes and fifty-five seconds before filter blockages caused several booster engines to shut down. Once again, the flight termination system was initiated as it reached an altitude of roughly 148 kilometers.\n\nIFT-3 occurred in March, lasted over 49 minutes, and disintegrated before a planned splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The booster was eventually destroyed about 462 meters above the ocean.\n\nIFT-4 took place in June and was SpaceX's most successful Starship mission yet.

Musk Takes A Dig At NYT Story On SpaceX Launch Sabotaging 9 Bird Nests", "body": "Cheap coming from a billionaire who wanna make humans a multiplanetary species\n\nA scathing new New York Times report on SpaceX's impact on local wildlife and environment claims that some of the evidence of harm was kept a secret by the Elon Musk-led space agency. The NYT gathered a cache of a whopping 10,000 pages+ documents through several sources including government filings, lawsuits, FOIA etc. One of the visuals showed the extent of fire damage caused by the SpaceX launches near the Boca Chica launch site in Texas. The launches have caused disturbance to the local flora and fauna, that has been by and large ignored. The investigative reporter showed egg yolk stains on the ground from the destroyed nests of migratory birds. The article states nine nests were destroyed by an earlier launch, as recorded by a team of Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries Program. You can read the devastating account here.\n\nReacting to the NYT coverage as shared by a user on X/Twitter, Mr Musk jibed that he would refrain from having omlette for a week \"to make up for this heinous crime.\" He further slammed the publisher for burying the Boeing story, that saw several fatalities and casualties. Musk's dig at NYT has sparked a debate on what is fundamental to human existence. Mulling over a few birds killed by a rocket launch or the starving children in Africa? These are false equivalencies. Taking care of em birbs during a rocket launch is as important as feeding a starving kid in Africa. Dear Musk, maybe you can start your multi-planetary dreams by taking care of the ones back at home planet.\n\nSee Also: Elon Musk Who Claims Crashing At Friend's Place Secretly Bought A $4.5 Million House; Here's Why\n\nSee Also: Why Make Life Multiplanetary?

According to CHSN, the network is in the midst of building its staff and will have continued announcements through the summer as distribution and other agreements are finalized.", "source": {"uri": "wgntv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WGN-TV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_johnson@wgntv.com", "name": "Michael Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_Rate_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guaranteed Rate Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrestrial television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhode Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rhode Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Resources_and_Networking", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Resources and Networking", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Installation", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Installation", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://wgntv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/06/gettyimages-1481512849-594x594-1.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620974", "eventUri": "eng-9620974", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

They do have a name for the network, the Chicago Sports Network (CHSN), which will be in partnership with Standard Media Group.\n\nPretty much everything else is unknown, including the name of the channel, the talent and how to watch.\n\nWith so many things unclear about this new channel, let's lay out the biggest questions remaining.\n\nThe free over-the-air broadcast will be the biggest selling point for the new channel ... if you can find it.\n\nAll TVs since 2006 have been mandated to have digital tuners, but they still require an antenna to watch over-the-air programming. Your TV may already have a built-in antenna, but not all TVs include that. So, that would require purchasing one.\n\nOnce you've sorted out the antenna issue, you'll have to find how to get to it on your TV. Your best bet will probably be to search on the internet how to do it with your specific TV. The process typically includes your TV scanning for channels that your antenna can pick up in your location. There are plenty of tutorials on YouTube and elsewhere.\n\nThe teams expect carriage with most cable providers, but the biggest hurdle will be Comcast, the biggest cable provider in Chicago. One of the main upsides to the team broadcasting on NBC Sports Chicago (originally called Comcast SportsNet Chicago) was that Comcast carried them and the channel wasn't placed in the most expensive cable tier. Going by Comcast's recent negotiations with Bally Sports, this could be a challenge for the new channel.\n\nWhile fewer people subscribe to Comcast than years ago, it remains a vital platform in the Chicago area, and it'll certainly be a priority for the three teams. The Cubs launched Marquee without carriage on Comcast and reached an agreement only right before the pandemic-delayed Opening Day 2020.\n\nIt doesn't sound like an option anytime soon. The Cubs needed three years to launch that for Marquee, but you would think it's a priority.\n\nThe Vegas Golden Knights might have provided an ideal road map. The Golden Knights' broadcasts are available over the air through a deal with Scripps Sports, but they also created a stream-only option, which began this past year. Fans can pay $69.99 for the season to stream all 69 locally broadcasted games.\n\nOf course, the Blackhawks will have national games on TNT or ESPN. In the past, the Blackhawks were allowed to locally broadcast some games that were also broadcast nationally, so it'll be interesting to see how the Blackhawks and the league navigate that as the NHL will want to put Connor Bedard in front of a national audience more often.\n\nThe Bulls and White Sox? Not so much. The networks aren't exactly clamoring for the Jerry Reinsdorf-owned teams.\n\nIt's likely easier to watch the Blackhawks if you're outside the market by simply paying for each league's broadcast service (NHL Center Ice/ESPN+, MLB.TV, NBA League Pass). As long as you're outside the local market, you won't be blacked out from locally broadcast Blackhawks games -- and the same goes for the Bulls and White Sox with the NBA and MLB packages.\n\nChanges to the in-game broadcasts are unlikely because the teams employ those people. The teams will have more of a say now on the studio talent. It would be logical for the teams to try to gather up a lot of the people who worked at NBC Sports Chicago, but that's not a given. The Cubs decided to bring in many new faces when they went on their own, but in some cases, they didn't have much of a choice as some people decided to stay at NBC.\n\nThe network has hired Jason Coyle to be its president. He was previously the president of Stadium. That might bring some clarity to the direction.\n\n\"As we set out to design the network, we began and ended every discussion with the simple question: What is best for our fans?\" Coyle said in a statement. \"What is the best approach to distribution? How can we push the limits of both in-game and studio production? We plan to serve our fans on as many platforms and in as many markets as our rights allow.\"\n\nFormer White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen should be able to command a nice payday. He's in a Charles Barkley position as the main attraction of the Sox's pregame and postgame shows. He and host Chuck Garfien are much more enjoyable than the actual product. The Bulls' trio of Jason Goff, Will Perdue and Kendall Gill are also excellent.\n\nAs for the Bulls' in-game broadcasters, Adam Amin and Stacey King are keepers for the Bulls. They bring honesty and entertainment to a mediocre product. Meanwhile, new White Sox play-by-play broadcaster John Schriffen is off to a pretty rough start. How long will Steve Stone want to continue doing games? The Sox booth could be due for a shakeup with a new network.\n\nThe Blackhawks will undoubtedly try to keep some of their in-studio team together. Caley Chelios is employed by the team and has gotten more comfortable in the past few seasons. Pat Boyle has always been well-liked by fans and has demonstrated he can even carry a show by himself if needed. Charlie Roumeliotis has emerged as a multi-faceted reporter, including in the studio. Tony Granato is knowledgeable and seemed comfortable in the studio. The Blackhawks weren't happy with what John Scott said about the Corey Perry exit, but fans seemed to like Scott's honesty.\n\nIf the network is launched in October, as noted in Monday's annoucement, it won't be ready for the start of the Blackhawks' preseason schedule. That may not be a huge issue in the big picture, but it would have been odd last season if Connor Bedard made his preseason debut and no one saw it. The Blackhawks' No. 2 draft pick this year probably won't start in the NHL, but if he does, they'd probably like to show him in the preseason, too.\n\nInfomercials, probably. In the waning days of NBC Sports Chicago, the channel cut most of the additional programming aside from Bears shows. (Expect NBC to continue to cover the Bears, especially with all the buzz around the team.) But aside from ads, an alignment with Stadium, which has a handful of national shows, will fill the extra hours on the new channel. Right now, the Reinsdorf-owned network is partnered with Marquee, but that's expected to change. We wouldn't expect a ton of documentaries. Could they bring back David Kaplan and his old reporters' roundtable show?\n\nThat's how it works, usually. In talking to NBC Sports Chicago reporters and camera operators in recent months, they've been waiting for news just like everyone else.\n\nOnce the Cubs left and NBC started de-emphasizing local sports, this was bound to happen. The NBC Sports Chicago crew was tight-knit and put out good work over two decades. But there have been layoffs and firings for years leading up to this moment. Hopefully, the good people who are still employed find homes at the new network.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Marquee also has regional rights to the NFL's Chicago Bears as well as WNBA team Chicago Sky and MLR franchise Chicago Hounds.\n\nNBCU has largely been downplaying the RSN portion of its business, including not including them in the lower tiers of its parent company Comcast's pay TV packages.", "source": {"uri": "newscaststudio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewscastStudio"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Blackhawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Blackhawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_sports_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Regional sports network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_General", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Standard General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquee_Sports_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marquee Sports Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Rugby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Rugby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_Rate_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guaranteed Rate Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pay television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Sports", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Resources_and_Networking", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Resources and Networking", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.newscaststudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/chicago-sports-network-preview.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620974", "eventUri": "eng-9620974", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

The Red Sox's NESN regional cable channel carries the Bruins and the Celtics in baseball's off-season, while the Yankees' YES is the home to the NBA's Brooklyn Nets.\n\nIn Chicago, the NBA property was off limits to Ricketts, as White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf also owns the Bulls, but the Blackhawks were fair game. It turns out that some loyalties are tough to get past, however.\n\nThe Blackhawks and White Sox remain seemingly joined at the hip, in a business relationship that goes back to 1994, when Reinsdorf and the late Bill Wirtz formed a 50/50 partnership named the UC Joint Venture. Together they built the United Center on the west side of Chicago, replacing their ancient home, the Chicago Stadium.\n\nOn Monday, it was confirmed that the White Sox, Bulls and Blackhawks are creating their own regional network, named the Chicago Sports Network. All three teams had contracts with NBC Sports Chicago -- Comcast Sports Chicago changed its name in 2017 -- that expired in October.\n\nWhile the new venture will have year-round live programming from MLB, NBA and NHL teams, Marquee continues to add content to make it more relevant in the off-season.\n\nIt has become something of a Midwest pioneer in carrying women's sports, including the WNBA's Chicago Sky and the NWSL's Chicago Red Stars (with Laura Ricketts in the ownership group), and also carries select DePaul University events and the Chicago Hounds of Major League Rugby.\n\nReinsdorf meanwhile was well positioned to engineer the launch of a new station. His sports spin-off, Silver Chalice, has operated Stadium sports from headquarters at the United Center since 2017.\n\nThe White Sox, Bulls and Blackhawks are in a partnership with Nashville-based Standard Media to find the best ways to get their games onto the air, complete with pre- and post-game programming. None of the three franchises are considered championship contenders but the Blackhawks feature one of the NHL's rising stars in 18-year-old Connor Bedard. He is likely to be the most heavily marketed player by the network.\n\nJason Coyle, who had been president of Stadium, was named president of the new network.\n\nThe teams issued a statement on Monday saying that Chicago Sports Network will carry Bulls and Blackhawks games beginning in October. White Sox coverage will begin with the 2025 season, after NBC Sports Chicago goes dark. The teams will provide coverage from studios at the United Center and Guaranteed Rate Field.\n\nThe details of the deal, including where and how fans can gain access to the new network, remain unclear. The Cubs initially had difficulty finding carriers for the Marquee Network, holding protracted negotiations with Comcast, and the new network faces the same challenge in an evolving marketplace for regional sports networks.\n\nIn the statement, the network said it \"will have agreements with traditional cable providers, streaming services and be available via free, over-the-air broadcast.\"\n\n\"As we set out to design the network, we began and ended every discussion with the simple question: What is best for our fans?\" Coyle said in a statement. \"What is the best approach to distribution? How can we push the limits of both in-game and studio production? We plan to serve our fans on as many platforms and in as many markets as our rights allow.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Reinsdorf", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Reinsdorf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESN", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NESN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Wirtz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Wirtz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_S._Ricketts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas S.

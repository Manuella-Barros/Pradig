Flapping in the wind on her veranda deep in rural Sweden, she discovered the weirdest thing \u2013 a tiny three-piece navy corduroy suit. It was so small it would only fit a 10-year-old \u2013 but with her son all grown up, Kristina had no clue who had placed it there. Living on her own by a lake and 30 minutes from the nearest town, she felt sure that whoever was behind this mystery was known to her. So, Kristina \u2013 who was in her fifties at the time \u2013 tucked the evidence away in her wardrobe for safekeeping and asked everyone she knew if they had any idea who could be behind this strange incident. But nobody seemed to know a thing. Then, 18 months later, the mystery intensified. Returning home on an April evening, Kristina discovered another strange present waiting for her on the veranda. This time, a small, classic suitcase containing a tiny pillow, a toiletries bag, a toothbrush, a Hawaiian shirt, a comic book, used but clean underpants, skin-coloured tights and a pair of vintage swimming goggles. The evidence (Picture: Alexander Tengner) The beautiful scene of the crime (Picture: Alexander Tengner) Kristina was now scared that these two incidents were a sign of something more sinister. Given the remoteness of her location, she felt the culprit had to be watching her and waiting for her to leave. So did she have a stalker? Or was this just a friend\u2019s attempt as a silly prank? Once again, Kristina quizzed everyone she knew in a desperate attempt to seek answers but no one seemed to know anything. She even threatened to go to the police in the hope it would scare the culprit into confessing. However, after a year or so of interrogating her inner circle, she was still no closer to the truth. She felt sure the police wouldn\u2019t take this case seriously either so decided to admit defeat and let things lie. 15 years on, Kristina might finally be close to finding out who left the strange collection of items on her veranda, as the case has been picked up by a true crime podcast team. Well, sort of. The team are back on another case (Picture: Alexander Tengner) Four years on from the \u2018poodunit\u2019 hit comedy podcast, Who Shat On The Floor At My Wedding, advertising exec turned amateur detective Lauren Kilby is back to solve the mystery of the tiny suit. Working with her are friends \u2013 and fellow stars of the 2020 podcast \u2013 Karen Whitehouse and Helen MacLaughlin. The trio\u2019s first case \u2013 which has since been downloaded 6 million times \u2013 was all about trying to find out which of their guests had left a very public poo behind at Karen and Helen\u2019s wedding reception, and saw Lauren adopting some slightly unique investigative techniques. With their second series, called The Case of The Tiny Suit/Case, centering around a brand new mystery, the gang insist the new investigation has left them feeling more cynical than ever. Who Shat On The Floor At My Wedding tried to crack a messy crime (Picture: Supplied) \u2018This whole experience has made us realise that even your closest friends and family can have some seriously weird stuff going on behind closed doors,\u2019 Karen explains to Metro. \u2018This second season has proven no different. It\u2019s been a real eye opener.\u2019 And again, it\u2019s a mystery close to home, as Kristina is Lauren\u2019s mother in law. \u2018The three of us were spending some time at my in-laws house to discuss the potential new mystery for season two when my mother in law started mentioning this case,\u2019 Lauren explains. \u2018The great thing is that she is so eager to solve it and wants to know who the culprit is before she dies. She kept the evidence too and that gave us a big incentive to start investigating.\u2019 This season will see the sleuths employ their fan favourite techniques of hooking suspects up to lie-detector tests and asking forensic experts for their thoughts and theories. Forensic extraction (Picture: Alexander Tengner) Lauren says during one task, she even takes the coat hanger the suit was hanging on and attempts to raid people\u2019s wardrobes to see if she can discover a match. Forensic Psychologist Professor Mike Berry also goes undercover at a party full of suspects as Karen\u2019s \u2018mad uncle\u2019. \u2018This time round, we got some real experts on the case,\u2019 Karen explains. \u2018Although we still embrace our inexperience and complete lack of ability.\u2019 \u2018We\u2019re very proud of our amateur sleuthing,\u2019 Lauren adds. \u2018But we have real evidence too this time. No one held on to the poo from Karen and Helen\u2019s wedding. Clearly they weren\u2019t thinking like detectives.\u2019 Lauren and Karen admit they all felt under intense pressure to get answers after failing to solve the poo mystery from season one. But they assure fans that this season won\u2019t disappoint. The detectives (L-R): Helen, Lauren and Karen (Picture: Alexander Tengner) \u2018We uncover something we weren\u2019t expecting and there\u2019s a twist at the end that\u2019s really shocking,\u2019 Karen says. And the trio may already have their plot for season three, as Lauren admits she has recently fallen victim to a similar crime to her mother in law. \u2018Someone has been sending me loads of mayonnaise,\u2019 she says. \u2018A mystery person. 15 litres of the stuff and I hate mayonnaise. These podcasts have taught me you can\u2019t trust anyone. I\u2019ve suspected my boyfriend. Who knows? Someone was capable of s***ting at Karen and Helen\u2019s wedding so people are plain weird.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ve even accused me of sending you the mayonnaise!\u2019 Karen laughs. \u2018It\u2019s caused tension,\u201dLauren agrees, nodding. \u2018You don\u2019t know who to trust.\u2019 Detective Lauren Kilby inspecting the scene of the crime (Picture: Supplied) \u2018I trust no one now,\u2019 she adds. As for the original \u2018poodunnit\u2019 mystery, Karen and Lauren say that while the culprit remains at large, they do have new evidence that could lead to a bonus episode. \u2018There have been updates,\u2019 Karen teases. \u2018There\u2019s more interrogations to carry out. I think our friends and family worry they could be pulled into an episode at any moment.\u201d \u2018They\u2019re all terrified of us now,\u2019 Lauren adds. \u2018Don\u2019t put a foot wrong or we\u2019ll launch a podcast on you.\u2019", "summary": "Kristina didn't know if it was a stalker or a silly prank.", "url": "https://metro.co.uk/2024/06/09/someone-leave-a-childs-suit-outside-a-rural-swedish-house-20990315/", "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SEC_207716678-ba75.jpg?quality=90&strip=all", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:00:00", "author": "Kat Romero", "authors": ["Kat Romero"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.272}

It comes as mystery surrounds the make-up of Sam Mitchell\u2019s side, with tagger Finn Maginness not included in the team but travelling as the emergency after not being named for Box Hill in the VFL. The Eagles named Yeo in the side for the clash at Optus Stadium on Sunday but were giving him plenty of time to decide if he was up for taking to the field after the passing of his father Craig on Monday night. While a decision could still be made on the morning of the game, the Eagles have named all three of their emergencies in Andrew Gaff, Harry Edwards and Jack Hutchinson in the WAFL among 16 AFL-listed players to take on Swan Districts earlier in the day. TheNightly Get in front of tomorrow's news for FREE Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.READ NOW Gaff was picked as the back up for Yeo, having been dropped for second time this season after their shock nine-point loss to the previously winless North Melbourne before the bye. Bringing in the veteran wingman wouldn\u2019t upset the balance of the Eagles\u2019 side too much though given the return of No.1 draftee Harley Reid and Tim Kelly from suspension and injury respectively. The Eagles also ran premiership forward Liam Ryan through the midfield, with the All-Australian collecting a career-high 19 touches and six clearances and showcasing pace out the front of the stoppage. West Coast coach Adam Simpson said Yeo had the flexibility to decide if he was up to playing. \u201cWe\u2019ve really trying to respect the decision he\u2019s going through which is tragic,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cHe popped in the club yesterday for the morning, he\u2019s here today (Friday), we\u2019ll see how he goes through the Captain\u2019s Run, and we\u2019ll give him up to the last minute before the game before preparing to play. \u201cIf he feels like he\u2019s not up for it then he won\u2019t. It\u2019s totally up to Elliot, how he\u2019s feeling and what he has to deal with, with his family.\u201d Eagles fans are excited by the return of Reid after a two-game suspension either side of the bye, but could be set for some extra attention once again if Maginness is a late inclusion. Simpson indicated a way for Reid to beat the tag was for him to play forward more. \u201cThey\u2019re a pretty dangerous midfield themselves. They\u2019re like No.1 in a lot of stats around the stoppages so I think they\u2019ll back in their system,\u201d he said.Camera IconNick Daicos of the Magpies and Finn Maginness of the Hawks.

With his flexibility about going forward as well we can explore that. \u201cIt (being tagged) will happen again, no doubt especially if he catches fire like he does sometimes.\u201d Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Email Us Copy the Link Register and have your say.

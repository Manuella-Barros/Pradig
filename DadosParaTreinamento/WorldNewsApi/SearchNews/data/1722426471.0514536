England travelled to Germany as favourites to win the Euros and bring home the nation\u2019s first major trophy in men\u2019s football since 1966. But confidence began to fade during an uninspiring group stage in which England laboured to a 1-0 victory over Serbia and failed to beat Denmark and Slovenia. Much criticism has been aimed at Southgate for his tactics and Three Lions legend Rooney believes he \u2018killed\u2019 Trent Alexander-Arnold and Conor Gallagher by throwing them both into midfield before quickly \u2018discarding\u2019 them. Alexander-Arnold, who has spent most of his career at right-back for Liverpool, started alongside Declan Rice against Serbia and Denmark to mixed success, before Chelsea\u2019s Gallagher came in for the Slovenia game only to be hauled off at half-time. Kobbie Mainoo was Southgate\u2019s third option in midfield and Rooney reckons the England boss has now stumbled upon his best set-up in the centre of the pitch, while he also wants Anthony Gordon and Cole Palmer more involved in the last-16 clash against Slovakia. \u2018Against Slovenia, Kobbie Mainoo staked a big claim for a starting place, Cole Palmer was very good and Anthony Gordon, though he played only a few minutes, had a couple of excellent touches,\u2019 Rooney told The Times. England manager Gareth Southgate in Euro 2024 training (Picture: Getty) \u2018At just the right time in the tournament, Gareth may have stumbled upon the right team. I would play at least two of those three youngsters against Slovakia \u2013 and, in fact, I said before the tournament that my starting XI for the knockout stage would have Mainoo and Gordon in it. \u2018None of what happened in the group stage surprised me. I would never have played Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield and expected that, when the experiment didn\u2019t work, Gareth would try Conor Gallagher. \u2018Gareth killed both a bit by discarding them, but in each case it was the right call and when Mainoo came in you saw him making forward runs and showing composure on the ball. \u2018Palmer? He is just suited to international football. He can take the ball, he\u2019s calm on it and has the personality you need on that stage. Gordon is more direct than the other two and ensures there is a good blend. \u2018With those three on the pitch you saw runners going beyond Harry which, good as Bellingham, Bukayo Saka and Foden are, we had not seen from them.\u2019 If England overcome Slovakia, who finished third in Group E, they will face Euros holders Italy or Switzerland in the quarter-finals. Rating England\u2019s chances of becoming European champions, Rooney added: \u2018I think they have a great chance of winning these Euros, I really do. \u2018They won their group, are into a half of the draw where they avoid the biggest teams and we know \u2013 and they know \u2013 they can play a lot better.\u2019 For more stories like this, check our sport page.

That's my 10-year plan,\" she said, later telling her friends, \"I feel like you need less Botox for more emotion and I don't have it. I'm not gonna be gaining 500 lbs. for a role... that's not where I need to be. How am I gonna cry? How am I gonna be scared out of my mind?\"\n\nDespite her concerns, Kim said she was still determined to make her mark acting in movies.\n\n\"I wasn't planning on this career and was like, I'm not gonna get ahead of myself here,\" she explained. \"I'm really nervous about it 'cause I have to f---ing deliver. It's such a challenge for me and I want to welcome a challenge, and I'm like, every year I want to do something that makes me so uncomfortable that I really have to challenge myself.\"\n\nKim made a splash in 2023 when she took on a recurring role in American Horror Story: Delicate, playing an entertainment publicist named Siobhan, who works for actress Anna Victoria Alcott (Emma Roberts). The horror series' 12th season followed Roberts' character as she struggled to start a family while promoting a successful movie during awards season.\n\nThe series marked Kim's first foray into acting for the screen in more than a decade, aside from occasional cameo roles as herself in movies like Ocean's Eight (2018). She also voiced Delores, a standard poodle, in two Paw Patrol movies.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kardashians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Kardashians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janine_Brito", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Janine Brito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Pell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paula Pell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Wives_Club_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Wives Club (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hangover_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hangover (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridesmaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bridesmaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Horror_Story:_Delicate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Horror Story: Delicate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAW_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PAW Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poodle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poodle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emma Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queen Victoria"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/sx8hVPsTt9biXKZOPHRcQmxiI4M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(741x257:743x259)/Kim-Kardashian-skiing-013124-tout-ed4ae4f5417248b6bcf96674223773e3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667019", "eventUri": "eng-9667019", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 446, "textEnd": 453}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

That way she doesn't get let down if they fall through.\n\nLater, The Kardashians checked in on Kim as she was driving away from her first meeting of the day.\n\nShe told her agent that the executives she met with all seemed interested, but she hoped to get a bigger offer.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, she said she had so much going on that 'unless we're going to be the biggest commercial movie and have the best cast and break the internet,' she wouldn't be able to give it her all.\n\nIn a confessional, she admitted she would have to give something up, and the reality show producer asked her what it would be.\n\n'My sleep,' she responded without a pause.\n\nThe movie was titled The Fifth Wheel, and it was to be written by the married team of Paula Pell -- who wrote for SNL and 30 Rock -- and Janine Brito (pictured)\n\nKim got a pep talk from her agent between pitches, but she said she didn't want to get excited unless it was confirmed that the film would be made\n\nAfter her final pitch, she went out to dinner with her 'lifers,' a group of her female friends she had know since they were teens, which included her pals Allison Statter, Zoe Winkler, Simone Harouche and Sarah Meyer Michaelson.\n\nKim mentioned how they were all aging, as she found the menu blurry and could no longer see her phone close up, which just suddenly happened one day.\n\nShe was at first coy about her 'project,' but then she admitted she had sold a romantic comedy to Netflix after her friends begged her for details.\n\nKim explained that until recently she didn't have an agent, but after she appeared on American Horror Story she began meeting with interested agents, one of whom mentioned Paula Pell.\n\nKim recounts explaining the plot of The Fifth Wheel, which would feature four women going on a trip, and she compared it to The Hangover films, Bridesmaids and The First Wives Club.\n\nShe said the studio executive had all loved the idea, and each studio gave her agent a call 20 minutes later with offers, though she elected to go with Netflix, which tends to offer more money up front, as there won't be a chance to make any performance-based bonuses since the film will only be available on the streaming service.\n\nAfter her good news, Zoe jokingly wondered why Kim didn't mention that she was going to pitch a movie in the girls' group chat.\n\nBut Kim explained that she didn't want to get ahead of herself with a new career.\n\nKim shared her good news about selling her rom-com to Netflix with her old friends at a dinner meet-up\n\nThe women had all been friends since they were teens\n\nKim's friends were overjoyed to learn that she had sold her film, which she said her friend Amy Schumer was interested in starring in\n\nShe told the ladies that she would be one of the stars of the film, while also producing the movie, and now she could relax because it had been sold to a distributor.\n\nThen, in a self deprecating moment, Kim joked that she could do about one movie per year going forward, and she said she would have about 10 years left in which she would look good.\n\nAfter those 10 busy years she could finally take some time off.\n\nThen Kim continued to gush about how her friend Amy Schumer -- who has previously appeared on The Kardashians -- had written her to say she wanted to be in the film.\n\nKim admitted she was 'proud' that Amy and others wanted to join her project.\n\n'You think I can do that?' she recalled thinking about the offers for the film started pouring in.\n\n'I'm tripping the f*** out, low-key,' Kim said, but she cautioned that she still had to 'deliver.'\n\nHer friend Allison then suggested that Kim could be the first 'female 007.'\n\nHer friend Allison suggested that Kim could be the 'female 007,' which Kim approved of\n\nBut she wasn't willing to give up her Botox in order to act better or cry on demand\n\n'Instead of a Bond girl, it should be Bond boys,' said an approving Kim as she nodded her head. 'That would be epic.'\n\nShe added that she really 'loved the idea' of being a female Bond.\n\nBut then Kim starting worrying about the logistics of being a movie star.\n\n'I also feel like you need less botox for more emotion, and I don't have it,' she joked to her friends.\n\nShe also ruled out any Raging Bull-style body transformations.\n\n'I'm not gonna be gaining 500 pounds for a role and losing,' she continued as her friends chuckled. 'That's just not where I'm going to be.'\n\nThe episode opened on Beverly Hills as Kim prepared for an all-star Balenciaga fashion show happening out in the open.\n\nFittingly, her model sister Kendall Jenner joined her, and the two walked along a closed-down street while navigating through crowds of models and crew preparing the show.\n\n'Every Balenciaga show is such a moment, so it's really fun to see it all come to life,' Kim gushed later in her confessional interview.\n\nThe episode opened on Beverly Hills as Kim prepared for an all-star Balenciaga fashion show happening out in the open\n\nKim was joined by her model sister Kendall, and she groused the Khlo\u00e9 skipped the show despite being invited, which she blamed on her belief that she has agoraphobia\n\nKim was now a Balenciaga Ambassador, so her presence was essential\n\nShe noted that her sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian didn't join them despite being invited, and she added with some venom in her voice that her younger sister didn't come because the fashion show was 'outdoors' and in the 'daylight.'\n\nKim then explained that she thinks Khlo\u00e9 may be suffering from agoraphobia, though it's not clear if she thought it might be a clinical case, or just that her sister is turning into a homebody.\n\n'I get it, but it's time to break out of it,' she added with audible annoyance.\n\nKim noted that she is officially a brand ambassador for Balenciaga, even though people had assumed she was long before that after she began wearing numerous outfits from the Spanish fashion house.\n\nKim's ex-husband Kanye West had previously collaborated with Balenciaga, but the luxury fashion line severed their ties in 2022 in the wake of antisemitic comments the rapper made.\n\nKim also noted that she was getting ready to pitch a new comedy film, which she will presumably star in, so she was branching out and even busier than usual.\n\nWhile she was at the fashion show, it cuts away to reveal other stars walking with the models, including Brigitte Nielsen and Cardi B.\n\nAfter her time at the Balenciaga show, Kendall was seen driving over to her younger sister Kylie Jenner's house.\n\nCelebrities including Cardi B and Brigitte Nielsen walked the runway\n\nKendall had cut out from the Balenciaga show to visit Kylie's house with an adorably fluffy puppy\n\nThey wanted to introduce to their mother Kris' dog Bridgette, which was also a Poodle mix\n\nKendall brought along an adorably fluffy puppy, which they wanted to introduce to their mother Kris Jenner's dog Bridgette.\n\nBridgette, like the puppy, appeared to be a poodle mix, and Kylie and Kendall admitted they had always wanted to style Bridgette like a traditional poodle with most of her hair trimmed short and accented with longer poofs.\n\n'Hair grows, why not at least try,' Kendall said.\n\nKylie worried that their mother might be furious if she suddenly discovered her dog had gotten a drastic haircut, though Kendall thought their reality show might help them out of a jam.\n\n'Because the cameras are on, I don't think she'll get that mad,' Kendall added.\n\n'I think I'm good at pranks...' Kylie later said in a confessional, though she sounded unsure of herself and trailed off.\n\nThe two made their way over to Kris' home and snuck in before calling out for Bridgette.\n\nThe dog cautiously turned a corner and started to walk toward them, but Kendall and Kylie were disappointed to see that she had recently had a haircut, so her hair was too short for their intended cut.\n\nKylie and Kendall admitted they had always wanted to style Bridgette like a traditional Poodle, so they decided to prank their mom by giving her dog a surprise haircut\n\nBut Bridgette had already had her fur cut too short, and they ran into another obstacle when Kris' boyfriend Corey Gamble appeared and looked confused about why they were in the house unannounced\n\nThen they met in the kitchen to fess up.

It's so easy!' Kris added in confessional. 'What the f*** is wrong with you guys?'\n\nBut Kylie vowed that they would think of a more substantial prank later.\n\nAs they were leaving with the puppy, Kylie let out a high-pitched squeak that confused Kris, and she head to explain that it was a hiccup.\n\n'That's your hiccup?!' Kris responded, as she had apparently never heard the unusual mouse-like squeal, and Kendall admitted that she sounded the same when she hiccuped.\n\nThe sisters left their mom's house and headed back to Kylie's abode to unwind, but the conversation took a darker, more emotional turn as the cosmetics mogul made a major confession.\n\nKylie, who was wearing a chic dark blue denim jacket and matching jeans, noted that it's hard to spend time with her sisters because they're so busy.\n\n'How can you not prank me? It's so easy!' Kris added in confessional. 'What the f*** is wrong with you guys?'\n\nBack at her house, Kylie confessed that it was a 'miracle' that she still had any 'confidence' left and that she could look in a mirror and 'think that I'm pretty' after being mocked online for a recent outing\n\n'Well that was a failure,' she said as Kendall agreed that they were the 'worst prankers.'\n\n'But, I love hanging out with you!' Kylie said.\n\nBut then she confessed that it was a 'miracle' that she still had any 'confidence' left and that she could look in a mirror and 'think that I'm pretty.'\n\nKylie complained to her sister about how people had been making fun of her online after she stepped out in the City of Lights for Paris Fashion Week.\n\nShe said a photo had gone around of herself after she decided not to wear a lot of makeup.\n\nKylie said that if she wore a lot of makeup, people would she she was wearing 'too much makeup,' but if she went in the opposite direction, people would also criticize her on social media.\n\nIn particular, she was hurt that fans -- as well as cosmetic dermatologists and professionals experienced with injecting fillers and botox -- had pointed out diagonal lines running through her plump cheeks\n\nSome fans and professionals had speculated that she had used too much filler below her eyes and over her cheek bones, creating the prominent crease.\n\nShe appeared to refer to her appearance at Paris Fashion Week, when trolls claimed she looked 'old' and bashed her for alleged using too much filler. Even dermatologists and filler specialists shared their opinion on her filler use; pictured January 24 in Paris\n\nShe was hurt that fans pointed out diagonal lines running through her plump cheeks, which they said could indicate too much filler use. But they can be visible on anyone, even children, and Kylie claimed she had the lines going back to when she was a child\n\nKendall was a sympathetic ear. Kylie wondered why it was acceptable to say mean things about her online and began to cry\n\nHowever, the lines can be visible on anyone, even in children, and Kylie claimed that the feature had always been prominent on her going back to when she was a child.\n\n'I just hear nasty things about myself all the time,' Kylie admitted in the confessional interview.\n\nThe billionaire reality star and cosmetics mogul wondered aloud to her sister why people didn't more prominently defend her online.\n\n'I'm kind of like, so numb to people talking about my looks at this point, and I just want to know why on the internet no one says anything or thinks that it's OK,' she said.\n\nKendall said it was an issue for the whole family, and they were 'dehumanized' in the public eye.\n\n'They don't think that there are any rules with us,' sh said, adding that people don't think they have 'any feelings.'\n\n'If you talked the same way you talk about us about any other woman, people would come to their defense all day long,' Kendall added.\n\nKylie was particularly upset because she was trying to find a new, more natural looking, and she confessed to being on a 'journey' over the past year in which she dissolved 'half' of her lip filler.\n\n'I think with me it's never going to change,' Kylie said, before pausing as tears started to well up in her eyes.\n\nKylie said she hadn't cried about the comments before, but she was set off by people who said it was fine to criticize her looks because 'she did it to herself.' '\"She f***ed up her face. She has so much surgery,\"' she recalled reading.\n\nKendall wrapped her arms around Kylie to comfort her as she sobbed\n\nKendall said it was an issue for the whole family, and they were 'dehumanized' in the public eye. 'They don't think that there are any rules with us,' sh said, adding that people don't think they have 'any feelings'\n\nAs she brushed them away, Kendall took a seat next to hear and wrapped her in a hug.\n\n'Why do people think it's OK to talk about me?' Kylie asked through her tears.\n\nShe said she hadn't cried about the mean comments before, and as the tears slowed she shared how she occasionally sees defensive comments, but others claim online that it's fine to criticize her looks because 'she did it to herself.'\n\n'\"She f***ed up her face. She has so much surgery,\"' she recalls reading.\n\nKylie said people had complained about her looks even before she got fillers, and she seemed distressed that people say she looks 'old,' though Kendall claimed she looked younger than ever.\n\nThe model said they would never get past the comments, as people would always assume they had both gotten 'full facial reconstructions.'\n\n'I can't let the comments get me down,' Kylie said. 'I can't let the comments get me down. I have s*** to do. Rise above.'\n\nThen the action cut to Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian ahead of a brief exit from her mansion.\n\n'Breaking news, guys! I am leaving Hidden Hills!' she gushed, but she wasn't going far from home, and her excuse was that Kourtney might go into labor at any moment.\n\nThen the action cut to Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian ahead of a brief exit from her mansion.

Khlo\u00e9 said, as she emphasized that she wanted to be single for a while.\n\nBut she was happy for her friend and approved of her trying to find a real partner before resulting to an anonymous sperm donor.\n\nWhile they talked about a date that didn't end well with an insistent suitor who wouldn't stop texting Malika, Khloe admitted that she had been turned on when her ex-husband Lamar Odom found out they had the same business manager and sought out her contact info after she wouldn't give him her number. She found his persistence sexy.\n\nWhile driving, Khlo\u00e9 also complained that they couldn't have as much fun in public anymore because there are phones everywhere now.\n\nIn a confessional, Khloe admitted she didn't want to start dating again because it might 'f*** up' her kids, and she had been disappointed by her recent romantic interests.\n\nBack at the goat farm, Khlo\u00e9 gushed over how 'cute' the little animals were.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 thought the baby goats were adorable, but she didn't think they would make good pets since they weren't housetrained and they wanted to eat her jacket and bite Malika\n\nShe FaceTimes her daughter true to see the goats, and she was delighted\n\nA group of young kids recognized Khlo\u00e9 and were over the moon to see her, so she stopped to chat with them for a few minutes and gave the girls a group hug\n\nA group of young kids recognized Khlo\u00e9 and were over the moon to see her, so she stopped to chat with them for a few minutes and gave the girls a group hug\n\n'True would die,' Khlo\u00e9 said, before FaceTiming her daughter, who clearly loved the animals, even as they tried to eat Khlo\u00e9's jacket and bite Malika.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 admitted she 'definitely didn't think everything through,' such as how the goats 'poop little pellets' and 'pee everywhere' and have a tendency to hump each other.\n\n'Classic Carl,' an employee said of one particularly sexed-up goat.\n\n'Pets and men are two different things,' Khlo\u00e9 said, because pets only require food and petting.\n\nWhile at the farm, a group of visiting school children saw Khlo\u00e9 and shouted her name.\n\nShe said 'hi' back to them and gave a group of young girls a big hug.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 had a 'hard time' believing eight- or nine-year-old girls would know who she was, but she still spent a few minutes with them and gave them high fives.\n\nBack in the confessional, she told her producer that she '100 percent' expects to be married again in the future.\n\nThe final -- and longest -- section of the episode was devoted to her sister Kourtney Kardashian, her husband Travis Barker and the birth of their first child together, whom they had named Rocky.\n\nThe final -- and longest -- section of the episode was devoted to her sister Kourtney Kardashian, her husband Travis Barker and the birth of their first child together, whom they had named Rocky. She felt a contraction while they looked at old photos in bed\n\nKourtney recalled traumatic surgery to clear fluid in Rocky's lungs while he was in the womb, but he made a miraculous recovery\n\n'It's time to go,' she whispered to Travis after her contractions began, so they left for the hospital on the night of October 29\n\nOn October 29, 2023, Kourtney and Travis were sitting in bed looking at old photos of themselves on his phone when she announced that she had had a contraction.\n\n'My baby's about to pop,' Travis said gleefully.\n\nHe said it would be the first 'natural birth' he had experienced, and he said he would be filming Rocky as he was born.\n\nBut Kourtney objected, saying she didn't want him to be 'down there.'\n\nShe said she didn't want Travis to be 'traumatized by your favorite thing in the world.'\n\nLater that night the lovebirds drove to the hospital, and Kourtney joked that Rocky was waiting for a Halloween birthday.\n\nBoth parents guessed that Rocky would weigh exactly eight pounds.\n\nThen Kourtney looked back to a traumatic event months earlier when doctors had discovered fluid in Rocky's lungs, which was 'super rare,' but they were 'lucky' to have caught it.\n\nKourtney filmed herself on her phone from her hospital bed and admitted she was 'filled with fear' after the surgery.\n\nThings seemed to take a downturn when the fluid returned to Rocky's lungs.\n\nBut then Kourtney saw a video on the power of positive thinking, and after she tried to focus on optimistic thoughts, she claimed that the fluid had completely disappeared.\n\nBut she still wasn't dilated enough by the morning of October 30, so she had to bounce on a ball to stimulate labor\n\nThey left for lunch at Crossroads and then went home to have sex. 'That helps sometimes,' Kourtney said with a sly smile\n\n'It's time to go,' she whispered then as she prepared to birth Rocky.\n\nA nurse attending to her said she was one to two centimeters dilated and had some bleeding, which didn't concern her.\n\nBut then it was 10 in the morning on October 30, and Kourtney revealed that she had gotten up to three centimeters dilated by 4 a.m., but there was no progress after that.\n\nShe was seen bouncing on a big rubber ball in her hospital gown and moving in circles to stimulate the labor while talking on the phone with her family.\n\nKourtney even wondered if she should cool it with the ball exercises, as she really wanted Rocky to wait until Halloween.\n\n'You better squeeze him out, baby's gonna be 10 pounds,' Travis joked as the morning progressed.\n\nThey decided to leave the hospital while things were stalled, but first they left to eat at Crossroads.\n\nOnce they were home, Kourtney revealed that they showered and then had sex.\n\n'That helps sometimes,' she said with a sly smile.\n\nFinally, it was October 31, and Travis told Kourtney that Rocky 'thinks today is the day.'\n\nTravis drummed to the baby's heartbeat, which Kourtney found relaxing, rather than intensely annoying. But by 11:45 p.m.her doctor decided it was time to induce labor\n\nShe got a surprise guest when her mom Kris Jenner arrived uninvited because she was 'in the area,' so she sat masked up by the wall\n\nFinally, it was October 31, and Travis told Kourtney that Rocky 'thinks today is the day.'\n\nBut he had second thoughts on the way back to the hospital.\n\n'We said it too much that his birthday was gonna be on Halloween,' Travis mused on the ride over.\n\nThe Blink-182 member had an odd way of calming his nerves while he waited for Kourtney to go into labor.\n\nHe had brought along his drum practice pad and began banging out rudiments at the the same tempo as Rocky's heartbeat.\n\nMany women in labor might have found the din unbearably annoying, but Kourtney was on the same page as her husband.\n\nShe said she found the drumming soothing, and she said Travis' practice had helped her fall asleep in the past.\n\nBefore Rocky arrived, she reflected that they were 'too afraid to feel it' after she got pregnant because they worried it was 'too good to be true,' especially after they had given up on IVF treatments.\n\nWhile she was on her side in her hospital bed and being attended to by a nurse, a faint splashing sound was heard on the soundtrack, and Kourtney said she finally broke her water, indicating that Rocky was arriving soon.\n\nKourtney had planned for Travis to be the only family member with her in the delivery room, but her plans had a major shake up after a surprise guest arrived -- her mother Kris.\n\nDespite gatecrashing the birth, Kris tried to be innocuous by sitting on the other side of the room while masked up and looking at her phone.\n\nKourtney confessed to Travis that she had been craving Ritz Bits crackers for a day\n\nDespite her best efforts, Kourtney gave birth just one minute too late for the baby to be the Halloween King, and Rocky Thirteen Barker entered the world at 12:00 a.m. on November 1\n\nIn her confessional interview, Kourtney revealed that she got a surprise call from her security that her mother had arrived at the hospital and wanted to join her.\n\nKris told the guard she was 'just in the area,' so she decided to drop in on the birth.\n\n'She was not in the area,' Kourtney grumbled, although she didn't have the heart to ban her mother from getting to see her grandson be born.\n\nAs she waited for the big moment after reaching four centimeters dilation, Kourtney confessed to Travis that she had been craving some Ritz Bits crackers since the day before.\n\nAs it got closer and closer to midnight, Kourtney admitted: 'I think Rocky wants to be November first.'\n\nTravis agreed: 'Yeah, he doesn't want to be the King of Halloween.'\n\nBut there was still a slim chance after her doctor decided to induce her at 11:45 p.m.\n\nKourtney was surprised when Travis, who had been playing music in the hospital room all night, switched to exclusively Frank Sinatra as Rocky's arrival was imminent.\n\nDespite her best efforts, Kourtney gave birth just one minute too late for the baby to be the Halloween King, and Rocky Thirteen Barker entered the world at 12:00 a.m. on November 1.\n\nAfter the lengthy birthing process and the joyous moment of meeting Rocky, Kris comforted her daughter in her inimitable way. 'Do you want a Cheez-It or whatever you call them?' she asked her daughter\n\nTravis played Frank Sinatra leading up to the birth, and they later determined that it was his 1966 classic That's Life that was playing when Rocky was born\n\nAfter the lengthy birthing process and the joyous moment of meeting Rocky, Kris comforted her daughter in her inimitable way.\n\n'Do you want a Cheez-It or whatever you call them?' she asked her daughter\n\nBut Kourtney admitted later that she was glad her mother was there, as Kris had a calming effect over the proceedings.\n\nLater, during her confessional interview, Kourtney paused to FaceTime Travis, and he gushed that Rocky's birth was 'one of the best days' of his life.\n\nHe added that he wanted to watch the show's footage of the birth.\n\n'I want to know what song he popped out to,' Travis explained.\n\nThey determined the song was Sinatra's performance of That's Life, the title track of his classic 1966 LP\n\n'The song just came up in the playlist and we were like, \"What a perfect song,\"' Kourtney recalled.\n\nAs Travis sat in the hospital bed and cuddled little Rocky, Kourtney beamed with love for him after the fact during her interview.\n\n'I have the most amazing and supportive husband I could ever dream of,' she said sweetly.\n\nShe gave thanks, adding that 'the way that it all happened is just such a reminder that God's timing is everything.'\n\nIn the preview for next week's episode, Kim plans the family's popular Christmas Eve Party with imported snow for a full white Christmas, but thunder on the horizon threatens to ruin the outdoor bash.\n\nMeanwhile, Khlo\u00e9 was once again at home with her kids and her brother Rob Kardashian's daughter Dream.\n\nWhile visiting her, Kim claimed Khlo\u00e9's kids rule her life.\n\n'Live your f***ing life! Get out!' she shouted at her younger sister.\n\nTravis gushed that Rocky's birth was 'one of the best days' of his life\n\n'I have the most amazing and supportive husband I could ever dream of,' Kourtney said sweetly. She gave thanks, adding that 'the way that it all happened is just such a reminder that God's timing is everything'\n\nThen all the women were about to take a family vacation, but something went awry as Kylie joined them on the private jet.\n\n'I just have a really bad feeling,' Kylie confessed, before getting off the plane with no explanation.\n\nThe very last moment of the episode was a humorous tag in which one of Khlo\u00e9's confessional interviews was interrupted by a spider descending in front of her.\n\nLuckily, a crew member apprehended it and saved her, but not before they poked fun at her frightened expression with a freeze frame.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

That way she doesn't get let down if they fall through.\n\nLater, The Kardashians checked in on Kim as she was driving away from her first meeting of the day.\n\nShe told her agent that the executives she met with all seemed interested, but she hoped to get a bigger offer.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, she said she had so much going on that 'unless we're going to be the biggest commercial movie and have the best cast and break the internet,' she wouldn't be able to give it her all.\n\nIn a confessional, she admitted she would have to give something up, and the reality show producer asked her what it would be.\n\n'My sleep,' she responded without a pause.\n\nShe met up with her longtime friends for dinner after Netflix bought the rom-com, but she worried about playing more dramatic roles like a female Bond, as she wasn't willing to give up her Botox in order to cry on command\n\nAfter her final pitch, she went out to dinner with her 'lifers,' a group of her female friends she had know since they were teens, which included her pals Allison Statter, Zoe Winkler, Simone Harouche and Sarah Meyer Michaelson.\n\nKim mentioned how they were all aging, as she found the menu blurry and could no longer see her phone close up, which just suddenly happened one day.\n\nShe was at first coy about her 'project,' but then she admitted she had sold a romantic comedy to Netflix after her friends begged her for details.\n\nKim explained that until recently she didn't have an agent, but after she appeared on American Horror Story she began meeting with interested agents, one of whom mentioned Paula Pell.\n\nKim recounts explaining the plot of The Fifth Wheel, which would feature four women going on a trip, and she compared it to The Hangover films, Bridesmaids and The First Wives Club.\n\nShe said the studio executive had all loved the idea, and each studio gave her agent a call 20 minutes later with offers, though she elected to go with Netflix, which tends to offer more money up front, as there won't be a chance to make any performance-based bonuses since the film will only be available on the streaming service.\n\nAfter her good news, Zoe jokingly wondered why Kim didn't mention that she was going to pitch a movie in the girls' group chat.\n\nBut Kim explained that she didn't want to get ahead of herself with a new career.\n\nShe told the ladies that she would be one of the stars of the film, while also producing the movie, and now she could relax because it had been sold to a distributor.\n\nThen, in a self deprecating moment, Kim joked that she could do about one movie per year going forward, and she said she would have about 10 years left in which she would look good.\n\nAfter those 10 busy years she could finally take some time off.\n\nThen Kim continued to gush about how her friend Amy Schumer -- who has previously appeared on The Kardashians -- had written her to say she wanted to be in the film.\n\nKim admitted she was 'proud' that Amy and others wanted to join her project.\n\n'You think I can do that?' she recalled thinking about the offers for the film started pouring in.\n\n'I'm tripping the f*** out, low-key,' Kim said, but she cautioned that she still had to 'deliver.'\n\nHer friend Allison then suggested that Kim could be the first 'female 007.'\n\n'Instead of a Bond girl, it should be Bond boys,' said an approving Kim as she nodded her head. 'That would be epic.'\n\nShe added that she really 'loved the idea' of being a female Bond.\n\nBut then Kim starting worrying about the logistics of being a movie star.\n\n'I also feel like you need less botox for more emotion, and I don't have it,' she joked to her friends.\n\nShe also ruled out any Raging Bull-style body transformations.\n\n'I'm not gonna be gaining 500 pounds for a role and losing,' she continued as her friends chuckled. 'That's just not where I'm going to be.'\n\nThe episode opened on Beverly Hills as Kim prepared for an all-star Balenciaga fashion show happening out in the open.\n\nFittingly, her model sister Kendall Jenner joined her, and the two walked along a closed-down street while navigating through crowds of models and crew preparing the show.\n\n'Every Balenciaga show is such a moment, so it's really fun to see it all come to life,' Kim gushed later in her confessional interview.\n\nShe noted that her sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian didn't join them despite being invited, and she added with some venom in her voice that her younger sister didn't come because the fashion show was 'outdoors' and in the 'daylight.'\n\nKim then explained that she thinks Khlo\u00e9 may be suffering from agoraphobia, though it's not clear if she thought it might be a clinical case, or just that her sister is turning into a homebody.\n\n'I get it, but it's time to break out of it,' she added with audible annoyance.\n\nKim noted that she is officially a brand ambassador for Balenciaga, even though people had assumed she was long before that after she began wearing numerous outfits from the Spanish fashion house.\n\nKim's ex-husband Kanye West had previously collaborated with Balenciaga, but the luxury fashion line severed their ties in 2022 in the wake of antisemitic comments the rapper made.\n\nKim also noted that she was getting ready to pitch a new comedy film, which she will presumably star in, so she was branching out and even busier than usual.\n\nWhile she was at the fashion show, it cuts away to reveal other stars walking with the models, including Brigitte Nielsen and Cardi B.\n\nAfter her time at the Balenciaga show, Kendall was seen driving over to her younger sister Kylie Jenner's house.\n\nKendall brought along an adorably fluffy puppy, which they wanted to introduce to their mother Kris Jenner's dog Bridgette.\n\nBridgette, like the puppy, appeared to be a poodle mix, and Kylie and Kendall admitted they had always wanted to style Bridgette like a traditional poodle with most of her hair trimmed short and accented with longer poofs.\n\n'Hair grows, why not at least try,' Kendall said.\n\nKylie worried that their mother might be furious if she suddenly discovered her dog had gotten a drastic haircut, though Kendall thought their reality show might help them out of a jam.\n\n'Because the cameras are on, I don't think she'll get that mad,' Kendall added.\n\n'I think I'm good at pranks...' Kylie later said in a confessional, though she sounded unsure of herself and trailed off.\n\nThe two made their way over to Kris' home and snuck in before calling out for Bridgette.\n\nThe dog cautiously turned a corner and started to walk toward them, but Kendall and Kylie were disappointed to see that she had recently had a haircut, so her hair was too short for their intended cut.\n\nThey ran into another obstacle when Kris' boyfriend Corey Gamble appeared and looked confused about why they were in the house unannounced.\n\nThen they met in the kitchen to fess up.\n\n'We came over here to... steal Bridget... and the groomer's waiting at my house to cut her like a poodle,' Kylie admitted haltingly to Kris, who seemed more surprised than angry.\n\n'How can you not prank me? It's so easy!' Kris added in confessional. 'What the f*** is wrong with you guys?'\n\nBut Kylie vowed that they would think of a more substantial prank later.\n\nAs they were leaving with the puppy, Kylie let out a high-pitched squeak that confused Kris, and she head to explain that it was a hiccup.\n\n'That's your hiccup?!' Kris responded, as she had apparently never heard the unusual mouse-like squeal, and Kendall admitted that she sounded the same when she hiccuped.\n\nThe sisters left their mom's house and headed back to Kylie's abode to unwind, but the conversation took a darker, more emotional turn as the cosmetics mogul made a major confession.\n\nKylie, who was wearing a chic dark blue denim jacket and matching jeans, noted that it's hard to spend time with her sisters because they're so busy.\n\n'Well that was a failure,' she said as Kendall agreed that they were the 'worst prankers.'\n\n'But, I love hanging out with you!' Kylie said.\n\nBut then she confessed that it was a 'miracle' that she still had any 'confidence' left and that she could look in a mirror and 'think that I'm pretty.'\n\nKylie complained to her sister about how people had been making fun of her online after she stepped out in the City of Lights for Paris Fashion Week.\n\nShe said a photo had gone around of herself after she decided not to wear a lot of makeup.\n\nKylie said that if she wore a lot of makeup, people would she she was wearing 'too much makeup,' but if she went in the opposite direction, people would also criticize her on social media.\n\nIn particular, she was hurt that fans -- as well as cosmetic dermatologists and professionals experienced with injecting fillers and botox -- had pointed out diagonal lines running through her plump cheeks\n\nSome fans and professionals had speculated that she had used too much filler below her eyes and over her cheek bones, creating the prominent crease.\n\nHowever, the lines can be visible on anyone, even in children, and Kylie claimed that the feature had always been prominent on her going back to when she was a child.\n\n'I just hear nasty things about myself all the time,' Kylie admitted in the confessional interview.\n\nThe billionaire reality star and cosmetics mogul wondered aloud to her sister why people didn't more prominently defend her online.\n\n'I'm kind of like, so numb to people talking about my looks at this point, and I just want to know why on the internet no one says anything or thinks that it's OK,' she said.\n\nKendall said it was an issue for the whole family, and they were 'dehumanized' in the public eye.\n\n'They don't think that there are any rules with us,' sh said, adding that people don't think they have 'any feelings.'\n\n'If you talked the same way you talk about us about any other woman, people would come to their defense all day long,' Kendall added.\n\nKylie was particularly upset because she was trying to find a new, more natural looking, and she confessed to being on a 'journey' over the past year in which she dissolved 'half' of her lip filler.\n\n'I think with me it's never going to change,' Kylie said, before pausing as tears started to well up in her eyes.\n\nAs she brushed them away, Kendall took a seat next to hear and wrapped her in a hug.\n\n'Why do people think it's OK to talk about me?' Kylie asked through her tears.\n\nShe said she hadn't cried about the mean comments before, and as the tears slowed she shared how she occasionally sees defensive comments, but others claim online that it's fine to criticize her looks because 'she did it to herself.'\n\n'\"She f***ed up her face. She has so much surgery,\"' she recalls reading.\n\nKylie said people had complained about her looks even before she got fillers, and she seemed distressed that people say she looks 'old,' though Kendall claimed she looked younger than ever.\n\nThe model said they would never get past the comments, as people would always assume they had both gotten 'full facial reconstructions.'\n\n'I can't let the comments get me down,' Kylie said. 'I can't let the comments get me down. I have s*** to do. Rise above.'\n\nThen the action cut to Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian ahead of a brief exit from her mansion.\n\n'Breaking news, guys! I am leaving Hidden Hills!' she gushed, but she wasn't going far from home, and her excuse was that Kourtney might go into labor at any moment.\n\nThe Revenge body star was taking a trip to see some baby goats at a petting zoo with her BFF Malika Haqq, who joined her in the passenger seat of her Rolls-Royce.\n\nThe two got to talking about Malika recent dating attempts, after she paused her plans to use a sperm bank to help her have a child.\n\n'I am not open for business -- you are!' Khlo\u00e9 said, as she emphasized that she wanted to be single for a while.\n\nBut she was happy for her friend and approved of her trying to find a real partner before resulting to an anonymous sperm donor.\n\nWhile they talked about a date that didn't end well with an insistent suitor who wouldn't stop texting Malika, Khloe admitted that she had been turned on when her ex-husband Lamar Odom found out they had the same business manager and sought out her contact info after she wouldn't give him her number. She found his persistence sexy.\n\nWhile driving, Khlo\u00e9 also complained that they couldn't have as much fun in public anymore because there are phones everywhere now.\n\nIn a confessional, Khloe admitted she didn't want to start dating again because it might 'f*** up' her kids, and she had been disappointed by her recent romantic interests.\n\nBack at the goat farm, Khlo\u00e9 gushed over how 'cute' the little animals were.\n\n'True would die,' Khlo\u00e9 said, before FaceTiming her daughter, who clearly loved the animals, even as they tried to eat Khlo\u00e9's jacket and bite Malika.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 admitted she 'definitely didn't think everything through,' such as how the goats 'poop little pellets' and 'pee everywhere' and have a tendency to hump each other.\n\n'Classic Carl,' an employee said of one particularly sexed-up goat.\n\n'Pets and men are two different things,' Khlo\u00e9 said, because pets only require food and petting.\n\nWhile at the farm, a group of visiting school children saw Khlo\u00e9 and shouted her name.\n\nShe said 'hi' back to them and gave a group of young girls a big hug.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 had a 'hard time' believing eight- or nine-year-old girls would know who she was, but she still spent a few minutes with them and gave them high fives.\n\nBack in the confessional, she told her producer that she '100 percent' expects to be married again in the future.\n\nThe final -- and longest -- section of the episode was devoted to her sister Kourtney Kardashian, her husband Travis Barker and the birth of their first child together, whom they had named Rocky.\n\nOn October 29, 2023, Kourtney and Travis were sitting in bed looking at old photos of themselves on his phone when she announced that she had had a contraction.\n\n'My baby's about to pop,' Travis said gleefully.\n\nHe said it would be the first 'natural birth' he had experienced, and he said he would be filming Rocky as he was born.\n\nBut Kourtney objected, saying she didn't want him to be 'down there.'\n\nShe said she didn't want Travis to be 'traumatized by your favorite thing in the world.'\n\nLater that night the lovebirds drove to the hospital, and Kourtney joked that Rocky was waiting for a Halloween birthday.\n\nBoth parents guessed that Rocky would weigh exactly eight pounds.\n\nThen Kourtney looked back to a traumatic event months earlier when doctors had discovered fluid in Rocky's lungs, which was 'super rare,' but they were 'lucky' to have caught it.\n\nKourtney filmed herself on her phone from her hospital bed and admitted she was 'filled with fear' after the surgery.\n\nThings seemed to take a downturn when the fluid returned to Rocky's lungs.\n\nBut then Kourtney saw a video on the power of positive thinking, and after she tried to focus on optimistic thoughts, she claimed that the fluid had completely disappeared.\n\n'It's time to go,' she whispered then as she prepared to birth Rocky.\n\nA nurse attending to her said she was one to two centimeters dilated and had some bleeding, which didn't concern her.\n\nBut then it was 10 in the morning on October 30, and Kourtney revealed that she had gotten up to three centimeters dilated by 4 a.m., but there was no progress after that.\n\nShe was seen bouncing on a big rubber ball in her hospital gown and moving in circles to stimulate the labor while talking on the phone with her family.\n\nKourtney even wondered if she should cool it with the ball exercises, as she really wanted Rocky to wait until Halloween.\n\n'You better squeeze him out, baby's gonna be 10 pounds,' Travis joked as the morning progressed.\n\nThey decided to leave the hospital while things were stalled, but first they left to eat at Crossroads.\n\nOnce they were home, Kourtney revealed that they showered and then had sex.\n\n'That helps sometimes,' she said with a sly smile.\n\nFinally, it was October 31, and Travis told Kourtney that Rocky 'thinks today is the day.'\n\nBut he had second thoughts on the way back to the hospital.\n\n'We said it too much that his birthday was gonna be on Halloween,' Travis mused on the ride over.\n\nThe Blink-182 member had an odd way of calming his nerves while he waited for Kourtney to go into labor.\n\nHe had brought along his drum practice pad and began banging out rudiments at the the same tempo as Rocky's heartbeat.\n\nMany women in labor might have found the din unbearably annoying, but Kourtney was on the same page as her husband.\n\nShe said she found the drumming soothing, and she said Travis' practice had helped her fall asleep in the past.\n\nBefore Rocky arrived, she reflected that they were 'too afraid to feel it' after she got pregnant because they worried it was 'too good to be true,' especially after they had given up on IVF treatments.\n\nWhile she was on her side in her hospital bed and being attended to by a nurse, a faint splashing sound was heard on the soundtrack, and Kourtney said she finally broke her water, indicating that Rocky was arriving soon.\n\nKourtney had planned for Travis to be the only family member with her in the delivery room, but her plans had a major shake up after a surprise guest arrived -- her mother Kris.\n\nDespite gatecrashing the birth, Kris tried to be innocuous by sitting on the other side of the room while masked up and looking at her phone.\n\nIn her confessional interview, Kourtney revealed that she got a surprise call from her security that her mother had arrived at the hospital and wanted to join her.\n\nKris told the guard she was 'just in the area,' so she decided to drop in on the birth.\n\n'She was not in the area,' Kourtney grumbled, although she didn't have the heart to ban her mother from getting to see her grandson be born.\n\nAs she waited for the big moment after reaching four centimeters dilation, Kourtney confessed to Travis that she had been craving some Ritz Bits crackers since the day before.\n\nAs it got closer and closer to midnight, Kourtney admitted: 'I think Rocky wants to be November first.'\n\nTravis agreed: 'Yeah, he doesn't want to be the King of Halloween.'\n\nBut there was still a slim chance after her doctor decided to induce her at 11:45 p.m.\n\nKourtney was surprised when Travis, who had been playing music in the hospital room all night, switched to exclusively Frank Sinatra as Rocky's arrival was imminent.\n\nDespite her best efforts, Kourtney gave birth just one minute too late for the baby to be the Halloween King, and Rocky Thirteen Barker entered the world at 12:00 a.m. on November 1.\n\nAfter the lengthy birthing process and the joyous moment of meeting Rocky, Kris comforted her daughter in her inimitable way.\n\n'Do you want a Cheez-It or whatever you call them?' she asked her daughter\n\nBut Kourtney admitted later that she was glad her mother was there, as Kris had a calming effect over the proceedings.\n\nLater, during her confessional interview, Kourtney paused to FaceTime Travis, and he gushed that Rocky's birth was 'one of the best days' of his life.\n\nHe added that he wanted to watch the show's footage of the birth.\n\n'I want to know what song he popped out to,' Travis explained.\n\nThey determined the song was Sinatra's performance of That's Life, the title track of his classic 1966 LP\n\n'The song just came up in the playlist and we were like, \"What a perfect song,\"' Kourtney recalled.\n\nAs Travis sat in the hospital bed and cuddled little Rocky, Kourtney beamed with love for him after the fact during her interview.\n\n'I have the most amazing and supportive husband I could ever dream of,' she said sweetly.\n\nShe gave thanks, adding that 'the way that it all happened is just such a reminder that God's timing is everything.'\n\nIn the preview for next week's episode, Kim plans the family's popular Christmas Eve Party with imported snow for a full white Christmas, but thunder on the horizon threatens to ruin the outdoor bash.\n\nMeanwhile, Khlo\u00e9 was once again at home with her kids and her brother Rob Kardashian's daughter Dream.\n\nWhile visiting her, Kim claimed Khlo\u00e9's kids rule her life.\n\n'Live your f***ing life! Get out!' she shouted at her younger sister.\n\nThen all the women were about to take a family vacation, but something went awry as Kylie joined them on the private jet.\n\n'I just have a really bad feeling,' Kylie confessed, before getting off the plane with no explanation.\n\nThe very last moment of the episode was a humorous tag in which one of Khlo\u00e9's confessional interviews was interrupted by a spider descending in front of her.\n\nLuckily, a crew member apprehended it and saved her, but not before they poked fun at her frightened expression with a freeze frame.", "source":

Kim also revealed that she has a ten-year plan for her newfound passion.\n\n\"I can do a movie a year,\" Kardashian said in a confessional. \"I've got about ten years where I still look good, so that's all I've got in me and then I'll take some time off.\" In ten years, Kim will be 53.

It also seems completely feasible for Kim, who told friends at dinner that studio offers were immediately rolling in after she, Pell, and Brito were done pitching.

That would be epic.'\n\nBut - despite stating she 'really loved' the idea of taking over from Daniel Craig, Kim admitted her Botox procedures could put a stop to her Hollywood career.\n\nShe joked: 'I also feel like you need less Botox for more emotion, and I don't have it.'\n\nA The Kardashians producer then grilled Kim about her James Bond future in a confessional, with the Skims founder doubling down on her ambition.\n\nWhen asked if she would make a 'great 007', the reality TV star replied: 'Totally.'\n\nOn The Kardashians, Kim revealed that offers from acting agents began pouring in after she starred in American Horror Story alongside Emma Roberts.\n\nShe has even pitched comedy film The Fifth Wheel, in which she stars and producers, to movie studios, eventally accepting an offer with Netflix.\n\nWritten by SNL's Paula Pell and Janine Brito, Kim compared the project to The Hangover and Bridesmaids.\n\nKim is also slated to star in a show - created specifically for her by American Horror Story's Ryan Murphy - about a divorce lawyer who leads an all-female firm.\n\nAccording to Deadline, Hulu has commissioned the show with a 'big series commitment.'\n\nMeanwhile, the hunt for James Bond continues with Aaron remaining the favourite to take on the role according to betideas.com, which puts his odds at 4/6.\n\nOther serious contenders include Henry Cavill (7/2) and James Norton (5/1).\n\nThe Kardashians is available to stream on Disney Plus.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us

However, she planned on doing so in the next ten years, according to her bold declaration in the latest episode of Hulu's \"The Kardashians.\"\n\n\"I can do a movie a year,\" she told the cameras with a laugh, \"I've got about 10 years where I still look good, so that's all I've got in me, and then I'll take some time off.\"\n\nKardashian shared more details about her plans during a dinner date with her \"lifer\" group of friends, revealing she had teamed up with \"SNL\" alum Paula Pell to sell a new comedy movie to Netflix.\n\nShe described the movie \"The Fifth Wheel\" as a \"full comedy,\" with an ensemble related to hit films like \"The Hangover,\" \"Bridesmaids,\" \"The First Wives Club,\" and more.\n\nPell wrote the script with her wife and creative partner, Janine Brito, and will co-produce with Kardashian, per ET.\n\nWhen her friends expressed surprise at Kardashian's big news, the socialite echoed similar sentiments. She confessed to being nervous about her acting career, which she had not originally planned to pursue.\n\n\"I wasn't planning on this career, and I was like, 'OK, I'm not gonna get ahead of myself here.' I'm really nervous about it because I have to f-cking deliver,\" she said, adding: \"Every year, I want to do something that makes me so uncomfortable that I really have to challenge myself.\"\n\nKardashian's pals encouraged her to reach for the stars in her acting pursuits, claiming she could take on any challenge. They even dropped ideas like her tackling a female James Bond; however, she shut down the role, saying:\n\n\"I feel like you need less Botox for more emotion, and I do not have that. How am I gonna be scared? How am I gonna cry?\"\n\nNews of Kardashian's comedy project first broke in November 2023, with The Blast reporting that she actively participated in the sale. After an intense bidding war involving theatrical distributors and streamers, Netflix emerged victorious, securing the rights to \"The Fifth Wheel.\"\n\nKardashian was reportedly deeply involved in the sales process, actively presenting the female-driven comedy at each meeting and attracting studios eager to collaborate with her.\n\nHer role did not end there, as sources noted that with her co-producer chair, the reality TV star was expected to engage in the marketing strategy actively. Meanwhile, her ad agency would collaborate with Netflix to amplify the promotional efforts for \"The Fifth Wheel.\"\n\nFollowing her performance in \"American Horror Story: Delicate,\" Kardashian received applause from fans across social media platforms. Many were impressed by her exceptional portrayal of the sinister publicist, Siobhan Corbyn, with someone declaring:\n\n\"Dare I say, Kim was not bad. She delivered her lines pretty cleanly. She gave the character some life and wasn't as monotone as we're used to seeing her. Kudos.\"\n\nAnother supporter echoed: \"Yessss b-tch!!! I've been waiting on a good season of AHS, and omg they delivered! Episode 1 was so good! Emma Roberts and Kim Kardashian were fabulous! Kim really ate that role up! She's giving Academy Award nominee.\"\n\n\"Kim Kardashian did her thing. She had the odds stacked against her, but she was really giving actress,\" a third chimed. Kardashian has voiced two \"Paw Patrol\" films and starred in Tyler Perry's \"Temptation: Confessions Of A Marriage Counselor.\n\nEarlier in June, The Blast reported that Kardashian sat down to be interviewed by fellow actress Chlo\u00eb Sevigny for an episode of Variety's \"Actors on Actors\" series.\n\nDuring their emotional conversation, the TV personality spoke about an ex-publicist who didn't believe in her skills.\n\n\"I've had two. One always told me to be more realistic about my goals and always just didn't believe in me,\"she recalled, \"And so she asked me one time when I was in her office, like, 'Oh, well, what's your goal? Like, what where do you see yourself?'\"\n\n\"And I really didn't know, but there was some magazines, and there was like a Cosmo magazine, and it was like at the beginning. And I just said, 'I don't know, I'd love to be on a magazine like that,'\" Kardashian continued, noting her publicist replied:\" 'Oh, no, no. We need some realistic goals.'\"", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri": "afouda_bamidele@theblast.com", "name": "Afouda Bamidele", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Pell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paula Pell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_5th_Wheel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The 5th Wheel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Horror_Story:_Delicate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Horror Story: Delicate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Murphy_(filmmaker)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Murphy (filmmaker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kardashians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Kardashians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping_Up_with_the_Kardashians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Wives_Club_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Wives Club (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socialite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAW_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PAW Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Perry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Perry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Temptations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Temptations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Publicist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlo\u00eb_Sevigny", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chlo\u00eb Sevigny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emma Roberts"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Comedy", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Comedy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/brand-img/123/1608x742/2024/06/20093531/Kim-Kardashian-scaled-e1718890820646.jpg?", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667019", "eventUri": "eng-9667019", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

And, most recently, she's shifted her focus yet again to become one of Hollywood's next big actresses.\n\nOpening up about the career change on a recent episode of The Kardashians, however, the mom of four admitted to a few conditions she has as she looks for new roles after her acting debut in American Horror Story.\n\nAccording to Kardashian, while she's invested in acting now, she can't see herself acting for too long. \"I can do a movie a year, I've got about 10 years where I still look good, so that's all I've got in me and then I'll take some time off,\" she said, per People. \"That's my 10-year plan.\"\n\n\"I feel like you need less Botox for more emotion and I don't have it,\" the SKIMS founder then joked to her friends, adding \"I'm not gonna be gaining 500 lbs. for a role... that's not where I need to be.\"\n\nConditions aside, it seems Kardashian, who's in talks to star and produce a comedy movie titled The Fifth Wheel, is still hesitant about herself as an actress. \"How am I gonna cry?\" she asked. \"How am I gonna be scared out of my mind?\"\n\n\"I wasn't planning on this career and was like, I'm not gonna get ahead of myself here,\" she explained in a confessional. \"I'm really nervous about it 'cause I have to f -- deliver. It's such a challenge for me and I want to welcome a challenge, and I'm like, every year I want to do something that makes me so uncomfortable that I really have to challenge myself.\"\n\nKardashian then explained that this specific career change was because of her agent, Brad Slater. \"I was not expecting this career turn, it really did take me by surprise, and I think we all have Brad Slater to thank for this,\" she said. \"You want a Brad Slater in your corner, he thinks the world of me.\"\n\nIn the episode, Kardashian also opened up about producing The Fifth Wheel and pitching the movie to different studios. \"If it happens and it works out, I will feel really accomplished and feel really fulfilled, but who knows?\" she said of the film. \"This is just new to me, I'm a little bit green to this.\"\n\nProps to her for keeping herself grounded, and always being up for a challenge!", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri": "giovana_gelhoren@sheknows.com", "name": "Giovana Gelhoren", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kardashians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Kardashians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Hilton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Hilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Horror_Story", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Horror Story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Perry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Katy Perry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_5th_Wheel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The 5th Wheel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Outplacement", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Outplacement", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/kim-kardashian-1.png?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667019", "eventUri": "eng-9667019", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

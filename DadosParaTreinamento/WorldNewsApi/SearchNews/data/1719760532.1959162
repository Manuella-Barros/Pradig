{"id": 225617568, "title": "Melinda French Gates Plans to Donate $1 Bil. to Abortion, Gender & Social Justice to \u2018Help\u2019 Girls", "text": "Melinda French Gates, ex-wife of billionaire Bill Gates, announced Tuesday that she plans to donate $1 billion to various organizations that claim to \u201csupport\u201d women and girls around the world. To no one\u2019s surprise, French Gates' organizations of choice promote far-left policies like changing your gender and killing your kids. French Gates plans to leave the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the foundation she co-founded with her ex-husband, at some point next week. With her departure, and the divorce, French Gates is set to receive $12.5 billion from Gates - hence her announcement regarding where she plans to give money to. As AP News noted, French Gates will be making donations through her Pivotal Ventures group. Pivotal noted how the $1 billion will be allocated: $200 million to existing U.S. nonprofits supporting women and girls: Center for Reproductive Rights, Collaborative for Gender + Reproductive Equity, Collective Future Fund, Community Change, Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, MomsRising Education Fund, Ms. Foundation for Women, National Domestic Workers Alliance, National Partnership for Women & Families, National Women\u2019s Law Center, New America, The 19th, Roosevelt Institute, States United Democracy Center, Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, and Washington Center for Equitable Growth. $240 million, in $20 million grants to each of these global leaders: Dr. Alfiee Breland-Noble, founder of The AAKOMA Project; Olympic gold medalist Allyson Felix; filmmaker Ava DuVernay; Crystal Echo Hawk, founder of IllumiNative; Gary Barker, founder of Equimundo: Center for Masculinities and Social Justice; Hauwa Ojeifo, founder of She Writes Woman; former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern; Nobel Peace Laureate Leymah Roberta Gbowee; M. V. Lee Badgett, founding partner of Koppa: The LGBTI+ Economic Power Lab; Richard V. Reeves, founding president of the American Institute for Boys and Men; Sabrina Habib, co-founder and CEO of Kidogo; and Shabana Basij-Rasikh, co-founder of the School of Leadership Afghanistan. $250 million to be awarded to organizations working to improve women\u2019s mental and physical health worldwide, selected through an open call with Lever for Change this fall. (Note: Bolded are the obviously woke organizations and people, but many of the others promote or endorse woke ideologies as well.) The Center for Reproductive Rights is a global advocacy group who advocates for abortion to be available worldwide. On its website, it noted proudly, that \u201csince 2021, as a result of the Center\u2019s work, 1.7 billion people have stronger legal protections for abortion.\u201d Seems like an odd thing to be proud of. Another woke group French Gates is sending money to is the Collaborative for Gender + Reproductive Equity (CGRE). That group works to accelerate things like transgenderism, Black Lives Matter (BLM) propaganda, abortion and other progressive ideologies. French Gates also plans to donate a $20 million grant to M.V. Lee Badgett, who is a founding partner of Koppa: The LGBTQI+ Economic Power Lab, which has a mission to \u201cunleash global LGBTI+ economic power through knowledge, financing and connection.\u201d In plain English, the group aims to push progressivism throughout the world. While you and I see how these causes don\u2019t actually help women and girls but rather push the idea that life has no meaning, individual needs come first and delusions should be celebrated. The media, especially CBS, loved French Gates\u2019 plans. On Wednesday, \"CBS Mornings\" highlighted how French Gates plans to \u201chelp protect women\u2019s rights\u201d by bringing on the founder of \u201cThe 19th,\u201d which is an independent journalism outlet that supposedly gives women and gays information and tools on how to \u201cparticipate in our democracy.\u201d On \"The Daily Report with John Dickerson\" for CBS, Dickerson noted that French Gates is working to \u201csupport\u201d women and girls too. I\u2019m still unsure how helping women kill their kids and live a lie is a way of showing \u201csupport.\u201d \"CBS Evenings\" puffed up the move as well, calling it a \u201chistoric\u201d type of \u201cpledge.\u201d \"CBS Evening News\" noted that French Gates is \u201cconcerned her one year-old granddaughter will grow up with fewer rights than she has\u201d and spoke highly of how French Gates plans to help push abortion with her $1B donation. Right after French Gates noted where she plans to allocate her donations, \"CBS Mornings\" called it a \u201cstunning announcement\u201d that shows that she\u2019s \u201ccommitted to advocating for women and girls.\u201d Hosts on the show also noted that her move \u201cshows you what the stakes are and why somebody like Melinda Gates French would choose to take up this battle [abortion \u2018rights\u2019] and devote a lot of her wealth to the battle. Well, it\u2019s clear CBS is in love with French Gates\u2019 pledge to do what I would consider is the opposite of \u201csupporting\u201d women and girls. If she really wanted to help women and girls, French Gates could've easily given money to adoption groups, to kids in foster care, to pregnancy centers or to women who need financial and physical support after choosing life. THAT would've actually been \"support.\"", "summary": "Melinda French Gates, ex-wife of billionaire Bill Gates, announced Tuesday that she plans to donate $1 billion to various organizations that claim to \u201csupport\u201d women and girls around the world.

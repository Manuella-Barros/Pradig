In the video, Jennie was seen bringing a black object to her mouth and exhaling what appears to be smoke while getting her makeup done.\n\nNetizens speculated that the object that Jennie was holding was an e-cigarette and that the smoke was tobacco smoke. Jennie was smoking in close proximity to the makeup artist's face.\n\nThis scene was part of a vlog titled \"A Moment in Capri with Jennie,\" uploaded to Jennie's YouTube channel, Jennierubyjane Official, last Tuesday. The scene has since been deleted from the video.\n\nAccording to the National Health Promotion Act, office buildings, factories and complex buildings with a total floor area of at least 1,000 square meters or more are designated as non-smoking areas. Smoking indoors in these buildings can result in a fine of up to 100,000 won ($72).\n\nSome netizens defended Jennie, stating that smoking is a personal freedom and that the controversy is an overreaction stemming from discrimination against female smokers. They also argued that since the scene was likely filmed on the island of Capri in Italy, indoor smoking was not a legal issue.\n\nSome reacted by stating that smoking in front of others, regardless of the location, is inappropriate. Comments on online communities included, \"Blowing smoke in the staff's face is rude,\" \"Can't she wait until the makeup is done?\" \"What is she doing in an enclosed space?\" and \"Why can't the staff, whose livelihoods depend on this, raise their voices?\"\n\nOne netizen claimed to have reported Jennie's indoor smoking to the Korean embassy in Italy, calling for strict punishment.\n\nD.O., an actor and member of the boy band EXO, was fined after being reported for smoking an e-cigarette in the waiting room of MBC's \"Show! Music Core\" last year.\n\nActor Ji Chang-wook also apologized after being shown smoking indoors in a making-of video for the JTBC drama \" Welcome to Samdal-ri\" (2023-24).\n\nBY KIM MIN-YOUNG [kim.minyoung5@joongang.co.kr]", "source": {"uri": "koreajoongangdaily.joins.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\uc911\uc559\uc77c\ubcf4"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpink", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blackpink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Capri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Girl group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vlog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netizen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netizen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.O._(entertainer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D.O.

Captured from online community\n\nNetizens criticize inconsiderate behavior despite overseas lawsBy KTimes\n\nBLACKPINK member Jennie is embroiled in controversy after being spotted allegedly smoking indoors during an overseas schedule.\n\nVarious online communities rapidly spread a video that appeared to show Jennie smoking indoors on Monday.\n\nIn the video, Jennie is receiving makeup and hair touch-ups from staff. During this process, she is seen holding an object presumed to be an electronic cigarette, taking a puff, and exhaling smoke.\n\nThis footage was part of Jennie's YouTube vlog posted on July 2, but the scene has since been deleted. According to the National Health Promotion Act, office buildings and mixed-use buildings with a floor area of 1,000 square meters or more are designated as non-smoking areas.\n\nSmoking indoors in these areas can result in a fine of up to 100,000 won ($80).\n\nHowever, since Jennie was fulfilling her schedule overseas at the time, domestic laws do not apply.\n\nDespite this, there has been significant criticism that Jennie's actions were inconsiderate of the staff attending to her face and hair.\n\nNetizens in online communities have been sharply criticizing Jennie, with comments such as, \"Do celebrities think indoor smoking is standard?\" and \"Even if you want to smoke, hold off.\"\n\n'Complaint with Korean embassy in Italy'\n\nSeparately, other media outlets reported that a netizen identified as \"A\" posted a notice on an online community. In the post, A claimed that Jennie's indoor smoking scene, which is currently controversial, likely took place at a recent shooting site on Capri Island, Italy.\n\nThe netizen also mentioned having requested an investigation through the National Petition Portal to the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in Italy.\n\nThe author also uploaded a screenshot showing that the complaint had been submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nIn the complaint, \"A\" urged, \"The Embassy of the Republic of Korea in Italy should request an investigation from the Italian authorities regarding BLACKPINK Jennie's indoor smoking incident and take strict action.\"\n\nIn the past, actor Ji Chang-wook and singer Do Kyung-soo also faced controversy and issued apologies for smoking indoors.

Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Coachella/AFP\n\nA now-deleted video showing K-pop megastar Jennie of BLACKPINK apparently smoking a vape indoors has sparked online outcry, with Seoul's foreign ministry telling AFP Tuesday it had received a formal complaint.\n\nIn the footage, uploaded as part of a live blog on YouTube for fans but subsequently removed even as copies of it spread across the internet, Jennie appears to exhale vape smoke while a bevvy of hair and make-up artists work closely on her face.\n\nSmoking cigarettes or vapes indoors is illegal in South Korea and the footage triggered headlines and online outrage, with \"indoor smoking\" and \"BLACKPINK Jennie\" becoming top trending topics on X in the South.\n\n\"Controversy over Jennie's indoor smoking... exhaling smoke in the face of her staff,\" was the headline of the Yonhap news agency's report on the incident, typical of the widespread reporting in Korean-language media.\n\nOne internet user claimed the incident likely happened in Italy's Capri, where Jennie had been filming, and said they had requested that the South Korean Embassy in Italy and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs probe the BLACKPINK star, the Korea Times reported.\n\nThe user urged Seoul to request \"an investigation from the Italian authorities regarding BLACKPINK's Jennie's indoor smoking incident and take strict action,\" the report said.\n\nSouth Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told AFP on Tuesday that they had received a petition related to the incident.\n\nBLACKPINK is one of South Korea's most successful K-pop girl groups, with their songs topping charts both locally and internationally.\n\nBLACKPINK's other achievements include being the first K-pop girl group to reach the top of the US Billboard 200 chart, and the first Asian artists to headline prestigious music events such as Coachella.\n\n\"Posting such a video on her own SNS channel raises serious questions about her common sense... It is deeply disappointing,\" said one commentator on South Korean portal Naver.\n\nSmoking rates are relatively high in South Korea, but according to official data, as of 2022, only five percent of South Korean women smoke, compared to 30 percent of men.\n\nSouth Korean pop stars undergo rigorous training for years before their debut and are held to high behavioural standards, with smoking, dating and swearing largely forbidden, especially in the first years following their debut.\n\nJennie has previously confessed to struggling with these expectations.\n\n\"It's really harsh,\" Jennie, who debuted with BLACKPINK in 2016, said in a Netflix documentary.\n\n\"We were not allowed to drink, smoke or get a tattoo,\" she recalled of her training period, adding that she had to endure \"being told that I'm not good at stuff\".", "source": {"uri": "tribune.net.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@tribune.net.ph", "name":

While fans appreciated her natural beauty in the video, an unexpected scenario caught further attention.\n\nJennie of BLACKPINK has issued an apology for vaping indoors through her newly launched agency, ODD ATELIER. The K-pop idol acknowledged the incident and expressed her deepest regrets.\n\nEarlier today, ODD ATELIER (OA) released an official statement with Jennie's apology regarding the incident. The agency stated, \"We sincerely apologize to everyone who felt uncomfortable with Jennie's actions in the content released on the 2nd.\"\n\nJennie was captured vaping in Italy.\n\nIn her statement, Jennie admitted to vaping indoors, saying, \"Jennie acknowledges and deeply regrets her mistake of vaping indoors and causing inconvenience to the staff. Jennie has personally apologized to all the staff on-site who may have been affected.\"\n\nThe controversy began on July 2 when Jennie shared a vlog of her Italy trip on her YouTube channel. While fans appreciated her natural beauty in the video, an unexpected scenario caught further attention. Some netizens noticed that Jennie was holding a dark-coloured device to her lips, which appeared to be an electronic cigarette or vape, while getting her hair and makeup done inside a studio-like setting. In the following frame, she was seen exhaling smoke.\n\nAlso Read- Happy ARMY Day: BTS' j-Hope pens an emotional letter ahead of his discharge from military\n\nAlthough fans recognised that Jennie, as an adult, has the right to smoke, the outrage stemmed from the fact that she was doing so indoors. Smoking indoors is prohibited in many countries, including South Korea and Italy, where Jennie was at the time.\n\nShortly after the backlash began, Jennie edited her vlog to remove the scenes where she was seen vaping indoors. However, the damage had already been done, and the incident had gone viral.\n\nJennie recently established her own music label, Odd Atelier, to further explore her solo career while remaining an active member of BLACKPINK. She expressed excitement about her new venture, aiming to showcase a new side of herself and release music for her fans.\n\nJennie also collaborated with BLACK B's Zico on the song Spot, which topped local charts in South Korea, and she achieved her first entry into the Billboard 100 chart with her feature on One of the Girls. Additionally, she teased her fans with a snippet of her upcoming solo album on her Instagram story.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlog", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vlog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpink", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blackpink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_idol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Korean idol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netizen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netizen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BTS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zico_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zico (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Hot 100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2024/07/20240709161715_Slideshow-17.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716980", "eventUri": "eng-9716980", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-02", "textStart": 25, "textEnd": 31, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

This is OA Entertainment. We sincerely apologize to everyone who felt uncomfortable with Jennie's actions in the content released on the 2nd.

We apologize to her fans who have been disappointed through this incident. We hope to prevent this from reoccurring in the future,\" the statement read.\n\nThe controversy started on July 8, when a video clip of Kim blowing a vape indoors -- while several hair and make-up artists were working closely on her face -- spread across social media and online communities. The video has been taken down.\n\nAccording to AFP via The Korea Times, one internet user claimed the incident most likely happened in Capri, Italy, where Jennie was filming. The user also requested \"an investigation from the Italian authorities regarding Blackpink member Jennie's indoor smoking incident and take strict action,\" the report said.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nThe South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, meanwhile, told AFP on Tuesday, that they had received a petition similar to the incident.\n\nSmoking or vaping indoors in South Korea is illegal. South Korea adopted a law in 2015 prohibiting smoking inside public spaces. There are penalties for violating the anti-smoking law, depending on how serious the violation was, the fine could range from anything from KRW 100,000 to KRW 5 million. In South Korea, there is also a growing perception that smoking is an undesirable social behavior. Smokers may experience rejection from others or judgment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim previously admitted that she was struggling with these expectations, in a Netflix documentary in 2016 when Blackpink debuted.\n\n\"It's really harsh,\" Jennie said in a Netflix documentary.\n\nShe also recalled her training period, saying, \"We were not allowed to drink, smoke, or get a tattoo.\" She also added that she had to put up with \"being told that I'm not good at stuff.\"", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "viany_faro@manilatimes.net", "name": "Viany Faro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpink", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blackpink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennie_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennie (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Korea_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Korea Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Capri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manila_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Manila Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(South_Korea)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (South Korea)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korean_won", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korean won"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2024/07/11/372435.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716980", "eventUri": "eng-9716980", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "textStart": 763, "textEnd": 769}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The debate has sparked varied reactions, with opinions split on whether it's a big deal or not.\n\nBLACKPINK's Jennie is making headlines for a recent incident captured in a now-deleted video. The K-pop star was filmed smoking what appears to be an electronic cigarette while getting her hair and make-up done for a vlog. In the clip, Jennie is seen holding a dark device to her lips, drawing a cloud of vapour as she chatted casually. The video quickly circulated online, sparking significant discussion among fans and critics alike. Although Jennie is legally allowed to use a vape, the indoor setting of the smoking has raised eyebrows. Many South Korean regulations, as well as laws in other countries including Italy, where the video was shot, ban smoking in enclosed spaces.

Some fans argue that Jennie's actions were a minor oversight, while others believe it sets a poor example for younger audiences who look up to her. The incident also highlights the strict anti-smoking laws prevalent in South Korea and abroad. Jennie's team has yet to address the situation publicly, leaving fans to speculate on the potential repercussions for the star and her future vlogs.

The video, which has since been edited to remove the offending scene, captured the 28-year-old K-pop star using a vape indoors while being attended to by hair and makeup artists. This incident has sparked significant backlash, given that indoor smoking, including the use of vape devices, is prohibited in South Korea.\n\nIn response to the growing criticism, Jennie's record label and company, OA (Odd Atelier), issued a formal apology on July 9 via social media platform X. The statement read, \"We sincerely apologize to everyone who felt uncomfortable with Jennie's actions in the content released on the 2nd. Jennie acknowledges and deeply regrets her mistake of vaping indoors and causing inconvenience to the staff. Jennie has personally apologized to all the staff on-site who may have been affected.\"\n\nThe situation has escalated to the point where South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed receiving a petition to investigate the incident. Some reports suggest that the video may have been filmed in Capri, Italy, prompting online users to call for diplomatic involvement in the matter.\n\nThis incident has reignited discussions about the strict behavioral standards imposed on K-pop idols. Jennie herself has previously spoken about these expectations in a Netflix documentary, stating, \"It's really harsh. We were not allowed to drink, smoke or get a tattoo.\"\n\nThe vaping controversy comes at a time when Jennie is pursuing solo endeavors alongside her commitments to BLACKPINK. In December 2023, she announced the establishment of her own company, OA, marking the beginning of her solo journey while maintaining her position within the group.\n\nBLACKPINK, consisting of Jennie, Jisoo, Ros\u00e9, and Lisa, recently renewed their contracts with YG Entertainment, ensuring the group's continuation. However, each member has also launched individual companies to explore personal projects.\n\nJennie's solo career has been gaining momentum, with releases like \"Solo\" in 2018 and more recent collaborations. She made her acting debut in 2023, appearing in HBO's The Idol alongside Lily-Rose Depp and The Weeknd.\n\nDuring a May interview with Vogue Korea, she revealed that she plans to release more music, telling the outlet, \"I'm spending almost all of my day working on music these days. I lost track of time. I'm working hard with a desire to share my music with more people and a bolder ambition, so please look forward to it. I'll come back with a great performance to meet that expectation.\"\n\nAs the situation unfolds, it is uncertain how or if this incident will impact Jennie's career and public image. OA Entertainment's apology concludes with a commitment to prevent similar occurrences in the future, stating, \"We hope to prevent this from reoccurring in the future.

Many netizens, especially from her home country of South Korea, slammed the idol for her irresponsible behavior. Since then, she has released an apology via her agency, ODD ATELIER.\n\nBut what's the big deal with a grown woman vaping? Well, the issue is a little deeper than that.\n\nOn July 2, 2024, Jennie uploaded a vlog to her YouTube channel, giving fans a glimpse into her three-day trip in Capri, Italy. Back in June, Jennie made her runway debut at Jacquemus' 15th anniversary show in the country.\n\nIt wasn't until July 8 that fans realized she had included a clip of her vaping in the vlog. A user on X (formerly Twitter) shared the clip to the platform, and it immediately went viral. In the clip, Jennie is seen holding onto a small, rectangular-shaped device. As she gets her hair and makeup done, she brings it to her lips and exhales smoke.\n\nInitially, fans theorized that it could be an aromatherapy diffuser that is used in a similar fashion to a vape. However, most people were convinced the device resembled a Juul.\n\nWhile most people had no problems with her vaping, it was where she did so that sparked backlash. Since January of this year, Italy has prohibited smoking and the use of vapes/e-cigarettes in enclosed places. It is also banned in places of collective use, in any form of transportation, in areas intended for the consumption of food and drink, and in rooms used for sporting, cultural, and recreational activities. With that, Jennie has actually broken the law.\n\nOn top of that, people claimed Jennie blew the smoke into the face of the stylist doing her makeup. The idol faced backlash for her lack of etiquette, with netizens stating she should have blown her smoke in a different direction or found a place without other people to vape in, and she was called out for smoking around so many staff members in general.\n\nAmid the growing backlash and hate against her, Jennie released an apology via her self-established agency, ODD ATELIER. The apology was shared on the company's official X account in both English and Korean.\n\nIn her statement, she acknowledged that she vaped indoors and apologized for her actions. Additionally, it was revealed that Jennie had personally apologized to all the staff on-site who may have been affected by her vaping. Through her company, Jennie stated that she would do her best to prevent an incident such as this from occurring again in the future.\n\nHowever, it appears Jennie may not be walking away without any consequences. According to a report from My Daily, Jennie has been reported to the Korean embassy in Italy for smoking indoors. An anonymous individual reportedly submitted evidence against the BLACKPINK star and asked for an investigation to be conducted.\n\nCurrently, it is unknown if Jennie will be fined or face any legal action for vaping.", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mary Sue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexandria_lopez@themarysue.com", "name": "Alexandria Lopez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlog", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vlog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpink", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blackpink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_idol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japanese idol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netizen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netizen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Capri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Etiquette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Korean language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/blackpink-jennie.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716980", "eventUri": "eng-9716980", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "textStart": 710, "textEnd": 716}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The video was initially a part of her Capri vlog, which she released from her personal YouTube channel, Jennierubyjane Official.\n\nAfter days of speculation and fans urging the Blackpink member to speak up, Jennie's agency, OddAtelier Entertainment, has responded. The new label's official statement contains Jennie's apology to fans.\n\nWas Blackpink member Jennie vaping indoors in Italy?\n\nSmoking or vaping is a taboo topic in the K-pop world, and fans often express concerns about stars who engage in it. However, in Blackpink Jennie's case, the clip showed that she was vaping indoors while getting her hair and makeup done for a brand shoot. It is to be noted that Italy prohibits smoking in most indoor places, including workplaces and enclosed public places.\n\nNetizens highlighted that the issue is not just Jennie vaping but also not respecting the general rules. Since the flak, Jennie's team edited the Italy vlog, and the vaping clip is no longer part of it.\n\nDays after the criticism, Jennie addressed the issue with a sincere apology. The \"Solo\" crooner's agency stated: \"We sincerely apologize to everyone who felt uncomfortable with Jennie's actions in the content released on the 2nd. Jennie acknowledges and deeply regrets her mistake of vaping indoors and causing inconvenience to the staff. Jennie has personally apologized to all the staff on-site who may have been affected. We apologize to her fans who have been disappointed through this incident. We hope to prevent this from reoccurring in the future.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Korean media reports stated that a netizen had urged the Korean Embassy to investigate Jennie's breaking the rules. Reports suggest that a netizen issued a formal complaint that stated, \"The Embassy of the Republic of Korea in Italy should request an investigation from the Italian authorities regarding BLACKPINK's Jennie's indoor smoking incident and take strict action.\"\n\nPreviously, K-drama actors Ji Chang-Wook and singer Do Kyung-soo also faced public scrutiny for smoking indoors. Both stars issued apologies for their actions.\n\nMeanwhile, Jennie has started chapter two of her solo era with incredible success. The star's latest collaboration track, \"Spot!\" with rapper Zico, had massive streams worldwide and ranked 8th on the Billboard Global US Excl.

The act raised eyebrows particularly in countries like South Korea and Italy, where smoking indoors and in certain outdoor areas is prohibited by law.In the brief footage, Jennie is seen bringing a device to her lips and exhaling smoke, prompting swift criticism from netizens.\n\nBeyond the act itself, the backlash intensified as viewers pointed out that Jennie appeared to be smoking in the presence of her staff, potentially exposing non-smokers to second-hand smoke. Criticism mounted further when Korean netizens noted she exhaled smoke near her makeup artist's face.\n\nThe contentious clip has since been removed from the vlog, but Jennie continues to face scrutiny and condemnation from both domestic and international audiences. However, amidst the uproar, some netizens have floated an alternate theory regarding the device in question. While many initially identified it as a vape or electronic cigarette, others speculate it could be a type of diffuser purported to offer health benefits and vitamins.\n\nDespite these speculations, identifying the exact nature of the device remains inconclusive due to the ambiguous nature of the footage. Some argue the device's square shape aligns more with a diffuser than a vape, yet questions persist over why such equipment would need editing from the vlog. As discussions unfold, opinions on Jennie's actions and the device she used continue to diverge.\n\nThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Blowing smoke in the face of the staff indoors - it's just rude,\" a top YouTube comment on a media outlet's channel reads. Another one says: \"Even smokers know that you don't puff on your friends' face. You only do it when you really don't care about the people around you.\" Smoking and vaping indoors is banned in South Korea and is punishable by a fine of up to \u20a9100,000 ($72; \u00a356).

In response to the backlash from netizens, Jennie's personal management agency, ODD ATELIER Entertainment, issued an official apology on Tuesday.\n\nIn a brief clip, Jennie was captured bringing a device to her lips and exhaling smoke.

You never know what's coming, when it's coming, or who it will involve. And it turns out, not even the biggest names in the industry are exempt from the scrutiny of South Korean outlets -- not even BLACKPINK's Jennie.\n\nOverall, the BLACKPINK girls have all faced their fair share of criticism. From appearing lazy on stage to facing drug allegations -- according to the media, they've done it all. It's no surprise that with great power comes even greater criticism, but sometimes things get so ridiculous that you can't help but roll your eyes. If you don't know what I'm talking about, allow me to explain the most recent controversy Jennie has found herself in.\n\nIn a now-deleted vlog on her channel, Jennie included a clip where she was seen vaping indoors near a staff member. While we'd love to say \"That's it, that's the controversy,\" we must admit that nothing is as simple as a quick dismissal. After the video went online, both BLINKS (the name for BLACKPINK's fandom) and haters alike took to Instagram to scrutinize the singer in the comment sections for not only smoking but smoking indoors so close to a staff member's face. \"I'm disappointed. I don't think you have an addiction, but you go to a lot of parties, you drink a lot, and now you smoke,\" one comment said.\n\nThe video gained so much traction that Jennie's new company, OA, felt the need to issue an apology on Jennie's behalf, confirming that she was indeed vaping indoors. In the apology letter, the company assured fans that Jennie personally apologized to the staff members affected and even apologized to fans who were disappointed in her. Truthfully, if this incident weren't a direct and tragic reflection of South Korea's priorities, it would almost be laughable.\n\nIt isn't the first time an idol has faced such criticism for being caught smoking or vaping. Just this past November, the leader of the K-pop group BTS was heavily criticized by the media for accidentally posting a picture of himself smoking a cigarette. This goes to show that, no, it's not just women in K-pop who are victims of these standards. What it is though, is blatant evidence that K-pop artists are not, and have never been, respected as real human adults who are more than capable of making their own decisions.\n\nGranted, one should always be respectful of those around them when doing something as unhealthy as smoking. However, some fans, in a tragic attempt to clear her name, have even gone as far as to claim that Jennie was not vaping but using a vitamin diffuser.\n\nObviously, the company's apology dispelled the diffuser claim right away, but it is still incredibly disrespectful how fans of K-pop artists create unrealistic and childish expectations for their idols to live up to. Who they date, what kind of bad habits they have, or even what they choose to wear is none of our concern -- but we get it; parasocial relationships are difficult to let go of.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "francisca_santos@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Francisca Santos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpink", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blackpink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-pop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "K-pop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_roulette", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian roulette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vlog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fandom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasocial_interaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parasocial interaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BTS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_idol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Korean idol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_idol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japanese idol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Jennie-Blackpink.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716980", "eventUri": "eng-9716980", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

She was caught smoking an e-cigarette while getting ready in Capri. The scene was accidentally featured in her vlog, sparking backlash from the public.\n\nSmoking indoors is considered illegal in many countries. Jennie also may be facing legal repercussions, given that someone has since reported her to the authorities in Italy.\n\nBLACKPINK's Jennie Facing Legal Punishment For Italy Scandal\n\nAccording to an article from Sports Chosun on July 11, 2024, a staff who had been on site smoke up about the matter. They stepped up anonymously, claiming that \"the place in the video was the waiting area for the Jacquemus show, and it was not a smoking-prohibited area indoors. After asking if she could smoke, she immediately opened the window next to her and smoked like that.\"\n\nThe staff also continued to explain that Jennie had taken a puff while the makeup artist had been looking for a lip product, chalking things up to bad timing. In the video, it had looked like Jennie had blown the smoke into the staff's face.\n\nWhile the staff was looking for the lip product, Jennie had taken a drag of a bubble pen that was sold at the convenience store. It just so happened that the timing of her blowing the smoke out matched. She kept apologizing even after the show ended, and the staff involved also said that it was fine because they were also smokers. Although it is a problem that the smoke brushed by the top of the staff's head, I think it's not right for her past actions to be mentioned together as part of an attitude controversy [with this issue.] As her IRL friend, I'm leaving a comment as I feel upset that she is being misunderstood like this.\n\n-- On site staff\n\nA bubble pen is a type of vape commonly sold at convenience stores. Although it seems like Jennie may have gotten permission to smoke from the brand officials on site, in Italy, it has been illegal to smoke indoors in public places from 2005.

After asking if she could smoke, she immediately opened the window next to her and smoked like that.\"\n\nThe staff further clarified that Jennie took a puff while the makeup artist was searching for a lip product, attributing it to unfortunate timing.\n\nThe video mistakenly appeared as if Jennie had blown smoke into the staff member's face.\n\n\"While the staff was looking for the lip product, Jennie had taken a drag of a bubble pen that was sold at the convenience store. It just so happened that the timing of her blowing the smoke out matched.\n\n\"She kept apologising even after the show ended, and the staff involved also said that it was fine because they were also smokers.\n\n\"Although it is a problem that the smoke brushed by the top of the staff's head, I think it's not right for her past actions to be mentioned together as part of an attitude controversy (with this issue).\n\n\"As her IRL (in real life) friend, I'm leaving a comment as I feel upset that she is being misunderstood like this,\" said the staff member.\n\nA bubble pen, a popular type of vape available at convenience stores, was reportedly used by Jennie.\n\nWhile it appears she may have obtained permission to smoke from brand officials in Italy, smoking indoors in public places has been illegal since 2005, with vapes being included in this regulation since 2014.", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malay Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "william_kc_kee@malaymail.com", "name": "William Kc Kee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpink", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blackpink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chosun_Ilbo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Chosun Ilbo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Capri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-pop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K-pop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Porte_Jacquemus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Simon Porte Jacquemus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make-up_artist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make-up artist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_(cooking)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smoking (cooking)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Singles_Chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irish Singles Chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.malaymail.com/malaymail/uploads/images/2024/07/11/thumbs/400x400/222906.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716980", "eventUri": "eng-9716980", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 14, "textEnd": 21, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

The footage, which quickly spread across various online platforms, was initially part of Jennie's YouTube vlog posted on July 2 but has since been removed. In the video, Jennie is seen receiving makeup and hair touch-ups from staff, during which she appears to take a puff from what appears to be an electronic cigarette and exhales smoke.\n\nThe act has drawn sharp criticism for its perceived disregard of those around her, particularly the staff attending to her grooming needs.According to South Korea's National Health Promotion Act, smoking indoors in designated non-smoking areas, such as large office buildings, can incur fines up to 100,000 won ($80). Netizens have voiced strong opinions, condemning Jennie's actions with comments questioning celebrities' understanding of smoking etiquette and suggesting greater restraint in such public situations.\n\nFollowing the uproar surrounding this incident, new developments have emerged as a concerned netizen, identified as 'A', took to an online community to voice grievances and call for action. According to reports from various media outlets, 'A' asserted that the controversial smoking scene involving Jennie likely occurred at a recent filming location on the Italian island of Capri. And in Capri, where she was, regulations strictly forbid smoking in enclosed spaces.\n\nIn the detailed post, 'A' disclosed that they had formally lodged a complaint via the National Petition Portal to the Korean Embassy in Italy, urging for an investigation into the matter. The netizen also provided evidence of their submission, including a screenshot indicating that the complaint had been forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nIn the complaint, 'A' passionately appealed, \"The Embassy of the Republic of Korea in Italy should request an investigation from the Italian authorities regarding BLACKPINK's Jennie's indoor smoking incident and take strict action\", as quoted by KTimes. The plea emphasized the importance of strict measures to address the situation, reflecting broader concerns about public figures' responsibilities and behaviors.\n\nThis incident draws parallels to past controversies involving celebrities such as actor Ji Chang-wook and singer Do Kyung-soo, who faced similar backlash and public scrutiny after being caught smoking indoors. Their actions had prompted apologies amid criticisms for disregarding smoking regulations and showing insensitivity towards those in their vicinity.\n\nThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

In a statement provided to Newsen, the agency acknowledged the issue and stated that they are currently investigating the facts surrounding the controversy. According to Koreaboo, \"Jennie is currently in the United States.We are in the process of verifying the facts about the controversy\", the statement from ODD ATELIER read.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the situation, the controversy erupted after fans discovered footage in one of Jennie's vlogs showing her allegedly smoking an electronic cigarette indoors. In the video, Jennie is seen holding a dark-colored device to her lips while receiving hair and makeup services, followed by exhaling smoke in the next frame.\n\nWhile Jennie is of legal age to smoke, the act of smoking indoors, whether using traditional cigarettes or electronic devices, is often prohibited in many countries, including South Korea and Italy where she was reportedly filming. Netizens and fans alike criticized Jennie for potentially disregarding indoor smoking laws and for exposing her staff to second-hand smoke.\n\nIndoor smoking regulations are taken seriously due to health concerns and legal restrictions aimed at protecting individuals from the effects of second-hand smoke. The incident has sparked a debate online about the responsibilities of public figures and the importance of adhering to local laws, regardless of one's status or location. As ODD ATELIER continues to investigate the matter, public scrutiny and discussion surrounding Jennie's actions are expected to persist.\n\nThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Stylists appear very close to her face as she breathes out. Though the footage was taken down from Kim's channel, a clip of her vaping spread across the internet.\n\nSome of the singer's fans quickly took to social media to criticize her, expressing their disappointment that she was vaping, especially in an enclosed room close to other people.\n\nOthers stuck by the celebrity and posted their support, noting that it is a personal choice whether or not to vape.\n\nOdd Atelier, a label founded by Kim in November last year, posted the star's apology to X, writing that \"Jennie acknowledges and deeply regrets her mistake of vaping indoors and causing inconvenience to the staff.\"\n\nShe personally apologized to the staff on-site, Odd Atelier continued, adding that \"we apologize to her fans who have been disappointed through this incident.

After asking if she could smoke, she immediately opened the window next to her and smoked like that\".\n\nThe staff member further explained that Jennie's action of using a bubble pen coincided with a makeup artist's search for a lip product, creating an unfortunate timing issue. \"While the staff was looking for the lip product, Jennie had taken a drag of a bubble pen that was sold at the convenience store.

Stylists appear very close to her face as she breathes out. Though the footage was taken down from Kim's channel, a clip of her vaping spread across the internet.\n\nSome of the singer's fans quickly took to social media to criticize her, expressing their disappointment that she was vaping, especially in an enclosed room close to other people.\n\nOthers stuck by the celebrity and posted their support, noting that it is a personal choice whether or not to vape.\n\nOdd Atelier, a label founded by Kim in November last year, posted the star's apology to X, writing that \"Jennie acknowledges and deeply regrets her mistake of vaping indoors and causing inconvenience to the staff.\"\n\nShe personally apologized to the staff on-site, Odd Atelier continued, adding that \"we apologize to her fans who have been disappointed through this incident. We hope to prevent this from reoccurring in the future.\"\n\nK-pop stars regularly face immense public scrutiny under the spotlight.\n\nIn March, singer Karina apologized to her fans after it was revealed that she was in a relationship with actor Lee Jae-wook.\n\nSome outraged fans sent a truck with an electronic billboard to the headquarters of Karina's agency, according to the Chosun Ilbo newspaper, which published a photo of the sign. \"Do you not get enough love from your fans?\" it read. \"Why did you choose to betray your fans?\"\n\nJust five weeks later, the couple split, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap, citing statements from the pair's respective representatives.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Permission to smoke was asked of everyone before vaping occurred with a window open.\"\n\nThe netizen continued, \"Jennie began smoking a bubble pen bought at a convenience store while her makeup staff was looking for a lip product. It just happened that the staff turned around at the wrong time. Jennie apologized to the staff member numerous times, including after the show wrapped up. The staff member said it was fine, since she is a smoker herself.\"\n\nThe netizens concluded, \"It is true that blowing smoke in the direction of the staff can be considered a problematic incident. However, I don't know that this incident alone should be cause to bring up the artist's past actions or accusations of poor character. As her friend, I'm upset that this is causing such a misunderstanding.\"\n\nDespite the alleged staff member's defense, many Korean netizens still showed disapproval toward Jennie's actions. In particular, many observed that the netizen's words had little credibility, and others also noted that smoking is banned in all indoor areas in Italy.\n\nSome left harsh comments like,\n\n\"Well what is a paid worker like her supposed to say when her job is on the line? Get angry? Of course she'll say it's fine when it's not.\"\n\n\"All her staff act like her servants. Do they have no sense of self-awareness?\"\n\n\"If you're not the person who got smoke blown into their face, your opinion doesn't matter.\"\n\n\"The only thing this netizen's defense did was give people reason to trash talk Jennie's personality another day.\"\n\n\"Who even believes this person is really one of the staff members? It could by anybody just impersonating the staff.\"\n\n\"No matter the time and place, blowing smoke into someone else's face is the lowest.\"\n\n\"The actual staff who got smoke blown on her face is keeping quiet lol. She knows how to keep her job.\"\n\n\"Indoor smoking shouldn't be an issue of permission or consent. It should be banned, period!\"\n\n\"If the staff go on treating the artists like their masters who can get away with anything, these kinds of unbalanced power relationships will never improve.\"\n\n\"The fact that there are servants willing to defend her is more proof that she holds immense power over their jobs.\"\n\n\"I've been smoking for 20 years but I have never seen anyone blow smoke in another smoker's face so casually. Apparently this person knows nothing about smoking manners.\"\n\nMeanwhile, immediately following the incident, Jennie's agency ODD ATELIER issued a statement apologizing for the idol's actions.\n\nSEE ALSO: BLACKPINK's 'BORN PINK' world tour concert movie release date and trailer revealed", "source": {"uri": "allkpop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "allkpop"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_idol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Korean idol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netizen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netizen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Porte_Jacquemus", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Simon Porte Jacquemus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fashion show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpink", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blackpink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_South_Korea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time in South Korea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Korean language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_Pink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Born Pink"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Smoked", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Smoked", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Smoking_Cessation", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Smoking Cessation", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 26}], "image": "https://www.allkpop.com/upload/2024/07/content/102357/web_data/allkpop_1720670597_20240710-jennie.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716980", "eventUri": "eng-9716980", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 226, "textEnd": 233}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

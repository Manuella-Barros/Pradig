So, I mean you just kind of got to rock with the punches and just be able to go play.\"\n\nThe NFL has desired adding more games for years, along with the increase in lucrative national television windows. The league increased the regular season from 14 games to 16 in 1978 and kept it there for decades.\n\nBut Goodell and the owners pushed through a 17th game in the latest CBA negotiations leading into the 2021 season and aren't content stopping there, with Goodell saying in the spring that going to 18 games remains a priority as long as it can be done without significantly impacting player safety.\n\n\"If you'd asked me that 10 years ago, I probably would be excited about it.

It also could push the Super Bowl to Presidents Day weekend with a federal holiday the day after the game. That would either require not adding a second bye week -- which most players said would be needed to play an extra game -- or moving the start of the season to Labor Day weekend, which the NFL has avoided since the 2000 season.\n\nWhile moving the Super Bowl to a long holiday weekend might have appeal to many fans who wouldn't have to go to work the next day, it could turn an NFL season into a seven-month marathon from the start of training camp to the final game.\n\n\"I feel like a couple people are going to feel like (Nikola) Jokic, ready to go home,\" Raiders cornerback Nate Hobbs said, referring to the NBA star who complained about the length of that season when his Denver Nuggets won the championship in 2023. \"But it takes what it takes, like the real champions are going to emerge and the real mentally strong survive. ... So, it really doesn't matter. Presidents Day and February all run into each other to me. It's all the same, I'm here now so it is what it is.

Of the 100 most-watched TV broadcasts in 2023, 93 were NFL games, up from 61 in 2018.\n\nBut that extra revenue comes at a price borne by the bodies of the players.\n\n\"The fans, and rightfully so, shouldn't know all the injuries we go through, but they don't know what it takes to play on Sundays,\" said Colts center Ryan Kelly, the team's player representative. \"I think it's just too many games.\"\n\nWhen the NFL added a 17th game in 2021, the league took away one preseason game. Goodell had said that would be the plan again if the league ever went to an 18-game season.\n\nBut that raises concern from coaches about having fewer chances for younger players to prove themselves or develop and does little to ease the concerns of veterans, many of whom play few or no snaps in exhibition games.\n\n\"They talk about taking a preseason game out, which to me doesn't really matter because I play in like one preseason game,\" said 49ers All-Pro tight end George Kittle, who has played 37 snaps in the preseason in the past six years. \"Most vets do. So that really doesn't do anything for anybody.\"\n\nOther concessions would be much more important to players, whether it would be the extra bye week, a change to the offseason schedule or perhaps, most importantly, a larger share of the revenue. Players had their portion of shareable revenues rise from 47% to 48.5% under the last CBA when the season was increased to 17 games.\n\nAn 18th game would increase the size of the revenue pie and perhaps even the share that goes to players. When the season expanded to 17 games in 2021, some players were able to get an extra game check to increase their salary.\n\nESPN surveyed players in the offseason and found 46% were in favor of expanding the season to 18 games with stipulations, and another 8% willing to do it without any concessions.\n\n\"That's another check, right?\" 49ers defensive end Leonard Floyd said when asked for

(AP) -- The debate about whether the NFL will expand the regular season once again seems to have been resolved and now it's a matter of how soon the league adds an 18th game.\n\nCommissioner Roger Goodell has talked openly about it, union chief Lloyd Howell recently told the Washington Post that the NFLPA is open to doing it before the current collective bargaining agreement expires after the 2030 season and players seem resigned to the inevitability no matter how they might personally feel.\n\n\"I mean, I feel like we really ain't got no choice, to be honest,\" said Seattle Seahawks veteran receiver Tyler Lockett, who said he'd prefer adding another bye week instead of another game to give TV networks more broadcast windows without taxing the players with another game.\n\n\"I think that's more fair, but we know it's probably not going to end up like that. So, I mean you just kind of got to rock with the punches and just be able to go play.\"\n\nThe NFL has desired adding more games for years, along with the increase in lucrative national television windows. The league increased the regular season from 14 games to 16 in 1978 and kept it there for decades.\n\nBut Goodell and the owners pushed through a 17th game in the latest CBA negotiations leading into the 2021 season and aren't content stopping there, with Goodell saying in the spring that going to 18 games remains a priority as long as it can be done without significantly impacting player safety.\n\n\"If you'd asked me that 10 years ago, I probably would be excited about it. Now, not so excited, but it is what it is,\" Raiders receiver Davante Adams said. \"That's the thing that's special about football and why I really wanted to play football over basketball, is that I just feel like it's a different type of feeling knowing that you only have a limited amount of opportunities out there.\"\n\nAdding another game to the season would add more broadcast windows. It also could push the Super Bowl to Presidents Day weekend with a federal holiday the day after the game. That would either require not adding a second bye week -- which most players said would be needed to play an extra game -- or moving the start of the season to Labor Day weekend, which the NFL has avoided since the 2000 season.\n\nWhile moving the Super Bowl to a long holiday weekend might have appeal to many fans who wouldn't have to go to work the next day, it could turn an NFL season into a seven-month marathon from the start of training camp to the final game.\n\n\"I feel like a couple people are going to feel like (Nikola) Jokic, ready to go home,\" Raiders cornerback Nate Hobbs said, referring to the NBA star who complained about the length of that season when his Denver Nuggets won the championship in 2023. \"But it takes what it takes, like the real champions are going to emerge and the real mentally strong survive. ... So, it really doesn't matter. Presidents Day and February all run into each other to me. It's all the same, I'm here now so it is what it is. I know it's for entertainment.\"\n\nThe NFL is getting paid more than $113 billion over 11 years for its broadcast rights as the most valuable television property. Of the 100 most-watched TV broadcasts in 2023, 93 were NFL games, up from 61 in 2018.\n\nBut that extra revenue comes at a price borne by the bodies of the players.\n\n\"The fans, and rightfully so, shouldn't know all the injuries we go through, but they don't know what it takes to play on Sundays,\" said Colts center Ryan Kelly, the team's player representative. \"I think it's just too many games.\"\n\nWhen the NFL added a 17th game in 2021, the league took away one preseason game. Goodell had said that would be the plan again if the league ever went to an 18-game season.\n\nBut that raises concern from coaches about having fewer chances for younger players to prove themselves or develop and does little to ease the concerns of veterans, many of whom play few or no snaps in exhibition games.\n\n\"They talk about taking a preseason game out, which to me doesn't really matter because I play in like one preseason game,\" said 49ers All-Pro tight end George Kittle, who has played 37 snaps in the preseason in the past six years. \"Most vets do. So that really doesn't do anything for anybody.\"\n\nOther concessions would be much more important to players, whether it would be the extra bye week, a change to the offseason schedule or perhaps, most importantly, a larger share of the revenue. Players had their portion of shareable revenues rise from 47% to 48.5% under the last CBA when the season was increased to 17 games.\n\nAn 18th game would increase the size of the revenue pie and perhaps even the share that goes to players. When the season expanded to 17 games in 2021, some players were able to get an extra game check to increase their salary.\n\nESPN surveyed players in the offseason and found 46% were in favor of expanding the season to 18 games with stipulations, and another 8% willing to do it without any concessions.\n\n\"That's another check, right?\" 49ers defensive end Leonard Floyd said when asked for his opinion about an 18th game. \"More games, more checks.\"\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Rob Maaddi, Teresa Walker, Dennis Waszak Jr., and AP Sports Writers Mark Anderson, Tim Booth, David Brandt, Larry Lage, Steve Reed, Andy Seligman, Mitch Stacy contributed.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- The debate about whether the NFL will expand the regular season once again seems to have been resolved and now it's a matter of how soon the league adds an 18th game.\n\nCommissioner Roger Goodell has talked openly about it, union chief Lloyd Howell recently told the Washington Post that the NFLPA is open to doing it before the current collective bargaining agreement expires after the 2030 season and players seem resigned to the inevitability no matter how they might personally feel.\n\n\"I mean, I feel like we really ain't got no choice, to be honest,\" said Seattle Seahawks veteran receiver Tyler Lockett, who said he'd prefer adding another bye week instead of another game to give TV networks more broadcast windows without taxing the players with another game.\n\n\"I think that's more fair, but we know it's probably not going to end up like that. So, I mean you just kind of got to rock with the punches and just be able to go play.\"\n\nThe NFL has desired adding more games for years, along with the increase in lucrative national television windows. The league increased the regular season from 14 games to 16 in 1978 and kept it there for decades.\n\nBut Goodell and the owners pushed through a 17th game in the latest CBA negotiations leading into the 2021 season and aren't content stopping there, with Goodell saying in the spring that going to 18 games remains a priority as long as it can be done without significantly impacting player safety.\n\n\"If you'd asked me that 10 years ago, I probably would be excited about it. Now, not so excited, but it is what it is,\" Raiders receiver Davante Adams said. \"That's the thing that's special about football and why I really wanted to play football over basketball, is that I just feel like it's a different type of feeling knowing that you only have a limited amount of opportunities out there.\"\n\nAdding another game to the season would add more broadcast windows. It also could push the Super Bowl to Presidents Day weekend with a federal holiday the day after the game. That would either require not adding a second bye week -- which most players said would be needed to play an extra game -- or moving the start of the season to Labor Day weekend, which the NFL has avoided since the 2000 season.\n\nWhile moving the Super Bowl to a long holiday weekend might have appeal to many fans who wouldn't have to go to work the next day, it could turn an NFL season into a seven-month marathon from the start of training camp to the final game.\n\n\"I feel like a couple people are going to feel like (Nikola) Jokic, ready to go home,\" Raiders cornerback Nate Hobbs said, referring to the NBA star who complained about the length of that season when his Denver Nuggets won the championship in 2023. \"But it takes what it takes, like the real champions are going to emerge and the real mentally strong survive. ... So, it really doesn't matter. Presidents Day and February all run into each other to me. It's all the same, I'm here now so it is what it is. I know it's for entertainment.\"\n\nThe NFL is getting paid more than $113 billion over 11 years for its broadcast rights as the most valuable television property. Of the 100 most-watched TV broadcasts in 2023, 93 were NFL games, up from 61 in 2018.\n\nBut that extra revenue comes at a price borne by the bodies of the players.\n\n\"The fans, and rightfully so, shouldn't know all the injuries we go through, but they don't know what it takes to play on Sundays,\" said Colts center Ryan Kelly, the team's player representative. \"I think it's just too many games.\"\n\nWhen the NFL added a 17th game in 2021, the league took away one preseason game. Goodell had said that would be the plan again if the league ever went to an 18-game season.\n\nBut that raises concern from coaches about having fewer chances for younger players to prove themselves or develop and does little to ease the concerns of veterans, many of whom play few or no snaps in exhibition games.\n\n\"They talk about taking a preseason game out, which to me doesn't really matter because I play in like one preseason game,\" said 49ers All-Pro tight end George Kittle, who has played 37 snaps in the preseason in the past six years. \"Most vets do. So that really doesn't do anything for anybody.\"\n\nOther concessions would be much more important to players, whether it would be the extra bye week, a change to the offseason schedule or perhaps, most importantly, a larger share of the revenue. Players had their portion of shareable revenues rise from 47% to 48.5% under the last CBA when the season was increased to 17 games.\n\nAn 18th game would increase the size of the revenue pie and perhaps even the share that goes to players. When the season expanded to 17 games in 2021, some players were able to get an extra game check to increase their salary.\n\nESPN surveyed players in the offseason and found 46% were in favor of expanding the season to 18 games with stipulations, and another 8% willing to do it without any concessions.\n\n\"That's another check, right?\" 49ers defensive end Leonard Floyd said when asked for his opinion about an 18th game. \"More games, more checks.\"\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Rob Maaddi, Teresa Walker, Dennis Waszak Jr., and AP Sports Writers Mark Anderson, Tim Booth, David Brandt,

The league increased the regular season from 14 games to 16 in 1978 and kept it there for decades.\n\nHowever, Goodell and team owners pushed through a 17th game in the latest CBA negotiations leading into the 2021 season and aren't content stopping there, with the commissioner saying in the spring that going to 18 games remains a priority as long as it can be done without significantly impacting player safety.\n\n\"If you'd asked me that 10 years ago, I probably would be excited about it. Now, not so excited, but it is what it is,\" Las Vegas Raiders receiver Davante Adams said. \"That's the thing that's special about football and why I really wanted to play football over basketball, is that I just feel like it's a different type of feeling knowing that you only have a limited amount of opportunities out there.\"\n\nAP photo by Stephen Brashear / Seattle Seahawks receiver Tyler Lockett signs autographs for fans after a July 27 practice in Renton, Wash.\n\nAdding another game to the season would add more broadcast windows. It also could push the Super Bowl to Presidents Day weekend with a federal holiday the day after the game. That would either require not adding a second open date -- which most players said would be needed to play an extra game -- or moving the start of the season to Labor Day weekend, which the NFL has avoided since the 2000 season.\n\nWhile moving the Super Bowl to a long holiday weekend might have appeal to many fans who wouldn't have to go to work the next day, it could turn an NFL season into a seven-month marathon from the start of training camp to the final game.\n\n\"I feel like a couple people are going to feel like (Nikola) Jokic, ready to go home,\" Raiders cornerback Nate Hobbs said, referring to the NBA star who complained about the length of that season when his Denver Nuggets won the championship in 2023. \"But it takes what it takes, like the real champions are going to emerge and the real mentally strong survive. ... So, it really doesn't matter. Presidents Day and February all run into each other to me. It's all the same, I'm here now, so it is what it is. I know it's for entertainment.\"\n\nThe NFL is getting paid more than $113 billion over 11 years for its broadcast rights as the most valuable television property. Of the 100 most-watched TV broadcasts last year, 93 were NFL games, up from 61 in 2018.\n\nThat extra revenue, though, comes at a price borne by the bodies of the players.\n\n\"The fans, and rightfully so, shouldn't know all the injuries we go through, but they don't know what it takes to play on Sundays,\" said Indianapolis Colts center Ryan Kelly, the team's player representative for the union. \"I think it's just too many games.\"\n\nWhen the NFL added a 17th game in 2021, the league took away one preseason game. Goodell had said that would be the plan again if the league ever went to an 18-game regular season.\n\nStill, that raises concern from coaches about having fewer chances for younger players to prove themselves or develop and does little to ease the concerns of veterans, with many playing little or not at all in exhibition games.\n\n\"They talk about taking a preseason game out, which to me doesn't really matter because I play in like one preseason game,\" said San Francisco 49ers All-Pro tight end George Kittle, who has been on the field for 37 snaps in the preseason in the past six years. \"Most vets do.

The league increased the regular season from 14 games to 16 in 1978 and kept it there for decades.\n\nBut Goodell and the owners pushed through a 17th game in the latest CBA negotiations leading into the 2021 season and aren't content stopping there, with Goodell saying in the spring that going to 18 games remains a priority as long as it can be done without significantly impacting player safety.\n\n\"If you'd asked me that 10 years ago, I probably would be excited about it. Now, not so excited, but it is what it is,\" Raiders receiver Davante Adams said. \"That's the thing that's special about football and why I really wanted to play football over basketball, is that I just feel like it's a different type of feeling knowing that you only have a limited amount of opportunities out there.\"\n\nAdding another game to the season would add more broadcast windows. It also could push the Super Bowl to Presidents Day weekend with a federal holiday the day after the game. That would either require not adding a second bye week -- which most players said would be needed to play an extra game -- or moving the start of the season to Labor Day weekend, which the NFL has avoided since the 2000 season.\n\nWhile moving the Super Bowl to a long holiday weekend might have appeal to many fans who wouldn't have to go to work the next day, it could turn an NFL season into a seven-month marathon from the start of training camp to the final game.\n\n\"I feel like a couple people are going to feel like (Nikola) Jokic, ready to go home,\" Raiders cornerback Nate Hobbs said, referring to the NBA star who complained about the length of that season when his Denver Nuggets won the championship in 2023. \"But it takes what it takes, like the real champions are going to emerge and the real mentally strong survive. ...

Goodell had said that would be the plan again if the league ever went to an 18-game season.\n\nBut that raises concern from coaches about having fewer chances for younger players to prove themselves or develop and does little to ease the concerns of veterans, many of whom play few or no snaps in exhibition games.\n\n\"They talk about taking a preseason game out, which to me doesn't really matter because I play in like one preseason game,\" said 49ers All-Pro tight end George Kittle, who has played 37 snaps in the preseason in the past six years. \"Most vets do.

(AP) -- The debate about whether the NFL will expand the regular season once again seems to have been resolved and now it's a matter of how soon the league adds an 18th game.\n\nCommissioner Roger Goodell has talked openly about it, union chief Lloyd Howell recently told the Washington Post that the NFLPA is open to doing it before the current collective bargaining agreement expires after the 2030 season and players seem resigned to the inevitability no matter how they might personally feel.\n\n\"I mean, I feel like we really ain't got no choice, to be honest,\" said Seattle Seahawks veteran receiver Tyler Lockett, who said he'd prefer adding another bye week instead of another game to give TV networks more broadcast windows without taxing the players with another game.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nWoman arrested after sharing 'all you can eat' order at Portage Applebee's Man identified in fatal motorcycle crash, Lake County coroner says Court ruling strikes down Indiana residential property tax policy NWI Business Ins and Outs: Cooper's Hawk, Lala's Ice Cream and Paleta Shop, and Levin Tire Center opening; Pet Haven and Hardee's closing UPDATE: Search underway for missing 17-year-old male caught in Lake Michigan waves Tuesday afternoon Davich: Behold, the finest lakefront beach and park in Northwest Indiana Portillo's set to open Orland Park drive-thru by 2025 5-year-old dies after being found in pool, Griffith police say The Original Rainbow Cone to open ice cream parlor in Dyer this month Michigan City gearing up for lakefront power boat race Valparaiso University to eliminate 30 academic programs Parents who no longer wanted adopted child charged with neglect, records show UPDATE: No injuries reported in rollover crash on I-94, ISP says Mind on Money: For the economy, time will tell U.S. Steel profit plunges 62% year-over-year in the second quarter\n\n\"I think that's more fair, but we know it's probably not going to end up like that. So, I mean you just kind of got to rock with the punches and just be able to go play.\"\n\nThe NFL has desired adding more games for years, along with the increase in lucrative national television windows. The league increased the regular season from 14 games to 16 in 1978 and kept it there for decades.\n\nBut Goodell and the owners pushed through a 17th game in the latest CBA negotiations leading into the 2021 season and aren't content stopping there, with Goodell saying in the spring that going to 18 games remains a priority as long as it can be done without significantly impacting player safety.\n\n\"If you'd asked me that 10 years ago, I probably would be excited about it. Now, not so excited, but it is what it is,\" Raiders receiver Davante Adams said. \"That's the thing that's special about football and why I really wanted to play football over basketball, is that I just feel like it's a different type of feeling knowing that you only have a limited amount of opportunities out there.\"\n\nAdding another game to the season would add more broadcast windows. It also could push the Super Bowl to Presidents Day weekend with a federal holiday the day after the game. That would either require not adding a second bye week -- which most players said would be needed to play an extra game -- or moving the start of the season to Labor Day weekend, which the NFL has avoided since the 2000 season.\n\nWhile moving the Super Bowl to a long holiday weekend might have appeal to many fans who wouldn't have to go to work the next day, it could turn an NFL season into a seven-month marathon from the start of training camp to the final game.\n\n\"I feel like a couple people are going to feel like (Nikola) Jokic, ready to go home,\" Raiders cornerback Nate Hobbs said, referring to the NBA star who complained about the length of that season when his Denver Nuggets won the championship in 2023. \"But it takes what it takes, like the real champions are going to emerge and the real mentally strong survive. ... So, it really doesn't matter. Presidents Day and February all run into each other to me. It's all the same, I'm here now so it is what it is. I know it's for entertainment.\"\n\nThe NFL is getting paid more than $113 billion over 11 years for its broadcast rights as the most valuable television property. Of the 100 most-watched TV broadcasts in 2023, 93 were NFL games, up from 61 in 2018.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBut that extra revenue comes at a price borne by the bodies of the players.\n\n\"The fans, and rightfully so, shouldn't know all the injuries we go through, but they don't know what it takes to play on Sundays,\" said Colts center Ryan Kelly, the team's player representative. \"I think it's just too many games.\"\n\nWhen the NFL added a 17th game in 2021, the league took away one preseason game. Goodell had said that would be the plan again if the league ever went to an 18-game season.\n\nBut that raises concern from coaches about having fewer chances for younger players to prove themselves or develop and does little to ease the concerns of veterans, many of whom play few or no snaps in exhibition games.\n\n\"They talk about taking a preseason game out, which to me doesn't really matter because I play in like one preseason game,\" said 49ers All-Pro tight end George Kittle, who has played 37 snaps in the preseason in the past six years. \"Most vets do. So that really doesn't do anything for anybody.\"\n\nOther concessions would be much more important to players, whether it would be the extra bye week, a change to the offseason schedule or perhaps, most importantly, a larger share of the revenue. Players had their portion of shareable revenues rise from 47% to 48.5% under the last CBA when the season was increased to 17 games.\n\nAn 18th game would increase the size of the revenue pie and perhaps even the share that goes to players. When the season expanded to 17 games in 2021, some players were able to get an extra game check to increase their salary.\n\nESPN surveyed players in the offseason and found 46% were in favor of expanding the season to 18 games with stipulations, and another 8% willing to do it without any concessions.\n\n\"That's another check, right?\" 49ers defensive end Leonard Floyd said when asked for his opinion about an 18th game. \"More games, more checks.\"\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Rob Maaddi, Teresa Walker, Dennis Waszak Jr., and AP Sports Writers Mark Anderson, Tim Booth, David Brandt, Larry Lage, Steve Reed, Andy Seligman, Mitch Stacy contributed.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

That would either require not adding a second bye week -- which most players said would be needed to play an extra game -- or moving the start of the season to Labor Day weekend, which the NFL has avoided since the 2000 season.\n\nWhile moving the Super Bowl to a long holiday weekend might have appeal to many fans who wouldn't have to go to work the next day, it could turn an NFL season into a seven-month marathon from the start of training camp to the final game.\n\n\"I feel like a couple people are going to feel like (Nikola) Jokic, ready to go home,\" Raiders cornerback Nate Hobbs said, referring to the NBA star who complained about the length of that season when his Denver Nuggets won the championship in 2023. \"But it takes what it takes, like the real champions are going to emerge and the real mentally strong survive. ...

Goodell had said that would be the plan again if the league ever went to an 18-game season.\n\nBut that raises concern from coaches about having fewer chances for younger players to prove themselves or develop and does little to ease the concerns of veterans, many of whom play few or no snaps in exhibition games.\n\n\"They talk about taking a preseason game out, which to me doesn't really matter because I play in like one preseason game,\" said 49ers All-Pro tight end George Kittle, who has played 37 snaps in the preseason in the past six years. \"Most vets do.

(AP) -- The debate about whether the NFL will expand the regular season once again seems to have been resolved and now it's a matter of how soon the league adds an 18th game.\n\nCommissioner Roger Goodell has talked openly about it, union chief Lloyd Howell recently told the Washington Post that the NFLPA is open to doing it before the current collective bargaining agreement expires after the 2030 season and players seem resigned to the inevitability no matter how they might personally feel.\n\n\"I mean, I feel like we really ain't got no choice, to be honest,\" said Seattle Seahawks veteran receiver Tyler Lockett, who said he'd prefer adding another bye week instead of another game to give TV networks more broadcast windows without taxing the players with another game.\n\nPeople are also reading...

So, I mean you just kind of got to rock with the punches and just be able to go play.\"\n\nThe NFL has desired adding more games for years, along with the increase in lucrative national television windows. The league increased the regular season from 14 games to 16 in 1978 and kept it there for decades.\n\nBut Goodell and the owners pushed through a 17th game in the latest CBA negotiations leading into the 2021 season and aren't content stopping there, with Goodell saying in the spring that going to 18 games remains a priority as long as it can be done without significantly impacting player safety.\n\n\"If you'd asked me that 10 years ago, I probably would be excited about it. Now, not so excited, but it is what it is,\" Raiders receiver Davante Adams said. \"That's the thing that's special about football and why I really wanted to play football over basketball, is that I just feel like it's a different type of feeling knowing that you only have a limited amount of opportunities out there.\"\n\nAdding another game to the season would add more broadcast windows. It also could push the Super Bowl to Presidents Day weekend with a federal holiday the day after the game.

So, I mean you just kind of got to rock with the punches and just be able to go play.\"\n\nThe NFL has desired adding more games for years, along with the increase in lucrative national television windows. The league increased the regular season from 14 games to 16 in 1978 and kept it there for decades.\n\nBut Goodell and the owners pushed through a 17th game in the latest CBA negotiations leading into the 2021 season and aren't content stopping there, with Goodell saying in the spring that going to 18 games remains a priority as long as it can be done without significantly impacting player safety.\n\n\"If you'd asked me that 10 years ago, I probably would be excited about it. Now, not so excited, but it is what it is,\" Raiders receiver Davante Adams said. \"That's the thing that's special about football and why I really wanted to play football over basketball, is that I just feel like it's a different type of feeling knowing that you only have a limited amount of opportunities out there.\"\n\nAdding another game to the season would add more broadcast windows. It also could push the Super Bowl to Presidents Day weekend with a federal holiday the day after the game. That would either require not adding a second bye week -- which most players said would be needed to play an extra game -- or moving the start of the season to Labor Day weekend, which the NFL has avoided since the 2000 season.\n\nWhile moving the Super Bowl to a long holiday weekend might have appeal to many fans who wouldn't have to go to work the next day, it could turn an NFL season into a seven-month marathon from the start of training camp to the final game.\n\n\"I feel like a couple people are going to feel like (Nikola) Jokic, ready to go home,\" Raiders cornerback Nate Hobbs said, referring to the NBA star who complained about the length of that season when his Denver Nuggets won the championship in 2023. \"But it takes what it takes, like the real champions are going to emerge and the real mentally strong survive. ... So, it really doesn't matter. Presidents Day and February all run into each other to me. It's all the same, I'm here now so it is what it is. I know it's for entertainment.\"\n\nThe NFL is getting paid more than $113 billion over 11 years for its broadcast rights as the most valuable television property.

Goodell had said that would be the plan again if the league ever went to an 18-game season.\n\nBut that raises concern from coaches about having fewer chances for younger players to prove themselves or develop and does little to ease the concerns of veterans, many of whom play few or no snaps in exhibition games.\n\n\"They talk about taking a preseason game out, which to me doesn't really matter because I play in like one preseason game,\" said 49ers All-Pro tight end George Kittle, who has played 37 snaps in the preseason in the past six years. \"Most vets do. So that really doesn't do anything for anybody.\"\n\nOther concessions would be much more important to players, whether it would be the extra bye week, a change to the offseason schedule or perhaps, most importantly, a larger share of the revenue. Players had their portion of shareable revenues rise from 47% to 48.5% under the last CBA when the season was increased to 17 games.\n\nAn 18th game would increase the size of the revenue pie and perhaps even the share that goes to players. When the season expanded to 17 games in 2021, some players were able to get an extra game check to increase their salary.\n\nESPN surveyed players in the offseason and found 46% were in favor of expanding the season to 18 games with stipulations, and another 8% willing to do it without any concessions.\n\n\"That's another check, right?\" 49ers defensive end Leonard Floyd said when asked for his opinion about an 18th game. \"More games, more checks.\"\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Rob Maaddi, Teresa Walker, Dennis Waszak Jr., and AP Sports Writers Mark Anderson, Tim Booth, David Brandt, Larry Lage, Steve Reed, Andy Seligman, Mitch Stacy contributed.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The league increased the regular season from 14 games to 16 in 1978 and kept it there for decades.\n\nBut Goodell and the owners pushed through a 17th game in the latest CBA negotiations leading into the 2021 season and aren't content stopping there, with Goodell saying in the spring that going to 18 games remains a priority as long as it can be done without significantly impacting player safety.\n\n\"If you'd asked me that 10 years ago, I probably would be excited about it. Now, not so excited, but it is what it is,\" Raiders receiver Davante Adams said. \"That's the thing that's special about football and why I really wanted to play football over basketball, is that I just feel like it's a different type of feeling knowing that you only have a limited amount of opportunities out there.\"\n\nAdding another game to the season would add more broadcast windows. It also could push the Super Bowl to Presidents Day weekend with a federal holiday the day after the game. That would either require not adding a second bye week -- which most players said would be needed to play an extra game -- or moving the start of the season to Labor Day weekend, which the NFL has avoided since the 2000 season.\n\nWhile moving the Super Bowl to a long holiday weekend might have appeal to many fans who wouldn't have to go to work the next day, it could turn an NFL season into a seven-month marathon from the start of training camp to the final game.\n\n\"I feel like a couple people are going to feel like (Nikola) Jokic, ready to go home,\" Raiders cornerback Nate Hobbs said, referring to the NBA star who complained about the length of that season when his Denver Nuggets won the championship in 2023. \"But it takes what it takes, like the real champions are going to emerge and the real mentally strong survive. ... So, it really doesn't matter. Presidents Day and February all run into each other to me. It's all the same, I'm here now so it is what it is. I know it's for entertainment.\"\n\nThe NFL is getting paid more than $113 billion over 11 years for its broadcast rights as the most valuable television property. Of the 100 most-watched TV broadcasts in 2023, 93 were NFL games, up from 61 in 2018.\n\nBut that extra revenue comes at a price borne by the bodies of the players.\n\n\"The fans, and rightfully so, shouldn't know all the injuries we go through, but they don't know what it takes to play on Sundays,\" said Colts center Ryan Kelly, the team's player representative. \"I think it's just too many games.\"\n\nWhen the NFL added a 17th game in 2021, the league took away one preseason game. Goodell had said that would be the plan again if the league ever went to an 18-game season.\n\nBut that raises concern from coaches about having fewer chances for younger players to prove themselves or develop and does little to ease the concerns of veterans, many of whom play few or no snaps in exhibition games.\n\n\"They talk about taking a preseason game out, which to me doesn't really matter because I play in like one preseason game,\" said 49ers All-Pro tight end George Kittle, who has played 37 snaps in the preseason in the past six years. \"Most vets do. So that really doesn't do anything for anybody.\"\n\nOther concessions would be much more important to players, whether it would be the extra bye week, a change to the offseason schedule or perhaps, most importantly, a larger share of the revenue. Players had their portion of shareable revenues rise from 47% to 48.5% under the last CBA when the season was increased to 17 games.\n\nAn 18th game would increase the size of the revenue pie and perhaps even the share that goes to players. When the season expanded to 17 games in 2021, some players were able to get an extra game check to increase their salary.\n\nESPN surveyed players in the offseason and found 46% were in favor of expanding the season to 18 games with stipulations, and another 8% willing to do it without any concessions.\n\n\"That's another check, right?\" 49ers defensive end Leonard Floyd said when asked for his opinion about an 18th game. \"More games, more checks.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this

Trevor Lawrence opines", "body": "The NFL shifted to three preseason games from four after adding an extra regular-season game beginning with the 2021 season. Now, the NFL could look to shrink the preseason field further, adding another regular-season contest that could come with another game being removed from the preseason slate.\n\nIn late July, Washington Post NFL reporter Mark Maske reported that the NFL Players Association and the NFL have engaged in high-level discussions with the NFL about adding another game to the regular-season schedule, moving to 18 total for the season, according to union executive director Lloyd Howell.\n\nAlmost that time: Jacksonville Jaguars to play Trevor Lawrence, starters in preseason Week 1 vs. Chiefs\n\n\"Where does the 18th game come from? I think the foregone conclusion is, well, you just grab it, like, in what would otherwise be [preseason games] in August. You play it forward,\" Howell said via the Washington Post. \"But these are details that really need to be fleshed out. But, again, there are other economic, health and safety matters that also need to be clear to our members before there's ever an agreement about an 18th game.\"\n\nIf the talks progress and support comes from the NFL and NFLPA, it could be implemented before the NFL-NFLPA Collective Bargaining Agreement expires after the 2030 season. The current agreement prohibits the NFL and its owners from extending the regular season to 18 games unilaterally.\n\nPlayers around the league have already murmured about the prospect of adding another game, with many opposed to the potential move. Others, like Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow, have come up with ideas as to how it could be possible to implement this while taking player safety under heavy consideration.\n\nThose opposed cite player safety, while those for it may enjoy the extra game check and potential extra revenue sharing players get from expanding the season.\n\nHow does Trevor Lawrence feel about a potential 18-game regular season?\n\nThough he, admittedly, hasn't put much thought into it and the NFL-NFLPA haven't officially moved forward to make changes, Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence opined on the potential of an 18-game schedule at the start of training camp.\n\n\"It's a lot of games, so I think there has to be some give. That's a lot of games on the players, and it's already -- 17's a lot, when we went from 16 to 17. Maybe if there are two bye weeks. I don't really know what the conversations are there,\" Lawrence said.\n\n\"I haven't been involved with those, so I don't know. I don't have an answer for it, but I think you have to add some type of extra break if you're going to add an extra game, because that's a lot. You're not even talking about playoffs and preseason on top of that. How that all adjusts, I don't know, but I think if you do that you've got to give something up to give the guys a little bit of a break for their bodies.\"\n\nLawrence knows all too well how a long NFL season can impact a player's body. Last year, he suffered numerous injuries including a knee sprain, high-ankle sprain, concussion and a shoulder injury.\n\nNFL players fought back against the league expanding to 17 games due to concerns over player health and longevity with a few more outspoken than others. In Lawrence's on-the-spot idea, the league could give players an added week break to offset the added car-crash moments players have on a weekly basis during the year.\n\nAs Lawrence pointed out, expanding to 18 games is really 22 games from 21 if you include the Wild Card and Divisional-round games, the Championship games and the Super Bowl. The guarantees players may need to approve further expansion could go beyond a break, though.\n\nSome players, such as Indianapolis Colts center Ryan Kelly, have suggested a different revenue split as a potential line in the stand players could draw.\n\nA survey of players by ESPN in June indicated that just 46% of players were in favor of an 18-game schedule with stipulations, while 8% voted yes without stipulations.\n\nLawrence's plan is similar to Burrow's without going into detail about what could happen during the off weeks for players. Ultimately, whatever the NFL-NFLPA decides to do will be met with both praise and criticism from the player side. Without a perfect solution, the drawn-out process could put more power and money in the player's hands, in addition to more money in NFL owner's pockets.\n\nDemetrius Harvey is the Jacksonville Jaguars reporter for the Florida Times-Union.

Highs will warm into the upper 90s this weekend with some locations reaching near 100 degrees. While Friday looks mainly dry, the slight increase in the humid factor this weekend could cause a few isolated storms Saturday and Sunday. Lows will remain mild in the 70s.\n\nThe humid factor increases even more early next week and the heat remains in place! Highs will warm well into the upper 90s with scattered to isolated rain and storms. Lows will hover in the 70s.\n\nHeat index values will likely exceed 100 degrees early next week, meaning caution is urged when having outdoor plans in the high heat and humidity. Always a good reminder to remember the signs and symptoms of heat stroke and heat exhaustion.\n\nTracking the Tropics: The National Hurricane Center is watching a forming low pressure off the East Coast for potential development in the next week. Right now, it has a low, 10% chance for development in the next few days.

No severe weather is expected but a shower or storm is possible after 3 p.m. today.\n\nHumidity values begin to climb a little later this afternoon and evening. Highs reach the lower 80s across much of the state.\n\nTONIGHT: If you are heading to the Indianapolis Indians double header tonight be prepared for a few spotty storms. Temperatures at the first pitch will be in the 80s. Overnight lows fall into the lower 60s as showers and storms begin to end.\n\nFRIDAY: Heat and humidity rise for the end of the week and especially into the weekend. Highs climb into the middle 80s. Humidity values rise even more for the end of the week. Most of the day will be dry with a very low chance of a spotty storm.\n\nTHIS WEEKEND: The heat is on both Saturday and Sunday. Highs climb into the upper 80s near 90 for both weekend days. Humidity values make it feel so much more uncomfortable.

The Cape Fear region should also finally see some widespread drought relief into the weekend.\n\nA combination of an approaching cold front, offshore low pressure and air thick enough to chew should combine to produce some impressive rainfall totals across much of the area. The weekend will dry out and warm up again, and by early next week, temperatures will likely climb back toward 100 degrees.\n\nA weak cold front is working through the state, with slightly cooler, drier air briefly reaching the Cape Fear region. It's not much of a break, and it won't last long, but at least Fayetteville won't be sweltering under another heat advisory for a couple of days. Highs Thursday will hold at about 90, with morning lows of about 75.\n\nBy Friday morning, a huge high-pressure dome over the Atlantic will begin flexing to the west. At the same time, a weak low-pressure system off the Southeast coast will be nudged toward the Carolinas. It's not strong enough to cause any concern as far as wind, but the onshore flow around this low will enhance PWAT (potential rainfall) levels in the Cape Fear region.\n\nScattered showers should begin around daybreak, spreading west in the morning as the cold front retreats. Along that frontal boundary, rich moisture and instability should produce increasingly heavy rainfall. Showers will be slow-moving and isolated heavy totals could create local flooding.\n\nHighs across the areas will be hampered by clouds. Fayetteville may not top 85 degrees, with overnight lows in the mid-70s.\n\nDepending on the evolution of the front, showers could persist into Saturday morning. There's a decent chance of afternoon scattered showers, as well, given the amount of moisture aloft. Winds will ease around to the south, with highs in the region of about 90.\n\nSunday looks warmer and drier as the residual front fizzles out. Rain chances are limited to the usual popcorn showers, mainly along the Sea Breeze Line south and east of Fayetteville. Highs will hit the low 90s, and triple-digit heat indices will return.\n\nMiserable midsummer heat and humidity return as high pressure builds back over the Carolinas. Popcorn showers should provide spotty relief, but most of us will see highs in the mid- to upper 90s and a heat index pushing 110.\n\nRain chances should increase Thursday into Friday as another front approaches. Timing is uncertain at this point, but temperatures will remain unpleasant. Hey, it's July in Fayetteville!\n\nAs what's left of Beryl winds down over Michigan, things have calmed down in the Atlantic. The combination of shear and dry air will continue for at least another week, perhaps longer.\n\nHave a great, if wet, weekend!\n\nGot a weather question?

If you want to see how your town ranked for rainfall, tap HERE.\n\nBut now, the air is muggier from the rain. Combine that with some south winds to bring higher heat and humidity farther north. Heat index values are likely to top in the low 100s by Sunday and Monday.\n\nBecause of the higher humidity, more pop-up storm chances are likely. Any water that falls will help raise the humidity. Then, that increases more rain chances. It's a humid and wet cycle that feeds on itself.\n\nVery humid and unsettled weather is likely for central Indiana for the next week. It is July... expect lots of sunshine with spotty rain chances in the afternoons and evenings.\n\nThe jet stream is going to park just north of Indiana for the next several days. That's where the highest rain and storm chance will be. However, storms like to turn into warmer and more humid air. Rain chances will push south every time toward central Indiana in the evenings. These rain chances will remain hit-or-miss as they move south.\n\nThis pattern is a ridge, and the storms that form on the NW flow portions are called ridge riders. This northwest flow can be turbulent. The highest chance for severe storms will be to the north.\n\nThe heat index will get higher and higher day by day. The air temperature is going up, and the humidity level is going up, too. These are the top heat index temperatures we are expecting in Indianapolis:\n\nSunday is the first day we will likely hit heat index values near 100 degrees in the afternoon.

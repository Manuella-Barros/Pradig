The Chiefs have set a deadline of six months from now to decide on a plan for the future of Arrowhead Stadium, whether that means renovating their iconic home or building an entirely new stadium in Kansas or Missouri.\n\nST. JOSEPH, Mo. (AP) -- The Chiefs have set a deadline of six months from now to decide on a plan for the future of Arrowhead Stadium, whether that means renovating their iconic home or building an entirely new stadium in Kansas or Missouri.\n\nAfter a joint ballot initiative with the Royals to help fund facilities by extending a sales tax was rejected by voters in Jackson County, Missouri, earlier this year, the teams agreed to move forward with separate plans. Now, they are waiting for the leaders in both states that comprise the Kansas City metro to put forward their best pitches.\n\nLegislators in Kansas approved a plan last month that would finance up to 70% of the cost of new stadiums for pro sports franchises with an eye on luring the Chiefs across the state line. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson responded a week later by saying he expects his state to put together an aid plan by the end of the year to keep the teams on its side of the metro.\n\n\"This is a generational decision. This is going to impact the future of this franchise for generations,\" Chiefs president Mark Donovan said Friday, the day that veterans reported to training camp at Missouri Western in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\n\"We have to get this right,\" Donovan said. \"We are going to do the due-diligence. We are going to take our time and do it right. But there is a reality to the timing. You can only take so much time to get it right. And that window is starting to close.\"\n\nThe Chiefs and Royals have played for more than five decades at the Truman Sports Complex, where a lease agreement calls for the use of a sales tax for their upkeep. And while Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium remain beloved by fans, the reality is both are becoming outdated, and it's unclear how long they would last even if they were renovated again.\n\nRoyals owner John Sherman has said his team will not play at Kauffman beyond the 2030 season, preferring instead to build a new downtown ballpark. The Chiefs initially hoped to renovate Arrowhead but are becoming more open to building new.\n\nChiefs owner Clark Hunt has long hoped to host a Super Bowl, and that would be more likely with a new stadium. If it included a retractable roof, the stadium also could land lucrative events such as the Final Four and college football playoff games.\n\nOne factor working against Missouri is its uncertain political environment. Parson cannot run for reelection due to term limits, and that means the Chiefs must wait until later this fall to know who they would be working with going forward.\n\n\"Really the deadline is how can you be up and running in a new facility or a renovated facility for January of the 2031 season,\" Donovan said. \"You're looking at an existing structure, something we've done a lot of work on, there is a little less lead time. If you are talking about something new, it extends the lead time a year and a half. So we feel like we're in the window now to get something done in the next six months to be in a good position. That's the timeline we're working on.\"\n\nDonovan said another factor in the decision is quite simple: real estate.\n\nIf the Chiefs build new, they want enough land for 20,000 parking spaces, so the franchise can retain its well-known tailgating tradition. They also would have to decide whether a new training facility -- their current one is located near Arrowhead Stadium but is also becoming outdated -- would be built near a potential new stadium or stand alone elsewhere.\n\n\"It's important to understand that we are playing Chiefs football home games at GEHA Field at Arrowhead (into) 2031. That is our plan,\" Donovan said. \"What we have to have is somewhere to play our games for the '31 season. To do that, we have to back up to, when do you build? If you're renovating, how do you do it over multiple seasons while still playing there? A lot of factors go into that. We need to have options, and we need to have those options to a point of definition to make a decision.\"\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType":

JOSEPH, Mo. (AP) - The Chiefs have set a deadline of six months from now to decide on a plan for the future of Arrowhead Stadium, whether that means renovating their iconic home or building an entirely new stadium in Kansas or Missouri.\n\nAfter a joint ballot initiative with the Royals to help fund facilities by extending a sales tax was rejected by voters in Jackson County, Missouri, earlier this year, the teams agreed to move forward with separate plans. Now, they are waiting for the leaders in both states that comprise the Kansas City metro to put forward their best pitches.\n\nLegislators in Kansas approved a plan last month that would finance up to 70% of the cost of new stadiums for pro sports franchises with an eye on luring the Chiefs across the state line. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson responded a week later by saying he expects his state to put together an aid plan by the end of the year to keep the teams on its side of the metro.\n\n\"This is a generational decision. This is going to impact the future of this franchise for generations,\" Chiefs president Mark Donovan said Friday, the day that veterans reported to training camp at Missouri Western in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\n\"We have to get this right,\" Donovan said. \"We are going to do the due-diligence. We are going to take our time and do it right. But there is a reality to the timing. You can only take so much time to get it right. And that window is starting to close.\"\n\nThe Chiefs and Royals have played for more than five decades at the Truman Sports Complex, where a lease agreement calls for the use of a sales tax for their upkeep. And while Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium remain beloved by fans, the reality is both are becoming outdated, and it's unclear how long they would last even if they were renovated again.\n\nFILE - Fans cheer at Arrowhead Stadium during the first half of an NFL football game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Detroit Lions, Sept. 7, 202, in Kansas City, Mo.

(AP Photo/Reed Hoffmann. File)\n\nRoyals owner John Sherman has said his team will not play at Kauffman beyond the 2030 season, preferring instead to build a new downtown ballpark. The Chiefs initially hoped to renovate Arrowhead but are becoming more open to building new.\n\nChiefs owner Clark Hunt has long hoped to host a Super Bowl, and that would be more likely with a new stadium. If it included a retractable roof, the stadium also could land lucrative events such as the Final Four and college football playoff games.\n\nOne factor working against Missouri is its uncertain political environment. Parson cannot run for reelection due to term limits, and that means the Chiefs must wait until later this fall to know who they would be working with going forward.\n\n\"Really the deadline is how can you be up and running in a new facility or a renovated facility for January of the 2031 season,\" Donovan said. \"You're looking at an existing structure, something we've done a lot of work on, there is a little less lead time. If you are talking about something new, it extends the lead time a year and a half. So we feel like we're in the window now to get something done in the next six months to be in a good position. That's the timeline we're working on.\"\n\nDonovan said another factor in the decision is quite simple: real estate.\n\nIf the Chiefs build new, they want enough land for 20,000 parking spaces, so the franchise can retain its well-known tailgating tradition. They also would have to decide whether a new training facility - their current one is located near Arrowhead Stadium but is also becoming outdated - would be built near a potential new stadium or stand alone elsewhere.\n\n\"It's important to understand that we are playing Chiefs football home games at GEHA Field at Arrowhead (into) 2031. That is our plan,\" Donovan said. \"What we have to have is somewhere to play our games for the '31 season. To do that, we have to back up to, when do you build? If you\u00b4re renovating, how do you do it over multiple seasons while still playing there? A lot of factors go into that. We need to have options, and we need to have those options to a point of definition to make a decision.\"\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\nFILE - Kansas City Chiefs fans gather outside Arrowhead Stadium before a NFL football game against the Oakland Raiders Sunday, Sept. 20, 2009 in Kansas City, Mo.

JOSEPH, Mo. (AP) -- The Chiefs have set a deadline of six months from now to decide on a plan for the future of Arrowhead Stadium, whether that means renovating their iconic home or building an entirely new stadium in Kansas or Missouri.\n\nAfter a joint ballot initiative with the Royals to help fund facilities by extending a sales tax was rejected by voters in Jackson County, Missouri, earlier this year, the teams agreed to move forward with separate plans. Now, they are waiting for the leaders in both states that comprise the Kansas City metro to put forward their best pitches.\n\nLegislators in Kansas approved a plan last month that would finance up to 70% of the cost of new stadiums for pro sports franchises with an eye on luring the Chiefs across the state line. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson responded a week later by saying he expects his state to put together an aid plan by the end of the year to keep the teams on its side of the metro.\n\n\"This is a generational decision. This is going to impact the future of this franchise for generations,\" Chiefs president Mark Donovan said Friday, the day that veterans reported to training camp at Missouri Western in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\n\"We have to get this right,\" Donovan said. \"We are going to do the due-diligence. We are going to take our time and do it right. But there is a reality to the timing. You can only take so much time to get it right. And that window is starting to close.\"\n\nThe Chiefs and Royals have played for more than five decades at the Truman Sports Complex, where a lease agreement calls for the use of a sales tax for their upkeep. And while Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium remain beloved by fans, the reality is both are becoming outdated, and it's unclear how long they would last even if they were renovated again.\n\nRoyals owner John Sherman has said his team will not play at Kauffman beyond the 2030 season, preferring instead to build a new downtown ballpark. The Chiefs initially hoped to renovate Arrowhead but are becoming more open to building new.\n\nChiefs owner Clark Hunt has long hoped to host a Super Bowl, and that would be more likely with a new stadium. If it included a retractable roof, the stadium also could land lucrative events such as the Final Four and college football playoff games.\n\nOne factor working against Missouri is its uncertain political environment. Parson cannot run for reelection due to term limits, and that means the Chiefs must wait until later this fall to know who they would be working with going forward.\n\n\"Really the deadline is how can you be up and running in a new facility or a renovated facility for January of the 2031 season,\" Donovan said. \"You're looking at an existing structure, something we've done a lot of work on, there is a little less lead time. If you are talking about something new, it extends the lead time a year and a half. So we feel like we're in the window now to get something done in the next six months to be in a good position. That's the timeline we're working on.\"\n\nDonovan said another factor in the decision is quite simple: real estate.\n\nIf the Chiefs build new, they want enough land for 20,000 parking spaces, so the franchise can retain its well-known tailgating tradition. They also would have to decide whether a new training facility -- their current one is located near Arrowhead Stadium but is also becoming outdated -- would be built near a potential new stadium or stand alone elsewhere.\n\n\"It's important to understand that we are playing Chiefs football home games at GEHA Field at Arrowhead (into) 2031. That is our plan,\" Donovan said. \"What we have to have is somewhere to play our games for the '31 season. To do that, we have to back up to, when do you build? If you're renovating, how do you do it over multiple seasons while still playing there? A lot of factors go into that.

Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports / Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nKansas City Chiefs team president Mark Donovan spoke to the media on Friday as the Chiefs ramp training camp activities at Missouri Western State University in St. Joseph, Missouri. After discussing the team's plans for this year of camp, Donovan addressed a much-discussed issue for the future of the Chiefs: their search for a long-term stadium solution.\n\nFollowing a failed vote on a proposal that would have extended funding to the Chiefs and Kansas City Royals in April, Donovan reiterated several times on Friday that the Chiefs are keeping their future options open and that the team has a six-month timeline on their next step in the decision-making process.\n\nDonovan was asked specifically about the STAR Bonds recently passed in a bill by the Kansas state legislature and how seriously the Chiefs are taking Kansas' pursuit of the team.\n\n\"We appreciate the efforts that the Kansas legislature made to really supercharge STAR Bonds to make it make sense for a professional sports team to come over there and take advantage of that,\" Donovan said. \"It is consistent with what we've talked about, that we want to look at options. It seems, at least my general understanding of it, that this is a really good option for us to consider so we appreciate that. We are in discussions with the folks in Kansas. We are in discussions, continue our discussions, with folks in Missouri. Talking to various leaders, there seem to be other options that are coming up now on the Missouri side, so we appreciate that, and it's consistent with our strategy, which was, 'If this doesn't work,' which was our plan, that we've got to look at options, and now we'll have a couple option to look at.\"\n\nIn a follow-up question, Donovan was asked if the Chiefs are seriously considering going to the state of Kansas.\n\n\"Yeah, we'll seriously consider all options, absolutely,\" Donovan said.\n\nDonovan was then asked about the team's timeline and potential deadlines as the team waits to find out who the next governor of Missouri will be, with primary elections taking place on August 6.\n\n\"I think when you talk about deadlines, really the deadline is: how can you be up and running in a new facility or a renovated facility for the '31 season,\" Donovan said. \"Those are two different timelines, if you're renovating Arrowhead, GEHA Field, you're looking at an existing structure, it's something we've done a lot of work on, so it's a little bit smaller lead-time you need there. If you're building something new either in Missouri or in Kansas, it extends that lead-time by about a year and a half. So, we feel like we're in that window right now, we feel like we need to get something done in the next six months to figure out and be in a good position, so that's the timeline we're working on.\"\n\nDonovan was asked, among all of the options the Chiefs are considering, if the team is still open to remaining at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\n\"Very much so,\" Donovan said. \"Very much so. I would say every option is on the table.\"\n\nAsked about the fact that the organization had previously expressed that remaining at a renovated Arrowhead was the team's preference, Donovan acknowledged that the team may be viewing their options differently, not committing to Arrowhead as their top choice.\n\n\"Given the results of the vote, we have a much more measured response to that, which is, 'We want to look at our options,'\" Donovan said. \"We went all-in, and failed pretty badly, and obviously a lot of different situations, lot of different variables in that, but we're looking at it as a measured response of, 'What makes the most sense for our fans, what makes the most sense for our franchise and this organization, and what makes the most sense and can have the biggest impact on this region?' And I think the positive of this is that we do have options, and we'll consider those. I've said this to you guys multiple times: this is a generational decision.

The Chiefs have set a deadline of six months from now to decide on a plan for the future of Arrowhead Stadium, whether that means renovating their iconic home or building an entirely new stadium in Kansas or Missouri.\n\nBy DAVE SKRETTA - AP Sports Writer\n\nST. JOSEPH, Mo. (AP) -- The Chiefs have set a deadline of six months from now to decide on a plan for the future of Arrowhead Stadium, whether that means renovating their iconic home or building an entirely new stadium in Kansas or Missouri.\n\nAfter a joint ballot initiative with the Royals to help fund facilities by extending a sales tax was rejected by voters in Jackson County, Missouri, earlier this year, the teams agreed to move forward with separate plans. Now, they are waiting for the leaders in both states that comprise the Kansas City metro to put forward their best pitches.\n\nLegislators in Kansas approved a plan last month that would finance up to 70% of the cost of new stadiums for pro sports franchises with an eye on luring the Chiefs across the state line. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson responded a week later by saying he expects his state to put together an aid plan by the end of the year to keep the teams on its side of the metro.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nFormer St. Louis officials Lewis Reed, John Collins-Muhammad released from federal prison Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley elects not to pitch in All-Star Game, replaced on NL roster New St. Louis Public Schools communications chief also lives in Texas St. Charles teacher sexually abused teen girl for years, police say 'Steal of the draft': Cardinals pounce at No. 7 on collegiate infielder JJ Wetherholt Cardinals TV analyst Jim Edmonds draws controversy with Cubs celebration gripe Trump injured but 'fine' after attempted assassination at rally; shooter and one attendee are dead Grades for Cardinals position players: the good, bad and ugly St. Louis Public Schools halts hiring over questions on new administrator from Texas St. Louis hosts emergency and military training for massive earthquake O'Fallon, Mo., firm to expand, add jobs with millions in federal dollars for semiconductor push MSD's recently retired CEO was paid more than $100,000 for unused vacation, sick time New report says MetroLink expansion in St. Louis would aid economy HOA rules in the St. Louis area can turn into fighting words Former St. Louis County health department employee pleads guilty to soliciting bribes\n\n\"This is a generational decision. This is going to impact the future of this franchise for generations,\" Chiefs president Mark Donovan said Friday, the day that veterans reported to training camp at Missouri Western in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\n\"We have to get this right,\" Donovan said. \"We are going to do the due-diligence. We are going to take our time and do it right. But there is a reality to the timing. You can only take so much time to get it right. And that window is starting to close.\"\n\nThe Chiefs and Royals have played for more than five decades at the Truman Sports Complex, where a lease agreement calls for the use of a sales tax for their upkeep. And while Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium remain beloved by fans, the reality is both are becoming outdated, and it's unclear how long they would last even if they were renovated again.\n\nRoyals owner John Sherman has said his team will not play at Kauffman beyond the 2030 season, preferring instead to build a new downtown ballpark. The Chiefs initially hoped to renovate Arrowhead but are becoming more open to building new.\n\nChiefs owner Clark Hunt has long hoped to host a Super Bowl, and that would be more likely with a new stadium. If it included a retractable roof, the stadium also could land lucrative events such as the Final Four and college football playoff games.\n\nOne factor working against Missouri is its uncertain political environment. Parson cannot run for reelection due to term limits, and that means the Chiefs must wait until later this fall to know who they would be working with going forward.\n\n\"Really the deadline is how can you be up and running in a new facility or a renovated facility for January of the 2031 season,\" Donovan said. \"You're looking at an existing structure, something we've done a lot of work on, there is a little less lead time. If you are talking about something new, it extends the lead time a year and a half. So we feel like we're in the window now to get something done in the next six months to be in a good position. That's the timeline we're working on.\"\n\nDonovan said another factor in the decision is quite simple: real estate.\n\nIf the Chiefs build new, they want enough land for 20,000 parking spaces, so the franchise can retain its well-known tailgating tradition. They also would have to decide whether a new training facility -- their current one is located near Arrowhead Stadium but is also becoming outdated -- would be built near a potential new stadium or stand alone elsewhere.\n\n\"It's important to understand that we are playing Chiefs football home games at GEHA Field at Arrowhead (into) 2031. That is our plan,\" Donovan said. \"What we have to have is somewhere to play our games for the '31 season. To do that, we have to back up to, when do you build? If you're renovating, how do you do it over multiple seasons while still playing there? A lot of factors go into that. We need to have options, and we need to have those options to a point of definition to make a decision.\"\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

JOSEPH, Mo. -- The Chiefs have set a deadline of six months from now to decide on a plan for the future of Arrowhead Stadium, whether that means renovating their iconic home or building an entirely new stadium in Kansas or Missouri.\n\nAfter a joint ballot initiative with the Royals to help fund facilities by extending a sales tax was rejected by voters in Jackson County, Missouri, earlier this year, the teams agreed to move forward with separate plans. Now, they are waiting for the leaders in both states that comprise the Kansas City metro to put forward their best pitches.\n\nLegislators in Kansas approved a plan last month that would finance up to 70% of the cost of new stadiums for pro sports franchises with an eye on luring the Chiefs across the state line. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson responded a week later by saying he expects his state to put together an aid plan by the end of the year to keep the teams on its side of the metro.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nJohn Deere will lay off an undetermined number of salaried workers beginning next week One dead in early morning shooting in Hudson Interstate traffic shut down for person on bridge Man who had himself banned from Iowa casinos wins jackpot at the Isle UPDATE: Man who died in lawnmower accident was Don Bosco teacher Waterloo day care operator charged with three counts of child endangerment Name released in Hudson fatal shooting Denver girls' track coach fired for unknown reason despite petition from community Man arrested for knife threats at Waterloo apartment building Apartment hit in weekend shooting High School Baseball: Don Bosco wins substate thriller over Saint Ansgar High School Baseball: Johnston survives Cedar Falls in 13-inning 4A substate classic Waterloo council votes 4-2 to allow for construction of tiny home UPDATE WITH NAME: One dead in tanker crash south of Hudson UPDATE: 15 year old injured in reported shooting\n\n\"This is a generational decision. This is going to impact the future of this franchise for generations,\" Chiefs president Mark Donovan said Friday, the day that veterans reported to training camp at Missouri Western in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\n\"We have to get this right,\" Donovan said. \"We are going to do the due-diligence. We are going to take our time and do it right. But there is a reality to the timing. You can only take so much time to get it right. And that window is starting to close.\"\n\nThe Chiefs and Royals have played for more than five decades at the Truman Sports Complex, where a lease agreement calls for the use of a sales tax for their upkeep. And while Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium remain beloved by fans, the reality is both are becoming outdated, and it's unclear how long they would last even if they were renovated again.\n\nRoyals owner John Sherman has said his team will not play at Kauffman beyond the 2030 season, preferring instead to build a new downtown ballpark. The Chiefs initially hoped to renovate Arrowhead but are becoming more open to building new.\n\nChiefs owner Clark Hunt has long hoped to host a Super Bowl, and that would be more likely with a new stadium. If it included a retractable roof, the stadium also could land lucrative events such as the Final Four and college football playoff games.\n\nOne factor working against Missouri is its uncertain political environment. Parson cannot run for reelection due to term limits, and that means the Chiefs must wait until later this fall to know who they would be working with going forward.\n\nDonovan said another factor in the decision is quite simple: real estate.\n\nIf the Chiefs build new, they want enough land for 20,000 parking spaces, so the franchise can retain its well-known tailgating tradition. They also would have to decide whether a new training facility -- their current one is located near Arrowhead Stadium but is also becoming outdated -- would be built near a potential new stadium or stand alone elsewhere.\n\n\"It's important to understand that we are playing Chiefs football home games at GEHA Field at Arrowhead (into) 2031. That is our plan,\" Donovan said. \"What we have to have is somewhere to play our games for the '31 season. To do that, we have to back up to, when do you build? If you're renovating, how do you do it over multiple seasons while still playing there? A lot of factors go into that.

JOSEPH, Mo. -- Even before the Kansas City Chiefs held their first full-team practice at training camp for their 2024 campaign, as they aim for an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl victory, the team has put a self-imposed deadline on deciding the future of its home venue beyond the 2030 season.\n\nTeam president Mark Donovan acknowledged in a news conference Friday that the franchise plans to make a determination in six months on what stadium and which side of the state line, Missouri or Kansas, it will play its home games in.\n\nDonovan shared that it's possible that Chiefs could continue playing inside Arrowhead Stadium, which will be one of the host sites for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, after the team's current lease expires after Jan. 31, 2031 with another major renovation of the 52-year-old structure. But Donovan also said the Chiefs could elect to build a new stadium in Missouri or Kansas.\n\nThe Chiefs' deadline comes three months after voters in Jackson County, Mo., rejected to approve an extension of the three-eighths-cent sales tax on a ballot initiative to ensure the Chiefs and the Kansas City Royals remained in the county for at least the next 25 years. The margin of defeat for the teams was overwhelming, too. Once 100 percent of the votes were counted, 78,352 people voted no (58 percent) while 56,606 voted yes (42 percent).\n\n\"Given the results of the vote, we have a much more measured response, which is we want to look at our options,\" Donovan said. \"We went all-in (on the April ballot) and failed pretty badly. What makes the most sense for our fans? What makes the most sense for our franchise? And what makes the most sense and can have the biggest impact on this region? The positive of this is we do have options.\n\n\"This is a generational decision. This is going to impact the future of this franchise for generations. We've got to get it right. We are going to take our time to do it right.\"\n\nLast month, legislators in Kansas approved, with bipartisan support, state bonds to aid in financing new stadiums and practice facilities for both teams.\n\n\"Kansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse.\" Gov. Laura Kellys said then in a statement.\n\nIf the Chiefs move to Kansas, the state bonds could cover up to 70 percent of the cost to build a new stadium. The bonds would then be paid off over a 30-year period through revenue from sports betting, state lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from an entertainment district built around the stadium.\n\n\"It was amazing what Kansas did,\" Donovan said. \"We really appreciate the leadership, (Republican Senate President) Ty Masterson and (House Speaker) Dan Hawkins and the Governor in putting that together. That's the first step. Once you get through that, it gets really complicated. For us, the good news is that it creates more options. There are multiple options in Kansas that we can look at.\"\n\nIn the past few years, developers from Kansas have sent the Chiefs proposals on a new stadium, a process that Donovan expects to continue for much of the next six months. In those discussions, developers have recommended multiple sites that are attractive for a state-of-the-art NFL stadium. A logical destination could be in Kansas City, Kan., near the Kansas Speedway and Children's Mercy Park, the home venue of Sporting Kansas City.\n\n\"We feel like we're a pretty valuable (financial) asset to wherever we go,\" Donovan said. \"We think we've been really good partners to the state (of Missouri), the county (Jackson) and the city.\n\n\"We do believe that we're a unique asset that would bring something that (Kansas) has never had before. The messages that we've gotten from the leaders in Kansas, from those who have worked on star bond projects before, is that this is the most valuable opportunity they've ever had, so that's how we look at it.\"\n\nPrior to April's vote, the Chiefs expressed their commitment to staying in the Truman Sports Complex, which is where the venues for the two teams have been since 1973, as the teams are sharing the lease that runs through Jan. 31, 2031.\n\nDays ahead of the vote, John Sherman, the Royals' new owner, said the team would pledge at least $1 billion from their ownership group for its project, a downtown ballpark in Kansas City, one that would ideally be opened by the 2028 season. Arrowhead's projected renovations were expected to cost $800 million. Chiefs club owner Clark Hunt said he and his family would contribute $300 million. The Chiefs in late February unveiled renderings of what the renovations at Arrowhead would be, changes that would enhance suites, video boards and club lounges.\n\nSeveral leaders in the city and county, however, felt the financial commitments from the Royals and Chiefs weren't enough. Jackson County executive Frank White, who is in the Royals Hall of Fame, never fully agreed to the proposal. KC Tenants, a tenants' rights and housing advocacy group that has 10,000 members, also campaigned against the proposal, urging voters to reject the extension by stressing that taxpayers would pay too large of a percentage to help build a new ballpark and further modernize Arrowhead.\n\n\"We have to acknowledge that that did not go over as we thought it would,\" Donovan said of the Chiefs' renovation plan. \"If you really look at those renderings, and what we had planned, it's a really exciting project. I think a lot of people went into that presentation with, 'We're going to see a dome and we're going to see this incredible retail facility around it.'\n\n\"That's just not reality. In that location, we're not going to retrofit Arrowhead with a dome. If you talk to developers, that region right now (near Independence, Mo.) is not a place you would develop around.\"\n\nWhile the Royals want to play in a new ballpark before the end of their lease at Truman Sports Complex, Donovan was empathic in saying that the Chiefs will play all of their home games at Arrowhead through the 2030 season.\n\n\"Clark has been adamant about that, saying, 'We have a lease, and we're playing our games,'\" Donovan said. \"His conversations with me are like, 'Figure out your plan around it.'\"\n\nIf the Chiefs agree to move to Kansas, the construction of their new stadium for the 2031 season could begin in 2028. Hunt shared in late April, during the NFL Draft, that the new venue could be an open-air stadium or one with a dome.\n\n\"If you're talking about a new dome stadium, you're at $2.5 to $3 billion,\" Donovan said. \"If your star bonds are $1 billion or $1.5 billion, then where is the other half coming from? That quickly turns into how are you going to finance it. That (would be) a significant commitment by the (Hunt) family.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nate_taylor@nytimes.com",

JOSEPH, Mo. -- The Kansas City Chiefs went all-in and failed \"pretty badly\" as an April vote for a renovated Arrowhead Stadium fell flat, team president Mark Donovan said.\n\nNow, the Chiefs are continuing discussions with officials from both Kansas and Missouri to figure out the team's future location after their lease at Arrowhead expires following the 2030 season. Donovan said they're looking at the failed vote as an opportunity to consider what makes the most sense for fans and the future of the franchise.\n\n\"This is a generational decision,\" Donovan said. \"This is going to impact the future of this franchise for generations. We've got to get it right and we are going to do the due diligence.\"\n\nThe Chiefs and the Kansas City Royals went to voters in Jackson County, Missouri, in April hoping to extend an existing three-eighth-cent sales tax for two facilities: a renovated Arrowhead for the Chiefs and a new stadium for the Royals. The measure failed, with more than 58% of voters rejecting it.\n\nThat defeat led the Chiefs to broaden their search for a new plan. Donovan said the team staying in a renovated Arrowhead is \"very much an option\" and building a new stadium at the Arrowhead site is in play too.\n\n\"We have to look at a new building,'' Donovan said. \"We're open to it. We're open to a new building on the complex, we're open to a new building somewhere else. We're open to a dome or an outdoor [facility] as a new building.

Dave Skretta of the Associated Press provided the details, which also involved MLB's Kansas City Royals.\n\n\"More than 58% of voters ultimately rejected the plan, which would have replaced an existing three-eighths of a cent sales tax that has been paying for the upkeep of Truman Sports Complex -- the home for more than 50 years to Kauffman and Arrowhead Stadiums -- with a similar tax that would have been in place for the next 40 years.\n\n\"The Royals, who had pledged at least $1 billion from ownership for their project, wanted to use their share of the tax revenue to help fund a $2 billion-plus ballpark district. The Super Bowl champion Chiefs, who had committed $300 million in private money, would have used their share as part of an $800 million overhaul of Arrowhead Stadium.\"\n\nThe stadium has been open since 1972 and was notably renovated for $375 million from 2007-2010. It has received good reviews, although the atmosphere created by fans outside (for tailgates) and inside the stadium stands out the most.\n\nIn the latest NFLPA survey, the Chiefs' facilities notably received very poor reviews, including an F for the locker room and a D for the training room.\n\nThe Chiefs are sticking around Arrowhead Stadium for at least six more years, but now it's unclear what the plan of action will be afterward. Donovan provided some thoughts.\n\n\"We have to look at a new building,'' Donovan said. \"We're open to it. We're open to a new building on the complex. We're open to a new building somewhere else.

JOSEPH, Mo. -- The Chiefs have set a deadline of six months from now to decide on a plan for the future of Arrowhead Stadium, whether that means renovating their iconic home or building an entirely new stadium in Kansas or Missouri.\n\nAfter a joint ballot initiative with the Royals to help fund facilities by extending a sales tax was rejected by voters in Jackson County, Missouri, earlier this year, the teams agreed to move forward with separate plans. Now, they are waiting for the leaders in both states that comprise the Kansas City metro to put forward their best pitches.\n\nLegislators in Kansas approved a plan last month that would finance up to 70% of the cost of new stadiums for pro sports franchises with an eye on luring the Chiefs across the state line. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson responded a week later by saying he expects his state to put together an aid plan by the end of the year to keep the teams on its side of the metro.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nUPDATED: Okoboji lakes fall below target for lifting boat speeding limits Sioux City school district settles student injury lawsuit for $175,000 State seeks to use Dakota Dunes homicide suspect's confession at trial Dan Greenwell to pay $52.7K in attorney fees to former Sioux City superintendent Paul Gausman Hinton man wins $100K in Iowa Lottery scratch game Sioux City Career Academy house sells for $150,000 to couple impacted by flooding 2 arrested after I-29 pursuit in Woodbury County High school baseball: Bleeker's walk-off lifts Crusaders over Warriors in substate final Overnight fire closes Spirit Lake Walmart City of Okoboji urges governor to increase releases from Iowa Great Lakes Marriage licenses for Woodbury County for July 14, 2024 Trump injured but 'fine' after attempted assassination at rally; shooter and one attendee are dead Woodbury County Court Report for July 15, 2024 Driver who hit dead deer dies in crash near Yankton 'I will be glad when it all calms down': Sioux City flood victims still waiting for normalcy\n\n\"This is a generational decision. This is going to impact the future of this franchise for generations,\" Chiefs president Mark Donovan said Friday, the day that veterans reported to training camp at Missouri Western in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\n\"We have to get this right,\" Donovan said. \"We are going to do the due-diligence. We are going to take our time and do it right. But there is a reality to the timing. You can only take so much time to get it right. And that window is starting to close.\"\n\nThe Chiefs and Royals have played for more than five decades at the Truman Sports Complex, where a lease agreement calls for the use of a sales tax for their upkeep. And while Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium remain beloved by fans, the reality is both are becoming outdated, and it's unclear how long they would last even if they were renovated again.\n\nRoyals owner John Sherman has said his team will not play at Kauffman beyond the 2030 season, preferring instead to build a new downtown ballpark. The Chiefs initially hoped to renovate Arrowhead but are becoming more open to building new.\n\nChiefs owner Clark Hunt has long hoped to host a Super Bowl, and that would be more likely with a new stadium. If it included a retractable roof, the stadium also could land lucrative events such as the Final Four and college football playoff games.\n\nOne factor working against Missouri is its uncertain political environment. Parson cannot run for reelection due to term limits, and that means the Chiefs must wait until later this fall to know who they would be working with going forward.\n\nChiefs' vets report: The veterans have arrived at training camp for the Kansas City Chiefs. But given that Travis Kelce and Co. have proven what they can do, helping the Chiefs with a third Super Bowl in five years last season, their biggest responsibility might be ushering along a bunch of rookies that have been working for a few days already. Guys such as wide receiver Xavier Worthy, their first-round pick out of Texas, and left tackle Kingsley Suamataia, their second-rounder out of BYU, have a legitimate chance to earn a starting job for the defending champions.\n\nBears' Williams ready for spotlight\n\nLAKE FOREST, Ill. -- Caleb Williams is ready for what comes next.\n\nThe No. 1 overall draft pick and 2022 Heisman Trophy winner is embracing the spotlight in Chicago after playing a starring role in Hollywood as the quarterback at USC. All eyes will be on him when the Bears begin training camp Saturday.\n\n\"I've kind of put myself in this position many times before I became a Chicago Bear on the 25th of April,\" Williams said Friday.\n\nThe Bears are banking on Williams to give them a big lift and solidify a position that has historically been a sore spot for the founding NFL franchise. But he's also in a rather rare situation for a No. 1 pick, joining a team that's one of the league's shiny objects at the moment.\n\nThe Bears made several big moves to boost their offense and have their sights set on making the playoffs, something they've done just three times since the 2006 Super Bowl season. They're also trying to secure funding to build an enclosed lakefront stadium, though they could turn their attention back to a tract of land they own in suburban Arlington Heights, Illinois, if a deal doesn't go through. With all those storylines, they'll have HBO's \"Hard Knocks\" cameras following them during camp.\n\nThere's quite a buzz for a team with a 10-24 record in two seasons under general manager Ryan Poles and coach Matt Eberflus. But after going 7-10 last season, the Bears have their sights set higher.\n\nBRIEFLY\n\nJAGUARS: Jacksonville filed a lawsuit against a former employee who is serving prison time after pleading guilty to stealing $22 million from the NFL team's virtual credit card program. The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Duval County Circuit Court, seeks more than $66 million in damages, or three times the amount Amit Patel admitted stealing to feed a gambling addiction and a lavish lifestyle.\n\nRAVENS: Baltimore has agreed to a one-year deal with former Chicago Bears safety Eddie Jackson. The Ravens announced the deal Friday, two days before they start training camp.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to

JOSEPH, Mo. -- The Chiefs have set a deadline of six months from now to decide on a plan for the future of Arrowhead Stadium, whether that means renovating their iconic home or building an entirely new stadium in Kansas or Missouri.\n\nAfter a joint ballot initiative with the Royals to help fund facilities by extending a sales tax was rejected by voters in Jackson County, Missouri, earlier this year, the teams agreed to move forward with separate plans. Now, they are waiting for the leaders in both states that comprise the Kansas City metro to put forward their best pitches.\n\nLegislators in Kansas approved a plan last month that would finance up to 70% of the cost of new stadiums for pro sports franchises with an eye on luring the Chiefs across the state line. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson responded a week later by saying he expects his state to put together an aid plan by the end of the year to keep the teams on its side of the metro.\n\n\"This is a generational decision. This is going to impact the future of this franchise for generations,\" Chiefs president Mark Donovan said Friday, the day that veterans reported to training camp at Missouri Western in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\n\"We have to get this right,\" Donovan said. \"We are going to do the due-diligence. We are going to take our time and do it right. But there is a reality to the timing. You can only take so much time to get it right. And that window is starting to close.\"\n\nThe Chiefs and Royals have played for more than five decades at the Truman Sports Complex, where a lease agreement calls for the use of a sales tax for their upkeep. And while Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium remain beloved by fans, the reality is both are becoming outdated, and it's unclear how long they would last even if they were renovated again.\n\nRoyals owner John Sherman has said his team will not play at Kauffman beyond the 2030 season, preferring instead to build a new downtown ballpark. The Chiefs initially hoped to renovate Arrowhead but are becoming more open to building new.\n\nChiefs owner Clark Hunt has long hoped to host a Super Bowl, and that would be more likely with a new stadium. If it included a retractable roof, the stadium also could land lucrative events such as the Final Four and college football playoff games.\n\nOne factor working against Missouri is its uncertain political environment. Parson cannot run for reelection due to term limits, and that means the Chiefs must wait until later this fall to know who they would be working with going forward.\n\nChiefs' vets report: The veterans have arrived at training camp for the Kansas City Chiefs.

Guys such as wide receiver Xavier Worthy, their first-round pick out of Texas, and left tackle Kingsley Suamataia, their second-rounder out of BYU, have a legitimate chance to earn a starting job for the defending champions.\n\nBears' Williams ready for spotlight\n\nLAKE FOREST, Ill. -- Caleb Williams is ready for what comes next.\n\nThe No. 1 overall draft pick and 2022 Heisman Trophy winner is embracing the spotlight in Chicago after playing a starring role in Hollywood as the quarterback at USC.

That lease expires at the end of January in 2031, though Donovan and the organization feel that it requires a substantial renovation to remain competitive after 52 years. There's another option: moving out of Arrowhead entirely.\n\nThe Chiefs have explored building a new facility in Kansas or Missouri, depending on who makes the best offer. The state of Kansas has already created a pathway for the Chiefs to leave their long-time home in Missouri.\n\nREAD: Chiefs, Royals Could Have Easier Path To Leaving Missouri\n\nDonovan spoke about the disastrous results of a ballot measure rejected by Kansas City voters in April, that would have extended an existing sales tax to pay for stadium reconstruction.\n\n\"Given the results of the vote, we have a much more measured response, which is we want to look at our options,\" Donovan said. \"We went all in (on the April ballot) and failed pretty badly. What makes the most sense for our fans? What makes the most sense for our franchise? And what makes the most sense and can have the biggest impact on this region? The positive of this is we do have options.\n\n\"This is a generational decision. This is going to impact the future of this franchise for generations. We've got to get it right. We are going to take our time to do it right.\"\n\nIt'd be easy for the Chiefs to upgrade Arrowhead Stadium or move to a new facility entirely. The Hunt family, after all, is worth roughly $25 billion. Paying for construction would be well within its budget...if the family wanted to. And if a new building or enhanced existing building was such a strong investment with exceptional ROI, the Hunt family could and should pay for it.\n\nThat's now how modern stadium construction works though. The Kansas news gave the Chiefs a whole new option, one that Donovan was excited about.\n\n\"We feel like we're a pretty valuable (financial) asset to wherever we go,\" Donovan said. \"We think we've been really good partners to the state (of Missouri), the county (Jackson) and the city.\n\n\"We do believe that we're a unique asset that would bring something that (Kansas) has never had before. The messages that we've gotten from the leaders in Kansas, from those who have worked on star bond projects before, is that this is the most valuable opportunity they've ever had, so that's how we look at it.\"\n\nAgain though, if the Chiefs are so valuable, why not fund the construction project themselves? Because, of course, they don't have to. The only real decision now is whether taxpayers in Kansas or Missouri will be paying for it.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ian_miller@outkick.com", "name": "Ian Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landon_Donovan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landon Donovan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Donovan_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Donovan (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arrowhead Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sales tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Announcers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Announcers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Art_History/Online_Courses", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Art History/Online Courses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1923337205.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748016", "eventUri": "eng-9748016", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Here's what will determine their stadium future", "body": "As the Chiefs survey their options for a new -- or, ahem, renovated -- stadium, team president Mark Donovan on Friday made one thing clear:\n\nIt still might lead the Chiefs to the same destination.\n\nThe organization wants to finalize its future stadium plans within the next six months, Donovan said during a news conference at Missouri Western, the Chiefs' training camp home.\n\nWhat he didn't say: which home, which city, which county or which state they will seek to finalize those plans. You know, the part that has your curiosity most piqued.\n\nThose involved in ongoing discussions about the Chiefs' future home have flip-flopped their own predictions in conversations with The Star over the past several weeks, which is perhaps symbolic of the twist and turns after Jackson County voters rejected a sales tax that would have helped fund an Arrowhead Stadium renovation coupled with a Royals move to the Crossroads District.\n\nThe Chiefs are engaged in substantial conversations with political leadership in both Missouri and Kansas, the former only more recently -- which means that, yes, they are still strongly considering remaining at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nI've mentioned this once before, but the Chiefs have the atypical advantage of gaining leverage after having a vote that not only failed but failed quite convincingly. The options, after all, have swelled, and they've emerged publicly. What's better than that?\n\nWell, in that vein, let me interject some top-of-line context about each side of the state line: After the Kansas Legislature passed a plan to attempt to lure the Chiefs half an hour down the highway, the path in the state still has more challenges than people seem to want to realize; and in Missouri, no such path has even emerged, with legitimate questions about whether one will.\n\nThe latter is where, with only minimal between-the-lines reading required, it's evident the Chiefs are modifying the process of reaching a conclusion.\n\nWhat would another try at renovating Arrowhead Stadium entail?\n\nDonovan said Friday it would be \"difficult to really create a partnership\" on the Missouri side that does not include putting another vote before the public.\n\nWell, the more conversations I have about this, it's increasingly difficult for me to envision the Chiefs putting another vote before the public without accompanying support from the state and county.\n\nThree months ago, as Jackson County residents arrived at the ballot booths, the Chiefs had neither.\n\nFrank White, the Jackson County executive, campaigned against the question, arguing the county did not receive enough benefits from the measure. While the legislature would override his veto, the public sided with him. The Chiefs would not be eager -- or even willing, I might even say -- to put another measure in front of voters if that kind of opposition from public leadership exists, particularly when it might be absent elsewhere.\n\nWhich means part of the stay-at-Arrowhead-Stadium equation would require finding common ground with White. Those of us who reported extensively on the last try would share a dose of skepticism about such an agreement being made without a change of heart, tone or stance from one side, though the Chiefs have met with White since the April vote.\n\nBut it's not just about the county level. As I previously reported this summer, the Chiefs also had not sealed their potential state financial contributions before the April vote -- and offered the leverage of a potential Kansas option, they consider that vital to any future plans.\n\nGiven the makeup of the Missouri state legislature, which is subject to change after the elections this fall, some of that will be removed from the Chiefs' control.\n\nBut there are aspects within their control that can -- and should -- change, if they give it another try in Jackson County. Although the Royals were certainly not a help in pushing the measure across the finish line with voters -- and, if anything, the opposite -- the Chiefs' post-April analysis has illuminated some faults too.\n\nLike, this one: The Chiefs wouldn't fast-track this vote while saying, if not merely hoping, many of the financial and other details will come after its approval.\n\n\"We have committed that if we go to a public vote, we'll do it in a way which is much more final before we get to the vote,\" Donovan said. \"We'll have a lot of the facts; we'll have a lot of the details determined before we go.\"\n\nThe Chiefs would be open to a renovation plan, or potentially building new on the Truman Sports Complex site or at a different Missouri site, Donovan said, but let's not complicate it: A second attempt in Missouri would likely resemble the initial attempt.\n\nKind of.\n\nAlthough it would likely be a renovation plan, it wouldn't necessarily be the same renovation plan -- it's no secret that their rollout last spring did not exactly overwhelm the public.\n\n\"We have to acknowledge that did not go over as well as we thought it would,\" Donovan said. \"I want to be non-defensive here, but I also want to support my team -- I think if you really look at those renderings and what we had planned, it's a really exciting project. I think a lot of people went into that presentation (thinking), 'We're going to see a dome, and we're going to see this incredible retail facility around it.' And that's just not reality.\n\n\"But you have to acknowledge that didn't do it. That didn't really move the needle for people. So we'll look at that and figure out how we can better present it -- see if there's anything that we missed that we would do, or maybe do it in a different way.\"\n\nWhat about the Chiefs moving to Kansas?\n\nDuring a special session in June, Kansas legislators approved a bipartisan bill that permits the lawmakers to issue bonds to fund up to 70% of the estimated cost of a professional sports project.\n\nWhile Donovan said, \"it's amazing what Kansas did,\" he also acknowledged, \"I think both (states) are really complicated. I don't think there's a simple path on either side. There's a lot of work to be done in Kansas to see what the reality of that is.\"\n\nA project in Kansas -- the Chiefs are not to the stage of site-specific conversations there -- would require a new build, obviously, likely a domed stadium, which the Chiefs have estimated to cost $2.5 billion-$3 billion.\n\nThe Arrowhead Stadium renovations, by contrast, had an $800 million price tag, with the Hunt family ownership contributing $300 million. That left a $500 million gap.\n\nThe total price tag in Kansas is significantly larger, in other words, just as you'd expect it to be for a new stadium -- and therefore, even as the potential state contribution is larger, so is that gap in terms of pure dollar amount.\n\n\"I think if you look at the history of STAR bonds and the percentages, I don't think there's been a STAR bond project that has gotten the full percentage. So that's not our expectation,\" Donovan said.\n\nWhen I asked if the Hunt family would contribute more than $300 million to a new build in Kansas, Donovan added, \"If you look at the proposals and projects, you would have to put in more because it's going to cost more. ...\n\n\"If you're talking about a new domed stadium, you're at $2.5-3 billion. If STAR bonds is $1-1.5 billion, where's the other half coming from? So it quickly turns to, how are you going to finance it? We know that. As we get closer to that -- if we get closer to that -- that'll be one of the things we talk about. That's a significant commitment by the family.\"", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kansas City Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_mcdowell@kansascity.com", "name": "Sam McDowell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arrowhead Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landon_Donovan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landon Donovan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_County,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jackson County, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson County, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Donovan_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Donovan (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Western_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri Western State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sales tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missouri General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Sports_Complex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truman Sports Complex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/8czx6u/picture290017244/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/arrowhead%20stadium.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748016", "eventUri": "eng-9748016", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

JOSEPH, Mo. -- The Kansas City Chiefs went all-in and failed \"pretty badly\" as an April vote for a renovated Arrowhead Stadium fell flat, team president Mark Donovan said.\n\nNow, the Chiefs are continuing discussions with officials from both Kansas and Missouri to figure out the team's future location after their lease at Arrowhead expires following the 2030 season. Donovan said they're looking at the failed vote as an opportunity to consider what makes the most sense for fans and the future of the franchise.\n\n\"This is a generational decision,\" Donovan said. \"This is going to impact the future of this franchise for generations. We've got to get it right and we are going to do the due diligence.\"\n\nThe Chiefs and the Kansas City Royals went to voters in Jackson County, Missouri, in April hoping to extend an existing three-eighth-cent sales tax for two facilities: a renovated Arrowhead for the Chiefs and a new stadium for the Royals. The measure failed, with more than 58% of voters rejecting it.\n\nThat defeat led the Chiefs to broaden their search for a new plan. Donovan said the team staying in a renovated Arrowhead is \"very much an option\" and building a new stadium at the Arrowhead site is in play too.\n\n\"We have to look at a new building,\" Donovan said. \"We're open to it. We're open to a new building on the complex, we're open to a new building somewhere else. We're open to a dome or an outdoor [facility] as a new building. We're also very open to renovating GEHA Field at Arrowhead because I think it's iconic. It's something that's unique. We'd love to be able to do that.\n\n\"It's just going to come down to what makes the most sense and I want to reiterate the factors that go into that decision are what's best for our fans, what's best for the franchise for the next few decades.\"\n\nDonovan said the Chiefs have no firm deadline for a decision and will remain at Arrowhead, which opened in 1972 and was renovated almost 15 years ago, until 2030. But he acknowledged the team doesn't have long if it wants to be in a new facility or a renovated Arrowhead by 2031.\n\n\"Six months from today, we're going to have to have a really good idea of where we are,\" Donovan said. \"It may not be done done, but we need to have good idea.\"", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landon_Donovan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landon Donovan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Donovan_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Donovan (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arrowhead Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sales tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_County,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackson County, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson County, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEHA", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GEHA"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Design_and_Construction", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Design and Construction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://ktbb.com/post/wp-content/media/2022/12/facebook-og-1200630.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748016", "eventUri": "eng-9748016", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

JOSEPH, Mo. -- The Chiefs have set a deadline of six months from now to decide on a plan for the future of Arrowhead Stadium, whether that means renovating their iconic home or building an entirely new stadium in Kansas or Missouri.\n\nAfter a joint ballot initiative with the Royals to help fund facilities by extending a sales tax was rejected by voters in Jackson County, Missouri, earlier this year, the teams agreed to move forward with separate plans. Now, they are waiting for the leaders in both states that comprise the Kansas City metro to put forward their best pitches.\n\nLegislators in Kansas approved a plan last month that would finance up to 70% of the cost of new stadiums for pro sports franchises with an eye on luring the Chiefs across the state line. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson responded a week later by saying he expects his state to put together an aid plan by the end of the year to keep the teams on its side of the metro.\n\nPeople are also reading...

This is going to impact the future of this franchise for generations,\" Chiefs president Mark Donovan said Friday, the day that veterans reported to training camp at Missouri Western in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\n\"We have to get this right,\" Donovan said. \"We are going to do the due-diligence. We are going to take our time and do it right. But there is a reality to the timing. You can only take so much time to get it right. And that window is starting to close.\"\n\nThe Chiefs and Royals have played for more than five decades at the Truman Sports Complex, where a lease agreement calls for the use of a sales tax for their upkeep. And while Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium remain beloved by fans, the reality is both are becoming outdated, and it's unclear how long they would last even if they were renovated again.\n\nRoyals owner John Sherman has said his team will not play at Kauffman beyond the 2030 season, preferring instead to build a new downtown ballpark. The Chiefs initially hoped to renovate Arrowhead but are becoming more open to building new.\n\nChiefs owner Clark Hunt has long hoped to host a Super Bowl, and that would be more likely with a new stadium. If it included a retractable roof, the stadium also could land lucrative events such as the Final Four and college football playoff games.\n\nOne factor working against Missouri is its uncertain political environment. Parson cannot run for reelection due to term limits, and that means the Chiefs must wait until later this fall to know who they would be working with going forward.\n\nChiefs' vets report: The veterans have arrived at training camp for the Kansas City Chiefs. But given that Travis Kelce and Co. have proven what they can do, helping the Chiefs with a third Super Bowl in five years last season, their biggest responsibility might be ushering along a bunch of rookies that have been working for a few days already. Guys such as wide receiver Xavier Worthy, their first-round pick out of Texas, and left tackle Kingsley Suamataia, their second-rounder out of BYU, have a legitimate chance to earn a starting job for the defending champions.\n\nBears' Williams ready for spotlight\n\nLAKE FOREST, Ill. -- Caleb Williams is ready for what comes next.\n\nThe No. 1 overall draft pick and 2022 Heisman Trophy winner is embracing the spotlight in Chicago after playing a starring role in Hollywood as the quarterback at USC. All eyes will be on him when the Bears begin training camp Saturday.\n\n\"I've kind of put myself in this position many times before I became a Chicago Bear on the 25th of April,\" Williams said Friday.\n\nThe Bears are banking on Williams to give them a big lift and solidify a position that has historically been a sore spot for the founding NFL franchise. But he's also in a rather rare situation for a No. 1 pick, joining a team that's one of the league's shiny objects at the moment.\n\nThe Bears made several big moves to boost their offense and have their sights set on making the playoffs, something they've done just three times since the 2006 Super Bowl season. They're also trying to secure funding to build an enclosed lakefront stadium, though they could turn their attention back to a tract of land they own in suburban Arlington Heights, Illinois, if a deal doesn't go through. With all those storylines, they'll have HBO's \"Hard Knocks\" cameras following them during camp.\n\nThere's quite a buzz for a team with a 10-24 record in two seasons under general manager Ryan Poles and coach Matt Eberflus.

JOSEPH, Mo. -- The Chiefs have set a deadline of six months from now to decide on a plan for the future of Arrowhead Stadium, whether that means renovating their iconic home or building an entirely new stadium in Kansas or Missouri.\n\nAfter a joint ballot initiative with the Royals to help fund facilities by extending a sales tax was rejected by voters in Jackson County, Missouri, earlier this year, the teams agreed to move forward with separate plans. Now, they are waiting for the leaders in both states that comprise the Kansas City metro to put forward their best pitches.\n\nLegislators in Kansas approved a plan last month that would finance up to 70% of the cost of new stadiums for pro sports franchises with an eye on luring the Chiefs across the state line. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson responded a week later by saying he expects his state to put together an aid plan by the end of the year to keep the teams on its side of the metro.\n\nPeople are also reading...

This is going to impact the future of this franchise for generations,\" Chiefs president Mark Donovan said Friday, the day that veterans reported to training camp at Missouri Western in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\n\"We have to get this right,\" Donovan said. \"We are going to do the due-diligence. We are going to take our time and do it right. But there is a reality to the timing. You can only take so much time to get it right. And that window is starting to close.\"\n\nThe Chiefs and Royals have played for more than five decades at the Truman Sports Complex, where a lease agreement calls for the use of a sales tax for their upkeep. And while Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium remain beloved by fans, the reality is both are becoming outdated, and it's unclear how long they would last even if they were renovated again.\n\nRoyals owner John Sherman has said his team will not play at Kauffman beyond the 2030 season, preferring instead to build a new downtown ballpark. The Chiefs initially hoped to renovate Arrowhead but are becoming more open to building new.\n\nChiefs owner Clark Hunt has long hoped to host a Super Bowl, and that would be more likely with a new stadium. If it included a retractable roof, the stadium also could land lucrative events such as the Final Four and college football playoff games.\n\nOne factor working against Missouri is its uncertain political environment. Parson cannot run for reelection due to term limits, and that means the Chiefs must wait until later this fall to know who they would be working with going forward.\n\nChiefs' vets report: The veterans have arrived at training camp for the Kansas City Chiefs. But given that Travis Kelce and Co. have proven what they can do, helping the Chiefs with a third Super Bowl in five years last season, their biggest responsibility might be ushering along a bunch of rookies that have been working for a few days already. Guys such as wide receiver Xavier Worthy, their first-round pick out of Texas, and left tackle Kingsley Suamataia, their second-rounder out of BYU, have a legitimate chance to earn a starting job for the defending champions.\n\nBears' Williams ready for spotlight\n\nLAKE FOREST, Ill. -- Caleb Williams is ready for what comes next.\n\nThe No. 1 overall draft pick and 2022 Heisman Trophy winner is embracing the spotlight in Chicago after playing a starring role in Hollywood as the quarterback at USC. All eyes will be on him when the Bears begin training camp Saturday.\n\n\"I've kind of put myself in this position many times before I became a Chicago Bear on the 25th of April,\" Williams said Friday.\n\nThe Bears are banking on Williams to give them a big lift and solidify a position that has historically been a sore spot for the founding NFL franchise. But he's also in a rather rare situation for a No. 1 pick, joining a team that's one of the league's shiny objects at the moment.\n\nThe Bears made several big moves to boost their offense and have their sights set on making the playoffs, something they've done just three times since the 2006 Super Bowl season. They're also trying to secure funding to build an enclosed lakefront stadium, though they could turn their attention back to a tract of land they own in suburban Arlington Heights, Illinois, if a deal doesn't go through. With all those storylines, they'll have HBO's \"Hard Knocks\" cameras following them during camp.\n\nThere's quite a buzz for a team with a 10-24 record in two seasons under general manager Ryan Poles and coach Matt Eberflus. But after going 7-10 last season, the Bears have their sights set higher.\n\nBRIEFLY\n\nJAGUARS: Jacksonville filed a lawsuit against a former employee who is serving prison time after pleading guilty to stealing $22 million from the NFL team's virtual credit card program. The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Duval County Circuit Court, seeks more than $66 million in damages, or three times the amount Amit Patel admitted stealing to feed a gambling addiction and a lavish lifestyle.\n\nRAVENS: Baltimore has agreed to a one-year deal with former Chicago Bears safety Eddie Jackson. The Ravens announced the deal Friday, two days before they start training camp.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that

JOSEPH, Mo. -- The Chiefs have set a deadline of six months from now to decide on a plan for the future of Arrowhead Stadium, whether that means renovating their iconic home or building an entirely new stadium in Kansas or Missouri.\n\nAfter a joint ballot initiative with the Royals to help fund facilities by extending a sales tax was rejected by voters in Jackson County, Missouri, earlier this year, the teams agreed to move forward with separate plans. Now, they are waiting for the leaders in both states that comprise the Kansas City metro to put forward their best pitches.\n\nLegislators in Kansas approved a plan last month that would finance up to 70% of the cost of new stadiums for pro sports franchises with an eye on luring the Chiefs across the state line. Missouri Gov.

In the meantime, there's one thing that everyone can count on.\n\n\"It's important for everybody to understand,\" said Donovan, \"that we are playing Kansas City Chiefs football home games -- if [they're] not international games -- at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium through 2031. That is our plan; that is what we're doing.\"\n\nAfter that, however, the picture gets much cloudier. After Kansas lawmakers passed their modified STAR bond proposal that would make it possible for the Chiefs (and possibly the Kansas City Royals) to build new stadiums on the other side of the state line, many fans (and media observers) concluded it was obvious the team would make that move -- just because it would be easier to build a new, modern facility.\n\nBut Donovan isn't convinced it's that obvious.\n\n\"I don't think there's a simple path on either side,\" he insisted. \"There's a lot of work to be done on Kansas to see what the reality of that is. We don't take that for granted.\n\n\"It was amazing what Kansas did. It was good to see. We really appreciate the leadership [from] Ty Masterson, Dan Hawkins, the various people [and] the governor in putting that together. That's the first step.\n\n\"[But] once you get through that, it gets really complicated in how you do that. For us, the good news is that it creates more options.\"\n\nDonovan acknowledged that the team is engaged in stadium discussions with Kansas officials. But the team isn't yet giving up on staying home.\n\n\"We continue our discussions with the folks in Missouri,\" he said. \"Talking to various leaders, there seem to be other options that are coming up now on the Missouri side. So we appreciate that -- and it's consistent with our strategy: if [the April proposal didn't work], which was our plan, then we've got to look at options. And now we'll have a couple of options to look at.\"\n\nDonovan believes that any Missouri solution would eventually come to a public vote. But until that state's primary elections happen in early August, it will be difficult for state (or county) officials to estimate 2025's political landscape. That would significantly shape any proposal that would come to a vote in... say... November.\n\nIf there is another Missouri vote, Donovan says the proposal will only include the Chiefs -- and voters will have a clearer picture of what is on the table.\n\n\"We have committed that if we go to a public vote, we'll do it in a way which is much more 'final' before we get to the vote,\" he promised. \"We'll have a lot of the facts. We'll have a lot of the details determined before we go. I think it's important to acknowledge that we'd have to have agreements on the county side -- and have support, frankly, from the county.\"\n\nHow soon will we know the team's plans? That's very hard to calculate.\n\n\"We have to have somewhere to play our games for the 2031 season,\" explained Donovan. \"In order to do that, you've got to back up from there. When do you start planning? When do you start building? How do you renovate -- or build new? If you're renovating it, how are you doing it over seasons while you're still playing there? A lot of those factors play into that.\n\n\"That goes back to the option point. We need to have options, we need to have those options to a point of definition to be able to make a decision. So that's the process we're in right now.\"\n\nSo when will that decision point be upon us?\n\n\"I think six months from today, we're going to have a really good idea of where we are,\" said Donovan. \"We may not be done, but we need to have a really good idea.\n\n\"When you're building a new stadium, there's a lot more lead time than when you're renovating. So that's why that timeline is a little bit longer -- and will push us a little bit faster to make a decision. That timeline kind of plays into the Missouri timeline as well. So if we're on that timeline, we need to make a decision -- so Missouri sort of needs to play to that timeline.\"", "source": {"uri": "arrowheadpride.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arrowhead Pride"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_dixon@arrowheadpride.com", "name": "John Dixon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landon_Donovan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landon Donovan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arrowhead Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Western_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri Western State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Masterson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ty Masterson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hawkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hawkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vuXK3CryYIZbl7MatD3bg9rfLNo=/186x221:3841x2049/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25538537/1367720449.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748016", "eventUri": "eng-9748016", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

JOSEPH, Mo. -- The Chiefs have set a deadline of six months from now to decide on a plan for the future of Arrowhead Stadium, whether that means renovating their iconic home or building an entirely new stadium in Kansas or Missouri.\n\nAfter a joint ballot initiative with the Royals to help fund facilities by extending a sales tax was rejected by voters in Jackson County, Missouri, earlier this year, the teams agreed to move forward with separate plans. Now, they are waiting for the leaders in both states that comprise the Kansas City metro to put forward their best pitches.\n\nLegislators in Kansas approved a plan last month that would finance up to 70% of the cost of new stadiums for pro sports franchises with an eye on luring the Chiefs across the state line. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson responded a week later by saying he expects his state to put together an aid plan by the end of the year to keep the teams on its side of the metro.\n\nPeople are also reading...

This is going to impact the future of this franchise for generations,\" Chiefs president Mark Donovan said Friday, the day that veterans reported to training camp at Missouri Western in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\n\"We have to get this right,\" Donovan said. \"We are going to do the due-diligence. We are going to take our time and do it right. But there is a reality to the timing. You can only take so much time to get it right. And that window is starting to close.\"\n\nThe Chiefs and Royals have played for more than five decades at the Truman Sports Complex, where a lease agreement calls for the use of a sales tax for their upkeep. And while Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium remain beloved by fans, the reality is both are becoming outdated, and it's unclear how long they would last even if they were renovated again.\n\nRoyals owner John Sherman has said his team will not play at Kauffman beyond the 2030 season, preferring instead to build a new downtown ballpark. The Chiefs initially hoped to renovate Arrowhead but are becoming more open to building new.\n\nChiefs owner Clark Hunt has long hoped to host a Super Bowl, and that would be more likely with a new stadium. If it included a retractable roof, the stadium also could land lucrative events such as the Final Four and college football playoff games.\n\nOne factor working against Missouri is its uncertain political environment. Parson cannot run for reelection due to term limits, and that means the Chiefs must wait until later this fall to know who they would be working with going forward.\n\nChiefs' vets report: The veterans have arrived at training camp for the Kansas City Chiefs. But given that Travis Kelce and Co. have proven what they can do, helping the Chiefs with a third Super Bowl in five years last season, their biggest responsibility might be ushering along a bunch of rookies that have been working for a few days already. Guys such as wide receiver Xavier Worthy, their first-round pick out of Texas, and left tackle Kingsley Suamataia, their second-rounder out of BYU, have a legitimate chance to earn a starting job for the defending champions.\n\nBears' Williams ready for spotlight\n\nLAKE FOREST, Ill. -- Caleb Williams is ready for what comes next.\n\nThe No. 1 overall draft pick and 2022 Heisman Trophy winner is embracing the spotlight in Chicago after playing a starring role in Hollywood as the quarterback at USC. All eyes will be on him when the Bears begin training camp Saturday.\n\n\"I've kind of put myself in this position many times before I became a Chicago Bear on the 25th of April,\" Williams said Friday.\n\nThe Bears are banking on Williams to give them a big lift and solidify a position that has historically been a sore spot for the founding NFL franchise. But he's also in a rather rare situation for a No. 1 pick, joining a team that's one of the league's shiny objects at the moment.\n\nThe Bears made several big moves to boost their offense and have their sights set on making the playoffs, something they've done just three times since the 2006 Super Bowl season. They're also trying to secure funding to build an enclosed lakefront stadium, though they could turn their attention back to a tract of land they own in suburban Arlington Heights, Illinois, if a deal doesn't go through. With all those storylines, they'll have HBO's \"Hard Knocks\" cameras following them during camp.\n\nThere's quite a buzz for a team with a 10-24 record in two seasons under general manager Ryan Poles and coach Matt Eberflus. But after going 7-10 last season, the Bears have their sights set higher.\n\nBRIEFLY\n\nJAGUARS: Jacksonville filed a lawsuit against a former employee who is serving prison time after pleading guilty to stealing $22 million from the NFL team's virtual credit card program. The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Duval County Circuit Court, seeks more than $66 million in damages, or three times the amount Amit Patel admitted stealing to feed a gambling addiction and a lavish lifestyle.\n\nRAVENS: Baltimore has agreed to a one-year deal with former Chicago Bears safety Eddie Jackson. The Ravens announced the deal Friday, two days before they start training camp.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I

QB PATRICK MAHOMES, KANSAS CITY CHIEFS\n\nMahomes is once again the best player in the NFL, and now that Aaron Donald has retired, it's really no longer a question. The Chiefs are back-to-back champions under Mahomes' leadership after he was once more able to elevate his game in the postseason. His 91.7 PFF overall grade across four playoff games was a notable and necessary jump from the 85.1 he recorded during the regular season. We are watching one of the best to ever do it, and the only thing left to determine his spot on the all-time list is for how long we will be lucky enough to witness it.\n\n2025 NFL Mock Draft: Way-Too-Early Best Team Fits for Travis Hunter, Top Prospects | Bleacher Report\n\n30. Kansas City Chiefs: OL Earnest Greene III, Georgia\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs already started to prepare for what may be the inevitable. Both center Creed Humphrey and right guard Trey Smith are set to become free agents after the 2024 season. Each could easily reset their respective positional markets.\n\nDuring this year's draft, the Chiefs drafted three offensive linemen. The second-round selection of Kingsley Suamataia is a long-term play at left tackle. Hunter Nourzad is insurance at center. Finally, C.J. Hanson was a small-school tackle prospect who'll provide depth and compete at guard.\n\nGeorgia's Earnest Greene III covers a lot of bases. He's the Bulldogs' starting left tackle. He earned a nod on the first-team All-SEC Freshman squad. But he's often projected inside because of his (listed) 6'4\", 320-pound frame.\n\nWhether at tackle or guard, Greene will benefit the Chiefs' front five.\n\nOther Fits: WR Isaiah Bond, Texas; Edge Landon Jackson, Arkansas; RB Ollie Gordon II, Oklahoma State\n\nState of the Kansas City Chiefs: Patrick Mahomes & Co. to author unprecedented Super Bowl three-peat? | NFL.com\n\nMy HOTTEST Chiefs fantasy take:\n\nIs Xavier truly Worthy in Year 1?\n\nWe already talked about Kansas City's first-round pick. And I undersand why many in the fantasy realm view him as an instant-impact type: He's absurdly fast and he'll be catching balls from Patrick Mahomes. All good. But it could take the 165-pounder a little time to transition to the pro game. And he had some drop issues in college. I'm just not sure about the week-to-week consistency in 2024. To me, this offense will funnel through Travis Kelce, Isiah Pacheco and Hollywood Brown.\n\nRanking NFL's Top 25 Players Under Age 25 Before 2024 Season | Bleacher Report\n\n13. Kansas City Chiefs CB Trent McDuffie (23) -- Same deal here, except McDuffie exploded in his second season. He's already become a major playmaker, but he'll have to do it again and can become a little more consistent in coverage.\n\n2024 NFL training camp: Every team's top position battle to watch | Chiefs Wire\n\nKansas City Chiefs: No. 2 Tight end\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs didn't need to target a tight end in the 2024 NFL draft, but chose to select TCU product Jared Wiley to bolster their depth at the position anyway. Though Travis Kelce is likely to remain the Chiefs' starting tight end until he decides to retire, his backups have traditionally played an important role in Andy Reid's offense. The addition of Irv Smith Jr. in free agency signaled that Kansas City was open to competition behind Kelce, and with 2021 fifth-round pick Noah Gray still on their payroll, the Chiefs are suddenly stacked at tight end. - John Dillon, Chiefs Wire\n\nAround the NFL\n\nKenyan Drake announces his retirement | NBC Sports\n\nDrake announced his retirement as a player in an Instagram post on Friday. Drake played in games for the Packers and Ravens last season, but has not been with any team this year.\n\n\"It's been an incredible ride,\" Drake wrote. \"Hard to believe eight seasons have come and gone. I've loved the journey -- the wins, the moments big and small, the comradery, the energy, all of it. I can't say I loved everything (if you've ever done training camp in Miami you can relate lol), but certainly appreciate the lows and the grind, and know those moments grew me as a football player and more importantly as a person. Ready to enjoy a little retirement and see where the next chapter takes me. Thanks to everyone that was along for the ride with me - wouldn't change a thing.\"\n\nNo. 10 overall pick J.J. McCarthy inking rookie deal with Vikings | NFL.com\n\nOnly two remaining first-round selections are unsigned: McCarthy's new teammate, No. 17 overall pick Dallas Turner, and No. 18 selection Amarius Mims of the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nMcCarthy compiled a wildly successful collegiate career at Michigan, posting a 27-1 record in two seasons spent as a full-time starter for the Wolverines, including two wins over rival Ohio State, two College Football Playoff appearances, and a career-closing national title game triumph over Washington. He's entering camp penciled in as the backup behind veteran Sam Darnold, but is expected to take over before long as the Vikings' planned successor to Kirk Cousins.\n\nIn case you missed it on Arrowhead Pride\n\nChiefs News: KC says 'high-bar' design could push alternate uniforms\n\nThe league first approved a measure to allow for alternate helmets in 2021 -- and this past offseason, it expanded its stance to include a third helmet design.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs have yet to take advantage of either measure, sticking with the mirrored \"KC Arrowhead\" on a red helmet with a white mask. Alternate uniforms and helmets have never been a priority for owner, chairman and CEO Clark Hunt. He likes the fact that his team's look honors the deep-rooted tradition of the franchise.\n\n\"I think the second or third year, I brought it up, and it was a swift, 'No,'\" smiled Chiefs president Mark Donovan on Friday, \"so I sort of tabled it. We brought it up again three years ago, and it wasn't such a swift, 'No.' It was like, 'OK, we can probably talk about it.'\"\n\nIn 2009, the Chiefs paid tribute to their franchise's first name with throwback \"Dallas Texans\" uniforms when they played the Dallas Cowboys. Still, while the conversation may be coming up a little more than it used to, it sounds like the team is maintaining the same perspective it always has.\n\n\"[We're] pretty focused on the position that we have,\" said Donovan. \"I think we're one of, if not the only [team] with the traditional, haven't changed it, don't have an alternative. We like that. Our players really like our all white-on-white [uniforms], even more so than red-on-red now. So that's become sort of our go-to. But we'll always consider it.\"", "source": {"uri": "arrowheadpride.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arrowhead Pride"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_childs@arrowheadpride.com", "name": "Tom Childs",

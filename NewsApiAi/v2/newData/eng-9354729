Here's all that we need to know:\n\nA penumbral lunar eclipse happens when the earth, sun and the moon are completely aligned. Then, the earth's shadow may prevent the sun's light from reaching the moon, thereby covering the moon completely or a part of the moon with its shadow.\n\nThe lunar eclipse will start at 10:23AM and will end at 3:02OM on March 25. However, it will not be visible in India. According to tradition, sutak period is observed for the time when the lunar eclipse happens. Hence, all kinds of auspicious activities are prohibited during the sutak period. However, since it will not be visible in india, there will not be any sutak period.\n\nThe lunar eclipse will be visible in parts of Ireland, Belgium, Spain, England, South Norway, Italy, Portugal, Russia, Germany, the United States, Japan, Switzerland, Netherlands and France.\n\nAs the date of the lunar eclipse is clashing with the Holi celebrations, people are worried if the sutak period will affect the rituals. However, the good news is, it will not. Since, it will not be visible in India, there is no need of observing the sutak period.

Here's where and how to watch April's upcoming show", "body": "On April 8, the moon's shadow will glide across Mexico, into the United States and finally into Canada, producing one of nature's greatest spectacles: A total solar eclipse.\n\nBut if you want to see it, you'll likely have to travel to eastern Canada -- and into a very narrow path that stretches from southern Ontario, through Quebec into New Brunswick, P.E.I. and Newfoundland. (In Nova Scotia, only the Meat Cove area will experience totality.)\n\nTotal solar eclipses occur when the moon passes in front of the sun, blocking out its light. The path of that shadow is extremely narrow, which is why most people have likely never seen one.\n\n\"People ... think that solar eclipses are extremely, extremely rare,\" said Fred Espenak, a retired NASA astronomer and the agency's lead eclipse expert. \"The rare part of of total solar eclipses is that they're only visible from a very small fraction of the Earth's surface, typically less than about one-half per cent of the Earth's surface for a given total solar eclipse.\"\n\nGiven that, the average for any one spot on Earth to see a total eclipse is about once every 375 years, he explained. And that's why most people haven't experienced a total solar eclipse.\n\nHowever, many people have likely experienced a partial solar eclipse, where it looks like something has taken a bite out of the sun. That's because the visibility of those is far wider. For next month's eclipse, outside of that narrow path of totality, the rest of the country will experience a partial eclipse in some form.\n\nBut seasoned eclipse chasers say there's a very big difference between a partial and a total solar eclipse.\n\nEspenak, who has seen 24 total solar eclipses, said a partial eclipse is lovely, but there's nothing like a total.\n\n\"People have to understand that even if someone may have seen a partial eclipse, they think that's the whole thing. It's just a degree of a percentage,\" he said. \"They saw a 50 per cent partial or an 80 per cent partial -- that 80 per cent is as good as a total. Well, it's not.\n\n\"Seeing a partial eclipse is like getting five out of the six numbers in the Powerball. To win the jackpot, you've got to get all six numbers. And to win the jackpot with eclipses, you've got to be 100 per cent.\"\n\nA 'spiritual' experience\n\nJay Anderson, a former meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada and an avid eclipse chaser, said the experience of standing in the moon's shadow is unforgettable.\n\n\"The eclipse itself is the marvel: the prominences, chromosphere, the corona, all of which are parts of the solar atmosphere that suddenly pop into view that average person wouldn't see.\n\nThe diamond-ring effect of 2017's total solar eclipse, seen from Salem, Ore. (AP Photo/Don Ryan)\n\n\"And the temperature drops and the shadow comes in,\" he said, \"and you're looking up at the sun and you're watching that last little bead [of light] squeeze off, and you get the diamond ring, and -- whomp -- you're into that darkness. But you're seeing the corona appearing before the sun is completely covered.\n\n\"Then when it's over, there's a lot of hugging and shouting, and a few tears and marriage proposals sometimes.\"\n\nEspenak feels the same way. \"For some people, it's almost a spiritual experience,\" he said. \"It's a humbling experience, in my opinion. It gives you a sense of of man's place in the universe. And you realize just how small and inconspicuous we really are, and insignificant.\"\n\nSafety first\n\nIt's why Espenak is also frustrated with some school boards opting to make April 8 a P.A. day, or keep the children indoors.\n\nThe Toronto District School Board, for one, cited safety concerns, as the eclipse would fall around the end of the school day, when students and staff would be heading home.\n\n\"Getting the chance to see a total eclipse is such an incredible educational opportunity that I think it's criminal negligence to lock kids up in schools,\" he said.\n\nHe acknowledged that it takes some preparation, but he said it could have provided for a good learning experience leading up to the event -- teaching children about how and why eclipses happen, proper safety practices and more.\n\nA young spectator looks skyward during a partial eclipse of the sun on August 21, 2017 at the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Garden City, New York. (Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)\n\n\"Seeing something like this could could inspire some hidden passion for studying the sciences. It doesn't have to be astronomy, but just experiencing something beautiful in the natural world.\"\n\nEye safety is of the utmost importance, whether you're in the path of totality or will see the partial eclipse. The best and easiest way to protect your eyes is to purchase eclipse glasses, which are widely available from astronomical organizations, science centres and online astronomy stores.\n\nIt's important to ensure they are ISO-compliant, with ISO 12312-2. Try to avoid purchasing elsewhere, as in 2017, there were many fakes that still contained the ISO number. Looking directly at the sun without protection could permanently damage your eyes.\n\nWATCH | A solar eclipse can cook your eyes: How to watch safely\n\nThe only time it is safe to take off your eclipse glasses is when the moon has totally covered the sun. All other times, you must wear eclipse glasses. The only caveat is that people should already have them or should order them soon, as places are beginning to sell out.\n\nAnderson -- who's also seen 24 total solar eclipses -- and Espenak both feel that once someone experiences a total solar eclipse, it will just feed their desire to see more of them.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

Here's where and how to watch April's upcoming show | CBC News", "body": "On April 8, the moon's shadow will glide across Mexico, into the United States and finally into Canada, producing one of nature's greatest spectacles: A total solar eclipse.\n\nBut if you want to see it, you'll likely have to travel to eastern Canada -- and into a very narrow path that stretches from southern Ontario, through Quebec into New Brunswick, P.E.I. and Newfoundland. (In Nova Scotia, only the Meat Cove area will experience totality.)\n\nTotal solar eclipses occur when the moon passes in front of the sun, blocking out its light. The path of that shadow is extremely narrow, which is why most people have likely never seen one.\n\n\"People ... think that solar eclipses are extremely, extremely rare,\" said Fred Espenak, a retired NASA astronomer and the agency's lead eclipse expert. \"The rare part of of total solar eclipses is that they're only visible from a very small fraction of the Earth's surface, typically less than about one-half per cent of the Earth's surface for a given total solar eclipse.\"\n\nGiven that, the average for any one spot on Earth to see a total eclipse is about once every 375 years, he explained. And that's why most people haven't experienced a total solar eclipse.\n\nHowever, many people have likely experienced a partial solar eclipse, where it looks like something has taken a bite out of the sun. That's because the visibility of those is far wider. For next month's eclipse, outside of that narrow path of totality, the rest of the country will experience a partial eclipse in some form.\n\nBut seasoned eclipse chasers say there's a very big difference between a partial and a total solar eclipse.\n\nEspenak, who has seen 24 total solar eclipses, said a partial eclipse is lovely, but there's nothing like a total.\n\n\"People have to understand that even if someone may have seen a partial eclipse, they think that's the whole thing. It's just a degree of a percentage,\" he said. \"They saw a 50 per cent partial or an 80 per cent partial -- that 80 per cent is as good as a total. Well, it's not.\n\n\"Seeing a partial eclipse is like getting five out of the six numbers in the Powerball. To win the jackpot, you've got to get all six numbers. And to win the jackpot with eclipses, you've got to be 100 per cent.\"\n\nJay Anderson, a former meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada and an avid eclipse chaser, said the experience of standing in the moon's shadow is unforgettable.\n\n\"The eclipse itself is the marvel: the prominences, chromosphere, the corona, all of which are parts of the solar atmosphere that suddenly pop into view that average person wouldn't see.\n\n\"And the temperature drops and the shadow comes in,\" he said, \"and you're looking up at the sun and you're watching that last little bead [of light] squeeze off, and you get the diamond ring, and -- whomp -- you're into that darkness. But you're seeing the corona appearing before the sun is completely covered.\n\n\"Then when it's over, there's a lot of hugging and shouting, and a few tears and marriage proposals sometimes.\"\n\nEspenak feels the same way. \"For some people, it's almost a spiritual experience,\" he said. \"It's a humbling experience, in my opinion. It gives you a sense of of man's place in the universe. And you realize just how small and inconspicuous we really are, and insignificant.\"\n\nIt's why Espenak is also frustrated with some school boards opting to make April 8 a P.A. day, or keep the children indoors.\n\nThe Toronto District School Board, for one, cited safety concerns, as the eclipse would fall around the end of the school day, when students and staff would be heading home.\n\n\"Getting the chance to see a total eclipse is such an incredible educational opportunity that I think it's criminal negligence to lock kids up in schools,\" he said.\n\nHe acknowledged that it takes some preparation, but he said it could have provided for a good learning experience leading up to the event -- teaching children about how and why eclipses happen, proper safety practices and more.\n\n\"Seeing something like this could could inspire some hidden passion for studying the sciences. It doesn't have to be astronomy, but just experiencing something beautiful in the natural world.\"\n\nEye safety is of the utmost importance, whether you're in the path of totality or will see the partial eclipse. The best and easiest way to protect your eyes is to purchase eclipse glasses, which are widely available from astronomical organizations, science centres and online astronomy stores.\n\nIt's important to ensure they are ISO-compliant, with ISO 12312-2. Try to avoid purchasing elsewhere, as in 2017, there were many fakes that still contained the ISO number. Looking directly at the sun without protection could permanently damage your eyes.\n\nThe only time it is safe to take off your eclipse glasses is when the moon has totally covered the sun. All other times, you must wear eclipse glasses. The only caveat is that people should already have them or should order them soon, as places are beginning to sell out.\n\nAnderson -- who's also seen 24 total solar eclipses -- and Espenak both feel that once someone experiences a total solar eclipse, it will just feed their desire to see more of them.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [],

The sheer thrill of seeing the moon's shadow pass over the Earth as it comes between the planet and the Sun is something that eclipse chasers cannot miss. As 8 April marks the first total solar eclipse of 2024, let us know more about this stunning cosmological and where it will be visible.\n\nThis time, several factors are at play that can account for a larger viewing base. The path of totality will be around 185 km (115 miles) wide, allowing more people to experience the event. The moon will be 3,59,515 km away from the Earth, implying its conical shadow on the planet will have a larger diameter, states Space.com.\n\nBefore diving into the details of the 2024 total solar eclipse, let us understand the different types of solar eclipses and what makes a total eclipse so important.\n\nNASA states there are four types of solar eclipses. Besides a total eclipse, there are hybrid, annular and partial, each named according to how the Moon passes between the planet and the brightest star in the solar system. This is significant because the satellite doesn't orbit on the same plane as the Sun and Earth. Therefore, the occasional alignment, which happens just about twice a year, is termed eclipse season.\n\nIn an annular eclipse, the Moon is at perihelion, or its farthest point from the Earth. As a result, skygazers here will only see the celestial body appear as a smaller disk on the fiery orb, giving the impression of a ring around the Moon. A cross between a total and an annular eclipse is the hybrid eclipse. Owing to the curved surface of the Earth, observers along the eclipse's path might see a switch between total and annular eclipse, giving rise to a hybrid eclipse.\n\nA partial solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and the Earth, but the three bodies are not perfectly aligned. Hence, only a small fragment of the Sun gets covered during partial solar eclipses, casting a mild shadow on the Earth.\n\nThis brings us to the fact that it is only during a total solar eclipse that the astronomical phenomenon reaches its peak and is the most vividly visible. It is also the only time observers can remove their eclipse glasses as the Moon completely blocks the Sun. If the weather permits on eclipse day, one can also see the Sun's corona or its outer atmosphere, which usually remains hidden due to its bright illumination.\n\nThe diamond-ring formation is another highly anticipated part of total solar eclipses. It occurs when the totality begins and ends, and only a small portion of sunlight peaks out.\n\nThe total solar eclipse of 2024 will follow a southwest-to-northeast trajectory as the path of totality crosses Mexico, the continental United States and a small chunk of eastern Canada. If clear skies prevail, 14 to 15 US states will be able to catch a glimpse of the event. According to NASA, Mexico's Pacific coast is the first location to see the totality phase at around 11:07 am PDT (around 11:37 pm IST).\n\nThe path of totality will then enter the US in Texas and traverse through Oklahoma, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, New Hampshire and Maine. Other US states are expected to see a partial eclipse where only a small portion of the Sun will be bitten off by the Moon.\n\nCrossing the borders, the total solar eclipse will enter Canada in Southern Ontario before passing over Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Cape Breton. It will finally cross North America and exit onto the Atlantic Ocean from Canada's Newfoundland at around 5:16 pm NDT (around 1:16 am on 9 April IST).\n\nSuch a long solar eclipse is extremely rare, and considering it encompasses a wider path of totality -- with over 150 million people observing a partial solar eclipse -- this is an exceptional astronomical feat. Space.com states the Sun will be under the Moon's shadow for a solid 4 minutes and 28 seconds, ensuring ample time for keen skygazers to observe the event.\n\nDuring this time, the sky will become dark as if it was dawn or dusk. Some nocturnal wildlife might be triggered to wake up thinking it is dark. It is best to be under an open sky with fewer trees, buildings and little artificial lighting for the best viewing experience.\n\nThe total solar eclipse on 8 April 2024 will not be visible from India. In fact, none of the four eclipses of the year will be visible from the Indian subcontinent. Therefore, people are urged not to panic or carry out any rituals related to the solar eclipse.\n\nIt is imperative to take proper safety measures while watching a solar eclipse. \"Viewing any part of the bright Sun through a camera lens, binoculars, or a telescope without a special-purpose solar filter secured over the front of the optics will instantly cause severe eye injury,\" states NASA.\n\nOne can only remove eclipse glasses during the phase of totality when the Moon completely blocks the Sun.\n\nThere is an annular solar eclipse on 2 October 2024. It is expected to be visible from southern North America, South America and Antarctica.\n\nAfter this, the next total solar eclipse will occur on 12 August 2026, with the totality visible from Greenland, Iceland, the Atlantic Ocean and Spain.\n\n(Hero and feature image: Courtesy Justin Dickey/ @justinmdickey/ Unsplash)\n\n-Where is the best place to see the 2024 total solar eclipse?\n\nUS states like Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, New Hampshire and Maine have the best view of the 2024 total solar eclipse on 8 April. Places in Canada, like Southern Ontario before passing over Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Cape Breton, will also offer a good view. Areas around these regions will experience a partial eclipse.\n\n-Are there any eclipses in 2024 in India?\n\nAlthough four eclipses will occur in 2024, none will be visible from India.\n\n-Where is the 2024 total solar eclipse the longest?\n\nThe US and parts of eastern Canada will get a long window of over four minutes to see the total solar eclipse.\n\n-Who will see a total eclipse in 2024?\n\nResidents of Pacific coastal Mexico, continental US and eastern Canada will be able to see the total solar eclipse.", "source": {"uri": "lifestyleasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Thomas Shahan\n\nThere are few experiences more awe-inspiring than witnessing a total solar eclipse. Watching the moon slowly bite chunks out of the sun, feeling the temperature drop, and finally seeing the sun's corona during the eclipse totality - it's enough to flip your brain upside down. This year, millions of people will be able to see just how it feels on April 8th, when the Great North American Eclipse carves a path across the United States. It will be 20 more years before the continental U.S. has this chance again.\n\nWhile the eclipse of 2017 was thrilling, this April's eclipse is set to be even more spectacular, as the length of the totality - the time when the sun is completely blocked by the moon - will be twice as long. It's well worth traveling to experience.\n\nWhere Can I See The Eclipse?\n\nWhen deciding where to view the eclipse, you'll want to consider weather - not only will it be warm or cold, but crucially, will it be sunny? You'll also need to decide if you want to spend this event in a city, in nature, or in a place with access to both. In all these regards, one of your best bets is to plan to spend the Great North American Eclipse in Arkansas. The line of totality cuts right through the state, giving you eclipse viewing options ranging from cities to mountains, in the middle of a lake or in the middle of a music festival. We've rounded up some amazing options, below.\n\nCentral to Festivals and Fishing.\n\nRussellville, a city of 30,000, is a great place to see the eclipse while also getting a taste of everything Arkansas has to offer. It's near the center of the path of the eclipse, and will experience 4 minutes, 11 seconds of a totally eclipsed sun. It even has its own website aggregating eclipse events. These include hot air balloon rides, a \"Moon Over Main\" festival featuring a presentation from NASA, and a mass wedding event called \"Elope In The Eclipse.\"\n\nThough it's a city with abundant lodging and dining options, it's also a good access point to nature, as it borders Lake Dardanelle, a 34,300-acre reservoir on the Arkansas River. Lake Dardanelle State Park offers opportunities for fishing, swimming, kayaking, and camping, and has a visitor center with five aquariums.\n\nRussellville is also only ten miles from Mount Nebo State Park, where you can watch the eclipse from the summit of the 1,350-foot mountain. Spend the weekend before hiking or mountain biking on the 32.6 miles of trails, swimming in the park's swimming pool, playing tennis, or even hang gliding.\n\nA National Park and Historic Downtown.\n\nHot Springs is an ideal location to view the Great North American Eclipse. It's got it all: fancy resorts, tent camping, hiking trails, a gangster museum, and - crucially - 3 minutes and 37 seconds of totality. Based on weather from the last five years of April 8ths, it's likely to experience sun and clouds and pleasant temperatures on the day of.\n\nThere are only two National Parks in the line of the totality, and one of them is Arkansas' Hot Springs National Park. The park consists of a row of historic bath houses fed by natural springs in the area, as well as nearby protected natural areas including trails, carriage roads, and an observation tower.\n\nOrganizations across Hot Springs and the surrounding area are celebrating the eclipse with a weekend full of events. On April 4th, Hot Springs is hosting a presentation from NASA and a public blues concert. The Mid-America Science Museum is hosting a Total Solar Eclipse Weekend with planetarium shows and eclipse viewing, the Garvan Woodland Gardens is offering early entry and food trucks, and the Oaklawn Racing Casino is having an event with live music. For those hoping to experience the event surrounded by mountains, Atlas Obscura is hosting its 2024 Ecliptic Festival three miles from downtown Hot Springs in Cedar Glades Park, as a joint event with the 20th annual Valley of the Vapors Independent Music Festival. This is just a fraction of the events!\n\nThe plethora of viewing parties and festivals means that Hot Springs is likely to be a popular destination on April 8, so make your reservations as soon as possible (lodging options are aggregated here). If you're willing to drive, consider camping in the Ouachita National Forest, which is at the center of the path of totality, or even staying an hour away in Little Rock, which will also experience the totality (though only 2 minutes and 20 seconds of it).\n\nRural Rapids.\n\nCossatot River State Park-Natural Area is the Arkansas State Park that will experience the longest duration of totality, with a full 4 minutes and 18.5 seconds to watch the sun's corona. The park is a great option if you'd prefer to see the eclipse in nature a little further away from major population centers. You can make a weekend out of canoeing or kayaking the Cossatot River, including the Class IV rapids of Cossatot Falls, or hiking the park's nearly 20 miles of trails. Limited camping is available.\n\nMoon Over Main Street USA.\n\nThe town of Heber Springs will get 4 minutes, 2.4 seconds of totality, with the partial eclipse starting at 12:35pm and the totality starting at 1:52 p.m. It's the perfect place to spend eclipse weekend if you'd like to have access to the amenities of a town but be somewhere a little more quaint than a proper city. Heber Springs has a town square, a courthouse, and a restored one-screen art deco movie theater playing new releases. Accommodations include resorts, cabins, and campgrounds.\n\nThe town is also a great jumping off point for outdoor activities given its location on Greers Ferry Lake, one of the largest lakes in Arkansas, offering the unique opportunity to view the eclipse from a body of water. To round out your weekend you can check out the mineral springs in nearby Springs Park and the hiking and mountain biking trails at Sugarloaf Mountain.\n\nA Rustic Lodge on a Bluff.\n\nThis state park in central Arkansas will be treated to 4 minutes and 15 seconds of total solar eclipse. From its overlooks of the surrounding mountains, you'll be able to watch darkness sweep over the rest of Arkansas. Petit Jean is a park well worth spending some time exploring, with a 95-foot-tall waterfall, as well as canyons, forests, streams, and a natural bridge.. The state park also offers a boat launch, swimming pools, playgrounds, and a tennis and basketball court.\n\nLodging options include campsites, cabins, yurts, and rooms at the rustic-style Mather Lodge. Overlooking Cedar Creek Canyon, Mather Lodge offers a restaurant as well. It was built - as were many of the cabins, bridges, roads, and trails in the park - by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s.\n\nElk on the Buffalo River.\n\nYellville, a small town in northern Arkansas, can serve as a launching point to spend the day of the eclipse in a number of different natural areas. The town itself will see 2 minutes and 47 seconds of totality, but to the south the Buffalo National River will have even longer. That area, a National Park Service unit, offers canoeing, fishing, hiking, rock climbing, caving, and horseback riding. The river flows past tall bluffs and its banks are home to a herd of approximately 600 elk; it's hard to think of a more idyllic place to experience the wonders of the eclipse. Closer to Yellville, Crooked Creek also provides great opportunities for hiking and for smallmouth bass fishing.\n\nThe Perfect Place for Music Lovers.\n\nJonesboro will only experience 2 minutes 21.5 seconds of totality, but it's the perfect home base to spend an eclipse weekend exploring both cities and nature. On the day of the eclipse, driving north or west will take you into areas that experience longer durations of totality. And staying in Jonesboro (lodging options here) allows you to experience the city. Home to nearly 80,000 people and Arkansas State University, Jonesboro is one of the more progressive cities in the state. And for music lovers, it's only an hour drive away from both Johnny Cash's boyhood home in Dyess, Arkansas, and from Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nHow Can I Do This Without Going Blind?\n\nNever look directly at the sun! It's not like the sun during an eclipse has special powers - looking at the sun on any old day has the potential to cause permanent eye damage and blindness. It's just that you're less likely to stare at the sun on a day when there isn't a total solar eclipse.\n\nTo watch the sun during an eclipse, you need special safety glasses. (Sunglasses are not good enough, nor are x-rays, exposed film, or most welder's glasses.) Because fake glasses proliferated online during the 2017 eclipse, it's best to buy your eclipse glasses directly from a manufacturer or certified seller. The American Astronomical Society has a round-up of trusted sellers here.\n\nDuring the totality, when the sun is entirely blocked by the moon, it's safe to take your glasses off to look at the corona. (Don't worry, the world doesn't become pitch black during the totality - it remains about as bright out as a night with a full moon.) But the moment a sliver of the sun reappears, you need to go back to using your eclipse glasses.\n\nAnything Else I Should Know?\n\nIf you can't see the sun, you can't see the eclipse, so it's a good idea to keep an eye on the weather forecast the day of April 8 and be prepared to drive to an area with clearer skies if need be.\n\nAs the moon begins to obscure the sun, temperatures usually drop about ten degrees, though they sometimes drop as much as twenty. Be sure to bring a sweater or jacket.\n\nArkansas expects heavy traffic preceding and following the eclipse. Traffic conditions will be updated in real time here.\n\nTo find out the exact start time of the partial and total eclipse wherever you end up, you can use this interactive Google map.\n\nSmall towns may be overloaded with visitors during eclipse weekend, so it's a good idea to stock up on food and gas early. Because cell coverage and WiFi may be slow, it's also smart to carry cash and to have a physical map of where you're trying to go.\n\nA full list of events, weather information, and FAQs about

NASA's latest trailer for the event -- published this week -- reveals several ways to safely view the eclipse beyond simply wearing solar eclipse glasses. All, however, are designed to protect your eyes while looking at the eclipse.\n\nThe trailer -- which comes in the wake of a video designed to inspire potential eclipse chasers in the U.S. -- begins with a reminder that using regular sunglasses to directly view the eclipse can cause permanent damage to your vision. While solar eclipse glasses have black polymer or carbon black-infused lenses that block 99% of visible, infrared and ultraviolet light from the sun, sunglasses do not. The result can be solar retinopathy -- damage to cells in the retina -- also known as \"eclipse blindness.\" There are no pain receptors in the retina so this can happen without feeling pain. However, NASA suggests other safe ways to follow the eclipse indirectly other than using eclipse glasses.\n\n\"You need proper solar-safe viewing glasses or an indirect viewing method whenever the bright face of the sun is visible,\" says NASA's video. \"The only time you can look at a total solar eclipse without eye protection is during the brief period of totality when the moon completely covers the sun.\" On April 8 that will only apply to those who live in, or travel to, the path of totality, a 115-mile-wide track across parts of northwest Mexico, 15 U.S. states and southeastern Canada. Everyone outside this path will need to use eclipse glasses or an indirect method to view any part of the eclipse. However, even those within the path will see partial phases on either side of totality, so NASA's advice is for everyone.\n\nIt also reminds everyone to check that your solar eclipse glasses -- if you already have some -- are undamaged and are ISO-certified (if you have yet to purchase any, use the American Astronomical Society's vetted list of suppliers and resellers, which NASA recommends).\n\nThe video then describes and explains some safe ways to use the pinhole projection method to safely view the eclipse indirectly. \"The simplest is to use your hands,\" says the video, telling viewers to stand with their back to the sun and cross one hand over the other with outstretched fingers to create a waffle pattern. \"Look at your hands' shadow on the ground -- the little spaces between your fingers will project a grid of small images of the sun showing the sun's crescent shape during the eclipse.\" This works well once the sun is about 50% eclipsed.\n\nYou can also see crescent suns projected through the canopies of trees. \"The tiny spaces between the leaves act as pinhole projectors scattering images of the sun on the ground,\" says NASA. It works even better if you use anything with small defined holes -- such as a hole-punched index card or a colander or spaghetti spoon from your kitchen.\n\nBut perhaps the best known, if rather fiddly, way of watching an eclipse using pinhole projection is to make your own pinhole camera. \"If you're feeling crafty, you can build a box pinhole viewer using everyday household items,\" advises NASA. \"This method streams sunlight through a pin-sized hole to project an image of the sun onto a white sheet of paper taped inside the box.\" The longer the box, the bigger your image of the sun will be. NASA's How to Make a Box Pinhole Projector video on YouTube explains this method in-depth.\n\nProjecting crescent suns through hands, colanders, and boxes is easy, but the eclipse image is very small. For a larger and more impressive image, NASA recommends optical projection. It requires using a telescope or binoculars affixed with a solar filter to project the sun's image onto a large viewing surface. \"This method creates a bigger, brighter and sharper image that many people can view at the same time,\" says the video. \"However, you should not attempt optical projection unless you are an experienced astronomer and can supervise your equipment at all times.\" That's great advice because it is a little complicated. \"You must first install a certified solar filter to the front of your instrument -- eclipse glasses can't be used with these devices,\" advises NASA. If you want to try optical projection, begin with this guide on the American Astronomical Society website.\n\n\"Experiencing a solar eclipse is one way everyone can participate in NASA Science,\" says the space agency at the end of its video. \"Now you have the knowledge to participate safely.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar eclipse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pinhole camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Retina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lens"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crescent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infrared"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ultraviolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polymer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Astronomical_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Astronomical Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eye protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u0a15\u0a48\u0a28\u0a47\u0a21\u0a3e"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "\u0a15\u0a48\u0a28\u0a47\u0a21\u0a3e"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Projector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_filter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Optical filter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scattering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binoculars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Binoculars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telescope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astronomer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Software", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses,_Occultations_and_Transits", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses, Occultations and Transits", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65dda301622443bfcad5af8d/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=712,334,x592,y570,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "eventUri": "eng-9354729", "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 446951219, "relevance": 1}

And that's just one tiny, narrow shadow that sweeps across Earth's surface, as the Moon orbits and we rotate. So, you have to be in the path of totality in order to see it.\"\n\nI, on the other hand, describe Arkansas' total solar eclipse as a rare period of time where grifters and artisans can hock their wares. The past week, my social media timeline has been plagued with people selling eclipse-themed merchandise.\n\nIt almost feels like the scene from \"Spaceballs\" where Mel Brooks is merchandising Spaceballs novelties like Spaceballs the cereal or Spaceballs the flamethrower. I have seen, similarly, people selling \"Arkansas the total eclipse\" T-shirts, \"Arkansas the total eclipse\" bumper stickers, \"Arkansas the total eclipse\" specialty eclipse sunglasses, and an \"Arkansas the total eclipse\" commemorative coin. Alright, I might be overexaggerating about the commemorative coin, but there are hundreds of eclipse products out there for you to stock up on to get ready for the blackout.\n\nOn top of all the novelties available, there will be plenty of events and parties leading up to and on the big day. Ron Robinson Theater is celebrating the total eclipse by offering several science fiction and space epic screenings throughout the month of March. Movies included in the lineup are James Cameron's 1986 action-packed \"Aliens,\" Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's 2013 film \"Gravity,\" which has Sandra Bullock floating alone in the vastness of space for two intense hours, and Luc Besson's 1997 goofy and fun \"The Fifth Element\" where Bruce Willis plays a taxicab driver who is tasked with saving the entire galaxy from an evil, sentient ball of fire. They'll even be playing the cult classic \"Barbarella,\" Jane Fonda's space epic featuring go-go boots and shag carpet.\n\nSandra Bullock stars in the 2013 film 'Gravity.'\n\nThe Arkansas Museum of Fine Arts is also getting in on the festivities by hosting two films on April 7 that feature eclipses, \"Fantasia\" and \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" These films are being presented in partnership with the Arkansas Cinema Society. Last month at AMFA's screening of an Oscar-nominated film, I ran into the society's resident film curator, Craig Robinson, who mentioned programming these two eclipse films. He said that this was the first time in 30 years that Disney is letting \"Fantasia\" out of the vault to screen in theaters. In fact, the last time it was in theaters was in 1990.\n\nI remember seeing \"Fantasia\" when I was a kid. I recall renting the VHS copy back when its sequel, the lackluster \"Fantasia 2000,\" was released. The original was released in 1940, and for those of you that are too young to remember the plot ... well there isn't one, as the film is broken up into eight vignettes.\n\nA lobby card for Walt Disneys 1940 film 'Fantasia' which the Arkansas Cinema Society will screen at the Arkansas Museum of Fine Arts on April 7.\n\nThe more memorable segments of the film consist of Mickey Mouse causing chaos while serving as a sorcerer's apprentice by making mops and brooms come to life, a ballet dance between an ostrich and a hippo who try to attempt the Patrick Swayze/Jennifer Grey \"Dirty Dancing\" catch routine, and a truly frightening segment that takes place on Walpurgis night where Satan shows up and summons evil spirits.\n\nEach of these vignettes is accompanied by some of the best classical music ranging from \"Ave Maria\" to tunes by Beethoven and Ponchielli. The sequence that features the eclipse comes in about halfway through the film as Igor Stravinsky's \"Rite of Spring\" plays to the images of Earth's creation all the way through the destruction of the dinosaurs.\n\nIn \"2001\" the first image we see is the eclipse. The film opens slowly with Richard Strauss' \"Thus Spake Zarathustra\" fading into the soundtrack. The camera then slowly pans up from darkness to reveal that the Sun, Moon and Earth are in perfect alignment.\n\nThe film then cuts to Earth during its more primordial/Cro-Magnon era as we see a group of our ape like ancestors worshipping a giant black monolith. And with one swift edit the movie transitions thousands of years in the future, where space travel for mankind is commonplace. It's a powerful juxtaposition.\n\nBut my favorite section of the film comes toward the end, where the spaceship's artificial intelligence system, named HAL 9000, attempts to kill the ship's crew in order to salvage its mission. This leads to one of the saddest on-screen deaths in cinema history.\n\nThe total solar eclipse is slated to last only around 4\u00bd minutes. But as deGrasse Tyson says, \"it should be on everybody's bucket list, because broad daylight goes to darkness in a matter of seconds, and boom, it's nighttime.\"\n\nAnd no matter if you want to celebrate this celestial event all month long, or if you want to binge-watch science fiction films the night before, go out and buy the novelty sunglasses and the handcrafted T-shirts, because the total eclipse of Arkansas is something we'll not see again in our lifetime.", "source": {"uri": "nwaonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette"}, "authors": [],

On that day, about four million Americans will get in their cars and drive into a seemingly random path just 115 miles wide that stretches across parts of Mexico, 15 U.S. states and Canada. Those visitors could spend a lot of money.\n\nWhile everyone else in North America will see a \"meh\" partial solar eclipse, those who live or travel to the path will experience totality -- a brief view of the sun's spiky white corona -- as the moon drifts across it to create an indescribably powerful \"hole in the sky\" moment.\n\nTotality leaves the average viewer completely gobsmacked. Sometimes in tears. It's a rare and priceless moment -- and it could be hugely profitable to switched-on communities.\n\nA total solar eclipse tends to visit a particular place about once every 375 years. For a country the size of the U.S. it's more common than that, of course, but 50 or 100 years can go past without one. The U.S. is in the highly unusual position of having had its last total solar eclipse less than seven years ago.\n\nAlthough as many as four times the number that traveled into the path of totality on August 21, 2017 are expected to do so this April 8, what happened back then has proved a unique and illuminating guide for communities and cities lucky enough to be inside the path of totality in 2024.\n\nOne of the most memorable publicity campaigns in 2017 was from tiny Hopkinsville, Kentucky, which changed its name for one day to \"Eclipseville\" to mark the longest duration totality anywhere on the path at 2 minutes 40 seconds. Its marketing spend of $3 million reaped $30 million from 48,000 visitors. Few small towns can match that budget, but the playbook is there to follow.\n\nOne follower is Lebanon, Indiana, a town within the path of totality that hopes a marketing spend of $125,000 will double or triple its population of 17,000 on April 8 and could generate $1.2-$1.5 million in economic impact. \"That would be a major win economically, and it would also be validating,\" said Joe LePage, CFRM Communications & Community Development, Lebanon, Indiana, in an interview. Lebanon is one of the forgotten \"donut counties\" around Indianapolis. \"We did a lot of benchmarking with a lot of similar-sized communities, but Hopkinsville was the poster child for how to do it,\" said LePage.\n\nLebanon decided to go local, targeting the Greater Lafayette area -- a community of 250,000 people on the cusp of the path -- just 35 miles north on Interstate 65. Lebanon's marketing spend may be low compared to cities, but it could have a major impact if the same 10x economic multiplicity that Hopkinsville achieved. \"We want to have not only a great event for local people and visitors but also one that will benefit our local economy,\" said LePage. \"If you market it, they will come -- but at the very least we'll recoup the money.\"\n\nAnother small community in Indiana, Johnson County, will host Eclipse Festival 2024 in Franklin, south of Indianapolis, and expects $10-$25 million to be added to the local economy, according to the Daily Journal. That's based on the example of Casper, Wyoming, in 2017, which saw a $7.53 million impact.\n\nPerhaps the earliest to realize the opportunity this coming eclipse represents was Rochester, New York, which has been preparing for four years for its 3 minutes and 38 seconds of totality. \"We'll have a weekend of festivals, events and activities, and the whole town is just going to be brimming with excitement -- everyone under the sun is a stakeholder,\" said Rachel Laber Pulvino, vice president of communications at Visit Rochester, in an interview. It was confirmed long ago that schools will be closed on April 8 in the city, which will stage the Roc the Eclipse festival at the Rochester Museum & Science Center. \"Everyone can be outside and can take part -- it's a real community effort, with everything planned being built for locals but also so visitors will choose Rochester for their eclipse vacation,\" said Laber Pulvino.\n\nVisit Rochester expects 375-500,000 on Monday, April 8 -- most from major cities like New York City and Boston -- though many are staying Sunday through Tuesday thanks ot its #TakeTuesdayToo. The direct economic impact is estimated at $10 to $12 million.\n\nThe eclipse will happen whether communities prepare or not, but not all have such a joined-up approach. On April 8, the largest city in the path of totality will be the Dallas-Fort Worth megalopolis, where as many as 7.5 million people will have one of nature's rarest and grandest experiences. \"Each city in DFW acts as if they're their own entity instead of looking at what we could do as a region,\" said Jo Trizila, founder and CEO of TrizCom PR & Pitch PR, in an interview. \"If we'd pooled our resources together, imagine the advertising campaigns we could have had.\"\n\nTrizila, who in the absence of any unified approach in Dallas, set up Total Eclipse DFW as a go-to resource, thinks 20% could be added to the region's population on April 8. \"Hotel bookings are up by 400%, so they are coming,\" she said. Schools in some small communities will close on April 8, but others will remain open. \"Only a fraction of schools are equipped with the necessary eye protection,\" said Trizila. \"So thousands of students will miss out on what is truly a once-in-a-lifetime event.\"\n\nVisit Dallas is now publicizing a few events in Downtown Dallas, but the lack of a central organizer has created apathy and a scatter-gun approach. \"New York's governor has been issuing press releases about how excited they are to welcome visitors and for the residents to experience this -- they have done a really really good job,\" said Trizila. \"I wish our city leaders were coming out -- it's just dumbfounding.\"\n\nWill lessons be learned for the next big total solar eclipse in the U.S? The moon's shadow is rarely as kind to one country as it has been to the U.S, but there's a long wait until the next coast-to-coast total solar eclipse on August 12, 2045. Maybe by then a generation of people will be in-post that grew up seeing two total solar eclipses -- and will instantly know how seriously to treat the coming of the moon's central shadow.", "source":

With that in mind, here's a list of terms you might want to get familiar with:\n\nBaily's Beads: Caused by shafts of sunlight shining through deep valleys on the lunar limb (edge), they look like a series of brilliant beads popping on and off. They appear just before second contact and just after third contact at annular and total solar eclipses. They're named after the English astronomer Francis Baily, who first described them during the annular eclipse of May 15, 1836.\n\nChromosphere: A thin, red-colored layer of solar atmosphere located just above the photosphere. It is briefly visible immediately after the second contact and just before the third contact at a total solar eclipse.\n\nCorona: The Sun's upper atmosphere, visible as a pearly glow around the eclipsed Sun during totality. Its shape (sometimes elongated, sometimes round) is determined by the Sun's magnetic field and is linked to the sunspot cycle.\n\nDiamond Ring: A single Baily's Bead, shining like a brilliant diamond set into a pale ring created by the pearly white corona. It's the signal that totality is about to start (second contact) or has ended (third contact).\n\nDuration: The time between the second and third contact during a total or annular solar eclipse.\n\nSolar eclipse 2024: What time does it start; will I be able to see it; glasses; how to view it?\n\nEclipse Magnitude: The fraction of the Sun's diameter covered by the Moon. It is a ratio of Sun/Moon diameters and should not be confused with eclipse obscuration (see next item). When the eclipse magnitude is 50% (that is, when 50% of the Sun's diameter is covered), only about 40% of the solar surface area is obscured.\n\nEclipse Obscuration: The fraction of the Sun's surface area covered by the Moon. Do not confuse it with eclipse magnitude (see previous item). When 50% of the solar surface area is obscured, the eclipse magnitude is roughly 60%.\n\nFirst Contact (C1): The moment when the Moon takes its first tiny nibble out of the solar disk -- the beginning of the partial phase of an eclipse.\n\nLooking at over a century of total solar eclipses in the U.S.\n\nFourth (last) Contact (C4): The instant when the Moon no longer covers any part of the solar disk. This signals the conclusion of the partial phase of an eclipse.\n\nNew Moon: The lunar phase when the Moon is located in the same direction in the sky as the Sun. New Moon is the only lunar phase during which an eclipse of the Sun can occur.\n\nPartial Eclipse: A solar eclipse where the Moon covers only a portion of the Sun. A partial eclipse precedes and follows totality or annularity, but a partial can also occur by itself. A partial solar eclipse is visible over a wider swath of Earth than is totality or annularity.\n\nPenumbra: The portion of the Moon's shadow in which only part of the Sun is covered. An observer standing in the penumbra sees a partial solar eclipse.\n\nPhotosphere: The visible surface of the Sun, which consists of a gas layer at a temperature of roughly 5,500\u00b0 Celsius (10,000\u00b0 Fahrenheit).\n\nProminence: Hot gas hanging just above the solar surface, usually appearing as a red-colored arc or filament hovering in the lower part of the corona. Prominences are quickly covered by the Moon after the second contact and revealed just before the third contact at a total solar eclipse.\n\n[DOWNLOAD: Free Action News Jax app for alerts as news breaks]\n\nSecond Contact (C2): The instant when the total or annular phase of an eclipse begins. For a total eclipse, this is synonymous with the disappearance of the first diamond ring. At second contact during a total solar eclipse, darkness suddenly falls (but only to the level of deep twilight).\n\nThird Contact (C3): The instant when the total or annular phase of a solar eclipse ends. For a total eclipse, this is synonymous with the appearance of the second diamond ring. At third contact during a total solar eclipse, daylight suddenly returns.\n\nTotal Eclipse: A solar eclipse where the apparent diameter of the Moon is large enough to completely cover the Sun's photosphere (even if only momentarily) and reveal the faint solar corona.\n\n[SIGN UP: Action News Jax Daily Headlines Newsletter]\n\nTotality: The maximum phase of a total solar eclipse, during which the Moon's disk completely covers the Sun's bright face. Totality occurs between the second and third contact. It can last from a fraction of a second to a maximum of 7 minutes 31 seconds.\n\nUmbra: The darkest part of the Moon's shadow, within which the entirety of the Sun's bright face is blocked. Within the umbra, the Moon appears larger than the Sun. An observer standing in the umbra sees a total solar eclipse.\n\nUmbraphile: A solar-eclipse aficionado; a person who will do almost anything, and travel almost anywhere, to see totality.

Start planning now", "body": "Even as we travel around the globe, it's easy to forget that our planet is part of a much larger celestial dance. Sure, we mark the orbit of the Earth around the Sun each year, but nothing reminds us that we are part of something much bigger than the experience of watching the Moon slide in front of the Sun during a solar eclipse.\n\nThis year a \"total\" eclipse - occurring on April 8, 2024 - will be visible across the entire USA, and the path of \"totality\" will pass across several major metropolitan areas. Some 31 million Americans live in that part of the country, and many millions more will travel to experience the eclipse.\n\nHow to plan to see the 2024 solar eclipse\n\nThere are several different types of eclipses, which happen whenever one celestial body passes in front of another. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes in front of the Sun and casts its shadow over the Earth; when the Earth passes in front of the Sun and casts its shadow on the Moon, it's a lunar eclipse. Eclipses differ depending on how much of the Moon or Earth obscures the Sun - and when the Moon completely blocks the sun, we have a total solar eclipse.\n\nWhile the 2024 total solar eclipse will be at least partly visible across the Lower 48, we recommend staying in the path of \"totality\" - the dark shadow that passes over the Earth as the Moon completely blocks the Sun - for the most impressive experience. On April 8, the path of totality will run from southwest to northeast across the North American continent.\n\nIn the USA, the totality will be visible in parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine. Other parts of the USA will experience a partial solar eclipse, where only part of the Sun is blocked by the Moon.\n\nWhat are the best places in the USA to view the 2024 eclipse?\n\nThere are some particularly notable spots along the line of totality - ones well worth planning a trip to.\n\nNational parks are generally great spots to experience the wonder of the outdoors - and there are several within the path of totality for the 2024 solar eclipse. Hot Springs National Park in Arkansas will be the first national park to experience this phenomenon; the surrounding community is already preparing for an influx of visitors that day. Cleveland's Cuyahoga Valley National Park is another great spot to see the eclipse: it's an urban park ideally placed near hotels and other amenities also in the path of totality.\n\nBasing yourself in a major city is actually a great idea when planning an eclipse trip - and there are lots of them in the path of this one (in addition to Cleveland), including Dallas and Fort Worth, Indianapolis and Buffalo. These cities are easily accessible, with accommodations at all price points.\n\nOne last consideration in deciding where to view the 2024 solar eclipse is the weather: April 8 is still early in the spring season, and there's a chance that those famed spring showers might bring cloudy skies. Viewing spots further to the southwest like Texas or Oklahoma have a higher likelihood of clear skies on the day of the eclipse.\n\nWhat do I need to plan?\n\nMore than twice as many people live within easy travel distance of 2024's path of totality, compared with the 2017 solar eclipse that cut across America. This means many more folks will be traveling to see the phenomenon - making early arrangements essential.\n\nIf you want to join a tour or some other eclipse-related experience, NationalEclipse.com is managing a database of eclipse happenings related to the 2024 event, though there will likely be many that aren't listed there. So read up in advance on whatever might be happening at the viewing site you plan on traveling to.\n\nWhat else do I need to know?\n\nAs you might expect, NASA is a big promoter of the 2024 eclipse (several NASA sites are even located along or near the path of totality). NASA's \"Where & When\" page is very helpful in explaining the exact path as well as the science of eclipses. The site is especially useful if you're planning to view the eclipse with younger astronomy fans.\n\nGreat American Eclipse is another great web resource. While it's not managed by a professional astronomy organization, it's a sort of eclipse fan page that first became popular during the 2017 eclipse. Today, it hosts many fascinating maps about this year's event and other future eclipses.\n\nOne last tip: snag your eclipse viewing glasses today. Back in 2017, viewers encountered a shortage of safe glasses in the weeks leading up to the event - so getting a pair or box now is the best way to ensure you don't damage your eyes on the day of. Look for ones marked \"ISO 12312-2,\" which is the international code that says they protect your eyes from solar rays.\n\nIf you attend a viewing event, having a few extra pairs is also a great way to make friends and share in wonder of this special astronomical occurrence.", "source": {"uri": "lonelyplanet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lonely Planet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Perhaps to be in the great outdoors when nature's greatest site appears. Or maybe because you can't get a hotel anywhere in the path of totality.\n\nEither way, there's a rush to go camping in April. According to the camping reservation platform Hipcamp, bookings within the path of totality are up 9,000% for the same week year-over-year. It's projecting 30,000 to 40,000 booked nights outside in the U.S. during eclipse week in April.\n\nWith warmer weather and a higher chance of clear skies in early April, Texas is seeing the most significant surge in bookings, but some great spots remain, said Hipcamp. It recently published a blog post about the best campgrounds in the path of the eclipse that still have available campsites -- and many of them are in Arkansas.\n\nThe \"Natural State\" is something of a \"hidden gem\" for anyone looking for a campsite for the eclipse. Arkansas still has high availability and, crucially, has historically similar cloud cover than Texas to the southwest.\n\nDespite the Midwest being earlier in spring -- arguably late winter -- Hipcamp reports that many campsites in Missouri and Ohio are fast approaching 80% occupancy.\n\nCabins, yurts and RV sites across the path are booking up faster so far than tent sites, said Hipcamp.\n\nHipcamp's Solar Eclipse Camping Guide 2024: 100 Best Campgrounds is worth checking out, as is its rival Campspot's Where to Camp for the 2024 Solar Eclipse Path. Another good resource is National Eclipse's Eclipse Lodging & Camping page.\n\nWherever you source a campsite from, be sure to check its exact location using this interactive Google Map. To see the total solar eclipse it must be anywhere within the path of totality -- though you could also consider staying just outside the path and driving into it early on April 8.\n\nHipcamp has thousands of campsites within the path of totality, a 115-mile-wide track through Mexico, the U.S. and Canada. Only from within it is it possible to experience a total solar eclipse as well as the partial phases. Everyone else in the U.S. will see only the partial phases.\n\n\"One of my biggest learnings from the total solar eclipse of 2017 is that the difference between 99% and totality is everything,\" said Alyssa Ravasio, CEO and founder of Hipcamp, in an email. \"It's absolutely worth it to get on that path of totality -- it's a magical moment, and it's the only chance a human has of truly understanding the scale and shape of our solar system with your eyes.\"\n\nTravelers get there early -- at least by a day or two -- to get settled in and ready for the big moment. \"After this April's total solar eclipse, there won't be another one in the contiguous U.S. until 2044, so this is a huge deal for a lot of people,\" said Ravasio in an email.\n\nThe U.S. states partly crossed by the path of totality comprise Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee (northwest corner), Michigan (southeast corner), Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipcamp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

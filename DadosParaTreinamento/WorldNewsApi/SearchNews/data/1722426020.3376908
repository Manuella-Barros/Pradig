{"id": 243267338, "title": "I went viral on Tik Tok after getting my hair caught in an electric whisk - check out my mullet", "text": "Natalie Walker, 38, suffered an unfortunate mishap last month when her long hair was caught in an electric whisk while she attempted to make pizza dough. The mum-of-two ended up having to cut the whisk blades from her elbow-length locks - leaving her with \"tufts\". The clips she posted garnered almost 10 million views on TikTok as she said the videos \"went mental\" - and said it's made her a 'local celebrity' as people recognise her wherever she goes. She says she gets stopped by people every time she leaves the house - asking if she is \"the girl who got her hair caught in a whisk\". Luckily Natalie sees the funny side - although she is now left debating whether to get her hair cut in a short pixie style as the incident left her with \"a mullet\". Natalie, a full-time mum, from Preston, Lancashire, said: \"I had my phone propped up making pizza dough, I was kneading it by hand but I wasn't kneading properly with my hands so I got the whisk. \"Something distracted me for a second and the next thing, my hair was caught in it. I was like 'this can't be happening!'. It's very very slowly growing back, but it was long and blonde before, now it's just tufts. I wear a hair clip to try and hide the tufts.\" Luckily, Natalie's children - aged 11 and 15 - were entertained by their mum's viral moment. But poor Natalie said she hasn't touched her electric whisk since the incident - and swears she'll be sticking with a hand whisk from now on. But thanks to the videos, Natalie said she feels like a \"local celebrity\" as she got so much online attention that people from her area recognise her. She said: \"I have had a fair few people each week who say 'are you the girl who got her hair caught in a whisk?'. \"I've been stopped on the bus before too. I say yes it is me - and people ask me questions like if it was painful. But I can have a laugh about it - I don't mind when they come up to me. I can't seem to walk anywhere without someone saying something now.\"", "summary": "<p>A mum was left with \"a mullet\" after getting her hair caught in an electric whisk.</p>", "url": "https://www.thescarboroughnews.co.uk/watch-this/im-the-girl-who-got-her-hair-caught-in-a-whisk-on-tik-tok-and-was-left-with-a-mullet-4683696", "image": "https://www.thescarboroughnews.co.uk/jpim-static/2024/06/28/10/20/Natalie-Walker-38-went-viral-on-Tik-Tok-after-getting-an-electric-whisk-stuck-in-her-hair.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:22:24", "author": "Vanessa Sims", "authors": ["Vanessa Sims"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.094}

StudioLab xR in Winnipeg, is one of four training facilities for extended reality in Canada. Established by New Media Manitoba, StudioLab xR senior manager Jonathan L\u00e9 has high hopes for its applications going into the future. The technology works by pairing a specialty camera to a grid on the studio\u2019s ceiling which relay\u2019s its coordinates in real time to a computer that operates a camera within the digital space. It\u2019 s all possible thanks to the Unreal Engine, a real-time 3D creation tool. L\u00e9 says the power behind the Unreal Engine helps clients can help bring ideas to life. \u201cWe\u2019re able to creat environments that otherwise wouldn\u2019t exist,\u201d L\u00e9 said. \u201cThose can be fantastical environments or they can be really mundane ones that are just hard to get into, so we\u2019re able to add basically a broader range of tools to Manitoba creatives.\u201d Those expanded tools are valuable to clients using the space, such as UpHouse, a Winnipeg marketing agency. Recently they used the studio to shoot an upcoming promotional campaign. Its creative director Brenlee Coates was surprised when many ideas they thought would be difficult were made possible with a simple keystroke. \u201cIt just felt like everything was achievable as we brought just a little bit of foreground to make it realistic,\u201d said Coates. \u201cStuff like the fireworks, we didn\u2019t know if that would look unrealistic, and it\u2019s something that\u2019s really simple for them to program.\u201d Being able to show clients the breadth of possibilities is extremely important to New Media Manitoba executive director Louie Ghiz, and part of that work according to Ghiz involves making it accessible. \u201cThis technology is so on the leading edge, that to go and get this type of training in other parts of the country, you\u2019d have to go to larger markets where it would probably be quite expensive,\u201d Ghiz explained. \u201cSo we\u2019re really trying to reduce the barriers to entry in terms of Manitobans having access to it, affordability, and just being able to do this in our backyard.\u201d Currently the space is used for training and production for TV, film, and videogames, but Ghiz mentions that he and his team have already begun introducing the technology to other industries in order to start the wheels turning on how it could reinvent how some traditional industries operate in the years ahead.", "summary": "StudioLab xR in Winnipeg, is one of four training facilities for extended reality in Canada.

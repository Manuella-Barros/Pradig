It may be a little country, but it's one of Europe's big treats. While its capital, Brussels, is an international hub, the port city to the north -- Antwerp -- has more of a local identity. It's an honest, what-you-see-is-what-you-get place, perhaps because it's in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium called Flanders.\n\nThis city of about 500,000 offers visitors an eclectic array of sightseeing -- and it's easy to navigate since most locals speak English. If you have just one day (or less), you'll need to be selective, choosing among art, churches, history and fashion.\n\nJust arriving can be a thrill. I can't think of a city with a more visit-worthy train station than Antwerp. The building stands like a temple to the Industrial Age. Built at the turn of the 20th century, it's giddy with steel and glass -- such as its arrival hall with a triumphal arch crowned by a grand clock.\n\nImagine the age: Just a generation earlier, people thought you might die if you traveled at more than 30 mph. For those living in the brave new world of steam engines, journeys that previously took days could be done in hours. Of course, today's trains can be five times faster; that's why the Belgians tunneled under the old station so that bullet trains can zip in and out with only a quick stop.\n\nStepping out of the station, you'll find some modern buildings due to Hitler's rocket attacks during World War II -- more V-2s fell on Antwerp than on London. Fortunately, most of the Old Town survived. As it has for centuries, the Cathedral of Our Lady dominates the city center; its 400-foot-tall spire is the tallest structure in the city. The interior is packed with fine artwork, including four paintings by local-boy-made-good Peter Paul Rubens.\n\nNext door, the Grote Markt, Antwerp's main square, is dominated by the looming tower of the cathedral at one end and the stately City Hall at the other. On a facade dating from Antwerp's golden age (16th century), the City Hall flies flags from dozens of countries -- representing the importance of international trade to the city.\n\nOne of the city's top sights is the Rubens House (main collection closed for renovation until 2027, www.rubenshuis.be). This former home of painter Peter Paul Rubens does a fine job of introducing visitors both to the artist's works -- several of which are displayed here -- and to his lifestyle. There are other places in Antwerp to see Rubens' paintings, but this exhibit offers you a chance to also learn about how he lived and the methods he employed -- interesting even to people who think Peter Paul Rubens was the guy who played Pee-wee Herman.\n\nAnother type of house is found in Antwerp's red light district, which is north of the Old Town and near the port. This is Belgium's biggest hub of legalized prostitution and one of the most business-like I've seen in Europe. About four city blocks are pedestrianized and feel almost like a shopping mall. I did notice that, while Antwerp has a slick red light neighborhood, it has almost no sleaze elsewhere in town. This sprawling brothel area is not as sketchy as it might seem -- the mayor actually encourages visitors to stroll here. It feels more comfortable to visit during the day, but it's livelier after dark.\n\nThe nearby Museum aan de Stroom (Museum on the River, or MAS for short, www.mas.be), is housed in a 210-foot-tall mod tower, encased in hand-cut red stone, and speckled with silver hands (the symbol of Antwerp). Designed to resemble the spiraling stacks of goods in an old warehouse, its maritime, ethnographic and folklore collections confirm Antwerp's reputation as a crossroads for the world. Take the bank of escalators to the top for a free, stunning view of the city.\n\nFashionistas love window-shopping in the Sint-Andries district south of the Old Town. Antwerp's status as a fashion mecca is a relatively recent development. In 1988, six students from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts' fashion department traveled to a London show, where they got a lot of attention. Each one opened a shop in Sint-Andries, and now it's one of Europe's top fashion zones.\n\nAs you explore Antwerp, you'll discover that many streets have their own personalities. For example, Schuttershofstraat and Hopland are where you'll find famous-label international couture, while Kammenstraat is better for trendy, retro-hipster fashions.\n\nIf funky urbanity is your thing, Antwerp is one of Europe's most intriguing cities. Compared to stodgy, bureaucratic Brussels, Antwerp's colorful persona respects its storied past even as it embraces its bright future.\n\nRick Steves writes European guidebooks, hosts travel shows on public TV and radio, and organizes European tours.

It may be a little country, but it's one of Europe's big treats. While its capital, Brussels, is an international hub, the port city to the north - Antwerp - has more of a local identity. It's an honest, what-you-see-is-what-you-get place, perhaps because it's in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium called Flanders.\n\nThis city of about 500,000 offers visitors an eclectic array of sightseeing - and it's easy to navigate since most locals speak English. If you have just one day (or less), you'll need to be selective, choosing among art, churches, history, and fashion.\n\nJust arriving can be a thrill. I can't think of a city with a more visit-worthy train station than Antwerp. The building stands like a temple to the Industrial Age. Built at the turn of the 20th century, it's giddy with steel and glass - such as its arrival hall with a triumphal arch crowned by a grand clock.\n\nImagine the age: Just a generation earlier, people thought you might die if you traveled at more than 30 miles per hour. For those living in the brave new world of steam engines, journeys that previously took days could be done in hours. Of course, today's trains can be five times faster; that's why the Belgians tunneled under the old station so that bullet trains can zip in and out with only a quick stop.\n\nStepping out of the station, you'll find some modern buildings due to Hitler's rocket attacks during World War II - more V-2s fell on Antwerp than on London. Fortunately, most of the Old Town survived. As it has for centuries, the Cathedral of Our Lady dominates the city center; its 400-foot-tall spire is the tallest structure in the city. The interior is packed with fine artwork, including four paintings by local-boy-made-good Peter Paul Rubens.\n\nNext door, the Grote Markt, Antwerp's main square, is dominated by the looming tower of the cathedral at one end and the stately City Hall at the other. On a facade dating from Antwerp's golden age (16th century), the City Hall flies flags from dozens of countries - representing the importance of international trade to the city.\n\nOne of the city's top sights is the Rubens House (main collection closed for renovation until 2027, www.rubenshuis.be). This former home of painter Peter Paul Rubens does a fine job of introducing visitors both to the artist's works - several of which are displayed here - and to his lifestyle. There are other places in Antwerp to see Rubens' paintings, but this exhibit offers you a chance to also learn about how he lived and the methods he employed - interesting even to people who think Peter Paul Rubens was the guy who played Pee-wee Herman.\n\nAnother type of house is found in Antwerp's red light district, which is north of the Old Town and near the port. This is Belgium's biggest hub of legalized prostitution and one of the most business-like I've seen in Europe. About four city blocks are pedestrianized and feel almost like a shopping mall. I did notice that, while Antwerp has a slick red light neighborhood, it has almost no sleaze elsewhere in town. This sprawling brothel area is not as sketchy as it might seem - the mayor actually encourages visitors to stroll here. It feels more comfortable to visit during the day, but it's livelier after dark.\n\nThe nearby Museum aan de Stroom (Museum on the River, or MAS for short, www.mas.be), is housed in a 210-foot-tall mod tower, encased in hand-cut red stone, and speckled with silver hands (the symbol of Antwerp). Designed to resemble the spiraling stacks of goods in an old warehouse, its maritime, ethnographic, and folklore collections confirm Antwerp's reputation as a crossroads for the world. Take the bank of escalators to the top for a free, stunning view of the city.\n\nFashionistas love window-shopping in the Sint-Andries district south of the Old Town. Antwerp's status as a fashion mecca is a relatively recent development. In 1988, six students from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts' fashion department traveled to a London show, where they got a lot of attention. Each one opened a shop in Sint-Andries, and now it's one of Europe's top fashion zones.\n\nAs you explore Antwerp, you'll discover that many streets have their own personalities. For example, Schuttershofstraat and Hopland are where you'll find famous-label international couture, while Kammenstraat is better for trendy, retro-hipster fashions.\n\nIf funky urbanity is your thing, Antwerp is one of Europe's most intriguing cities. Compared to stodgy, bureaucratic Brussels, Antwerp's colorful persona respects its storied past even as it embraces its bright future.\n\n========\n\n(Rick Steves (www.ricksteves.com) writes European guidebooks, hosts travel shows on public TV and radio, and organizes European tours.

It may be a little country, but it's one of Europe's big treats. While its capital, Brussels, is an international hub, the port city to the north - Antwerp - has more of a local identity. It's an honest, what-you-see-is-what-you-get place, perhaps because it's in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium called Flanders.\n\nThis city of about 500,000 offers visitors an eclectic array of sightseeing - and it's easy to navigate since most locals speak English. If you have just one day (or less), you'll need to be selective, choosing among art, churches, history, and fashion.\n\nJust arriving can be a thrill. I can't think of a city with a more visit-worthy train station than Antwerp. The building stands like a temple to the Industrial Age. Built at the turn of the 20th century, it's giddy with steel and glass - such as its arrival hall with a triumphal arch crowned by a grand clock.\n\nPeople are also reading...

For those living in the brave new world of steam engines, journeys that previously took days could be done in hours. Of course, today's trains can be five times faster; that's why the Belgians tunneled under the old station so that bullet trains can zip in and out with only a quick stop.\n\nStepping out of the station, you'll find some modern buildings due to Hitler's rocket attacks during World War II - more V-2s fell on Antwerp than on London. Fortunately, most of the Old Town survived. As it has for centuries, the Cathedral of Our Lady dominates the city center; its 400-foot-tall spire is the tallest structure in the city. The interior is packed with fine artwork, including four paintings by local-boy-made-good Peter Paul Rubens.\n\nNext door, the Grote Markt, Antwerp's main square, is dominated by the looming tower of the cathedral at one end and the stately City Hall at the other. On a facade dating from Antwerp's golden age (16th century), the City Hall flies flags from dozens of countries - representing the importance of international trade to the city.\n\nOne of the city's top sights is the Rubens House (main collection closed for renovation until 2027, www.rubenshuis.be). This former home of painter Peter Paul Rubens does a fine job of introducing visitors both to the artist's works - several of which are displayed here - and to his lifestyle. There are other places in Antwerp to see Rubens' paintings, but this exhibit offers you a chance to also learn about how he lived and the methods he employed - interesting even to people who think Peter Paul Rubens was the guy who played Pee-wee Herman.\n\nAnother type of house is found in Antwerp's red light district, which is north of the Old Town and near the port. This is Belgium's biggest hub of legalized prostitution and one of the most business-like I've seen in Europe. About four city blocks are pedestrianized and feel almost like a shopping mall. I did notice that, while Antwerp has a slick red light neighborhood, it has almost no sleaze elsewhere in town. This sprawling brothel area is not as sketchy as it might seem - the mayor actually encourages visitors to stroll here. It feels more comfortable to visit during the day, but it's livelier after dark.\n\nThe nearby Museum aan de Stroom (Museum on the River, or MAS for short, www.mas.be), is housed in a 210-foot-tall mod tower, encased in hand-cut red stone, and speckled with silver hands (the symbol of Antwerp). Designed to resemble the spiraling stacks of goods in an old warehouse, its maritime, ethnographic, and folklore collections confirm Antwerp's reputation as a crossroads for the world. Take the bank of escalators to the top for a free, stunning view of the city.\n\nFashionistas love window-shopping in the Sint-Andries district south of the Old Town. Antwerp's status as a fashion mecca is a relatively recent development. In 1988, six students from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts' fashion department traveled to a London show, where they got a lot of attention. Each one opened a shop in Sint-Andries, and now it's one of Europe's top fashion zones.\n\nAs you explore Antwerp, you'll discover that many streets have their own personalities. For example, Schuttershofstraat and Hopland are where you'll find famous-label international couture, while Kammenstraat is better for trendy, retro-hipster fashions.\n\nIf funky urbanity is your thing, Antwerp is one of Europe's most intriguing cities. Compared to stodgy, bureaucratic Brussels, Antwerp's colorful persona respects its storied past even as it embraces its bright future.\n\n(Rick Steves (www.ricksteves.com) writes European guidebooks, hosts travel shows on public TV and radio, and organizes European tours.

It may be a little country, but it's one of Europe's big treats. While its capital, Brussels, is an international hub, the port city to the north - Antwerp - has more of a local identity. It's an honest, what-you-see-is-what-you-get place, perhaps because it's in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium called Flanders.\n\nThis city of about 500,000 offers visitors an eclectic array of sightseeing - and it's easy to navigate since most locals speak English. If you have just one day (or less), you'll need to be selective, choosing among art, churches, history, and fashion.\n\nJust arriving can be a thrill. I can't think of a city with a more visit-worthy train station than Antwerp. The building stands like a temple to the Industrial Age. Built at the turn of the 20th century, it's giddy with steel and glass - such as its arrival hall with a triumphal arch crowned by a grand clock.\n\nPeople are also reading...

For those living in the brave new world of steam engines, journeys that previously took days could be done in hours. Of course, today's trains can be five times faster; that's why the Belgians tunneled under the old station so that bullet trains can zip in and out with only a quick stop.\n\nStepping out of the station, you'll find some modern buildings due to Hitler's rocket attacks during World War II - more V-2s fell on Antwerp than on London. Fortunately, most of the Old Town survived. As it has for centuries, the Cathedral of Our Lady dominates the city center; its 400-foot-tall spire is the tallest structure in the city. The interior is packed with fine artwork, including four paintings by local-boy-made-good Peter Paul Rubens.\n\nNext door, the Grote Markt, Antwerp's main square, is dominated by the looming tower of the cathedral at one end and the stately City Hall at the other. On a facade dating from Antwerp's golden age (16th century), the City Hall flies flags from dozens of countries - representing the importance of international trade to the city.\n\nOne of the city's top sights is the Rubens House (main collection closed for renovation until 2027, www.rubenshuis.be). This former home of painter Peter Paul Rubens does a fine job of introducing visitors both to the artist's works - several of which are displayed here - and to his lifestyle. There are other places in Antwerp to see Rubens' paintings, but this exhibit offers you a chance to also learn about how he lived and the methods he employed - interesting even to people who think Peter Paul Rubens was the guy who played Pee-wee Herman.\n\nAnother type of house is found in Antwerp's red light district, which is north of the Old Town and near the port. This is Belgium's biggest hub of legalized prostitution and one of the most business-like I've seen in Europe. About four city blocks are pedestrianized and feel almost like a shopping mall. I did notice that, while Antwerp has a slick red light neighborhood, it has almost no sleaze elsewhere in town. This sprawling brothel area is not as sketchy as it might seem - the mayor actually encourages visitors to stroll here. It feels more comfortable to visit during the day, but it's livelier after dark.\n\nThe nearby Museum aan de Stroom (Museum on the River, or MAS for short, www.mas.be), is housed in a 210-foot-tall mod tower, encased in hand-cut red stone, and speckled with silver hands (the symbol of Antwerp). Designed to resemble the spiraling stacks of goods in an old warehouse, its maritime, ethnographic, and folklore collections confirm Antwerp's reputation as a crossroads for the world. Take the bank of escalators to the top for a free, stunning view of the city.\n\nFashionistas love window-shopping in the Sint-Andries district south of the Old Town. Antwerp's status as a fashion mecca is a relatively recent development. In 1988, six students from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts' fashion department traveled to a London show, where they got a lot of attention. Each one opened a shop in Sint-Andries, and now it's one of Europe's top fashion zones.\n\nAs you explore Antwerp, you'll discover that many streets have their own personalities. For example, Schuttershofstraat and Hopland are where you'll find famous-label international couture, while Kammenstraat is better for trendy, retro-hipster fashions.\n\nIf funky urbanity is your thing, Antwerp is one of Europe's most intriguing cities. Compared to stodgy, bureaucratic Brussels, Antwerp's colorful persona respects its storied past even as it embraces its bright future.\n\n(Rick Steves (www.ricksteves.com) writes European guidebooks, hosts travel shows on public TV and radio, and organizes European tours.

This is Belgium's biggest hub of legalized prostitution and one of the most business-like I've seen in Europe. About four city blocks are pedestrianized and feel almost like a shopping mall. I did notice that, while Antwerp has a slick red light neighborhood, it has almost no sleaze elsewhere in town. This sprawling brothel area is not as sketchy as it might seem - the mayor actually encourages visitors to stroll here. It feels more comfortable to visit during the day, but it's livelier after dark.\n\nThe nearby Museum aan de Stroom (Museum on the River, or MAS for short, www.mas.be), is housed in a 210-foot-tall mod tower, encased in hand-cut red stone, and speckled with silver hands (the symbol of Antwerp). Designed to resemble the spiraling stacks of goods in an old warehouse, its maritime, ethnographic, and folklore collections confirm Antwerp's reputation as a crossroads for the world. Take the bank of escalators to the top for a free, stunning view of the city.\n\nFashionistas love window-shopping in the Sint-Andries district south of the Old Town. Antwerp's status as a fashion mecca is a relatively recent development. In 1988, six students from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts' fashion department traveled to a London show, where they got a lot of attention. Each one opened a shop in Sint-Andries, and now it's one of Europe's top fashion zones.\n\nAs you explore Antwerp, you'll discover that many streets have their own personalities. For example, Schuttershofstraat and Hopland are where you'll find famous-label international couture, while Kammenstraat is better for trendy, retro-hipster fashions.\n\nIf funky urbanity is your thing, Antwerp is one of Europe's most intriguing cities. Compared to stodgy, bureaucratic Brussels, Antwerp's colorful persona respects its storied past even as it embraces its bright future.\n\n(Rick Steves (www.ricksteves.com) writes European guidebooks, hosts travel shows on public TV and radio, and organizes European tours.

It may be a little country, but it's one of Europe's big treats. While its capital, Brussels, is an international hub, the port city to the north - Antwerp - has more of a local identity. It's an honest, what-you-see-is-what-you-get place, perhaps because it's in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium called Flanders.\n\nThis city of about 500,000 offers visitors an eclectic array of sightseeing - and it's easy to navigate since most locals speak English. If you have just one day (or less), you'll need to be selective, choosing among art, churches, history, and fashion.\n\nJust arriving can be a thrill. I can't think of a city with a more visit-worthy train station than Antwerp. The building stands like a temple to the Industrial Age. Built at the turn of the 20th century, it's giddy with steel and glass - such as its arrival hall with a triumphal arch crowned by a grand clock.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nCourt reverses itself on Arizona voter registration rules Led by star pitcher Hattie Macumber, World Series-bound Willcox is the Little League team that could 100 fun events happening in Tucson this August 2024 \ud83e\uddda\ud83e\ude84 Controversial Tucson-area Sen.

For those living in the brave new world of steam engines, journeys that previously took days could be done in hours. Of course, today's trains can be five times faster; that's why the Belgians tunneled under the old station so that bullet trains can zip in and out with only a quick stop.\n\nStepping out of the station, you'll find some modern buildings due to Hitler's rocket attacks during World War II - more V-2s fell on Antwerp than on London. Fortunately, most of the Old Town survived. As it has for centuries, the Cathedral of Our Lady dominates the city center; its 400-foot-tall spire is the tallest structure in the city. The interior is packed with fine artwork, including four paintings by local-boy-made-good Peter Paul Rubens.\n\nNext door, the Grote Markt, Antwerp's main square, is dominated by the looming tower of the cathedral at one end and the stately City Hall at the other. On a facade dating from Antwerp's golden age (16th century), the City Hall flies flags from dozens of countries - representing the importance of international trade to the city.\n\nOne of the city's top sights is the Rubens House (main collection closed for renovation until 2027, www.rubenshuis.be). This former home of painter Peter Paul Rubens does a fine job of introducing visitors both to the artist's works - several of which are displayed here - and to his lifestyle. There are other places in Antwerp to see Rubens' paintings, but this exhibit offers you a chance to also learn about how he lived and the methods he employed - interesting even to people who think Peter Paul Rubens was the guy who played Pee-wee Herman.\n\nAnother type of house is found in Antwerp's red light district, which is north of the Old Town and near the port. This is Belgium's biggest hub of legalized prostitution and one of the most business-like I've seen in Europe. About four city blocks are pedestrianized and feel almost like a shopping mall. I did notice that, while Antwerp has a slick red light neighborhood, it has almost no sleaze elsewhere in town. This sprawling brothel area is not as sketchy as it might seem - the mayor actually encourages visitors to stroll here. It feels more comfortable to visit during the day, but it's livelier after dark.\n\nThe nearby Museum aan de Stroom (Museum on the River, or MAS for short, www.mas.be), is housed in a 210-foot-tall mod tower, encased in hand-cut red stone, and speckled with silver hands (the symbol of Antwerp). Designed to resemble the spiraling stacks of goods in an old warehouse, its maritime, ethnographic, and folklore collections confirm Antwerp's reputation as a crossroads for the world.

It may be a little country, but it's one of Europe's big treats. While its capital, Brussels, is an international hub, the port city to the north - Antwerp - has more of a local identity. It's an honest, what-you-see-is-what-you-get place, perhaps because it's in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium called Flanders.\n\nThis city of about 500,000 offers visitors an eclectic array of sightseeing - and it's easy to navigate since most locals speak English. If you have just one day (or less), you'll need to be selective, choosing among art, churches, history, and fashion.\n\nJust arriving can be a thrill. I can't think of a city with a more visit-worthy train station than Antwerp. The building stands like a temple to the Industrial Age. Built at the turn of the 20th century, it's giddy with steel and glass - such as its arrival hall with a triumphal arch crowned by a grand clock.\n\nPeople are also reading...

For those living in the brave new world of steam engines, journeys that previously took days could be done in hours. Of course, today's trains can be five times faster; that's why the Belgians tunneled under the old station so that bullet trains can zip in and out with only a quick stop.\n\nStepping out of the station, you'll find some modern buildings due to Hitler's rocket attacks during World War II - more V-2s fell on Antwerp than on London. Fortunately, most of the Old Town survived. As it has for centuries, the Cathedral of Our Lady dominates the city center; its 400-foot-tall spire is the tallest structure in the city. The interior is packed with fine artwork, including four paintings by local-boy-made-good Peter Paul Rubens.\n\nNext door, the Grote Markt, Antwerp's main square, is dominated by the looming tower of the cathedral at one end and the stately City Hall at the other. On a facade dating from Antwerp's golden age (16th century), the City Hall flies flags from dozens of countries - representing the importance of international trade to the city.\n\nOne of the city's top sights is the Rubens House (main collection closed for renovation until 2027, www.rubenshuis.be). This former home of painter Peter Paul Rubens does a fine job of introducing visitors both to the artist's works - several of which are displayed here - and to his lifestyle. There are other places in Antwerp to see Rubens' paintings, but this exhibit offers you a chance to also learn about how he lived and the methods he employed - interesting even to people who think Peter Paul Rubens was the guy who played Pee-wee Herman.\n\nAnother type of house is found in Antwerp's red light district, which is north of the Old Town and near the port. This is Belgium's biggest hub of legalized prostitution and one of the most business-like I've seen in Europe. About four city blocks are pedestrianized and feel almost like a shopping mall. I did notice that, while Antwerp has a slick red light neighborhood, it has almost no sleaze elsewhere in town. This sprawling brothel area is not as sketchy as it might seem - the mayor actually encourages visitors to stroll here. It feels more comfortable to visit during the day, but it's livelier after dark.\n\nThe nearby Museum aan de Stroom (Museum on the River, or MAS for short, www.mas.be), is housed in a 210-foot-tall mod tower, encased in hand-cut red stone, and speckled with silver hands (the symbol of Antwerp). Designed to resemble the spiraling stacks of goods in an old warehouse, its maritime, ethnographic, and folklore collections confirm Antwerp's reputation as a crossroads for the world. Take the bank of escalators to the top for a free, stunning view of the city.\n\nFashionistas love window-shopping in the Sint-Andries district south of the Old Town. Antwerp's status as a fashion mecca is a relatively recent development. In 1988, six students from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts' fashion department traveled to a London show, where they got a lot of attention. Each one opened a shop in Sint-Andries, and now it's one of Europe's top fashion zones.\n\nAs you explore Antwerp, you'll discover that many streets have their own personalities. For example, Schuttershofstraat and Hopland are where you'll find famous-label international couture, while Kammenstraat is better for trendy, retro-hipster fashions.\n\nIf funky urbanity is your thing, Antwerp is one of Europe's most intriguing cities. Compared to stodgy, bureaucratic Brussels, Antwerp's colorful persona respects its storied past even as it embraces its bright future.\n\n(Rick Steves (www.ricksteves.com) writes European guidebooks, hosts travel shows on public TV and radio, and organizes European tours.

It may be a little country, but it's one of Europe's big treats. While its capital, Brussels, is an international hub, the port city to the north - Antwerp - has more of a local identity. It's an honest, what-you-see-is-what-you-get place, perhaps because it's in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium called Flanders.\n\nThis city of about 500,000 offers visitors an eclectic array of sightseeing - and it's easy to navigate since most locals speak English. If you have just one day (or less), you'll need to be selective, choosing among art, churches, history, and fashion.\n\nJust arriving can be a thrill. I can't think of a city with a more visit-worthy train station than Antwerp. The building stands like a temple to the Industrial Age. Built at the turn of the 20th century, it's giddy with steel and glass - such as its arrival hall with a triumphal arch crowned by a grand clock.\n\nPeople are also reading...

For those living in the brave new world of steam engines, journeys that previously took days could be done in hours. Of course, today's trains can be five times faster; that's why the Belgians tunneled under the old station so that bullet trains can zip in and out with only a quick stop.\n\nStepping out of the station, you'll find some modern buildings due to Hitler's rocket attacks during World War II - more V-2s fell on Antwerp than on London. Fortunately, most of the Old Town survived. As it has for centuries, the Cathedral of Our Lady dominates the city center; its 400-foot-tall spire is the tallest structure in the city. The interior is packed with fine artwork, including four paintings by local-boy-made-good Peter Paul Rubens.\n\nNext door, the Grote Markt, Antwerp's main square, is dominated by the looming tower of the cathedral at one end and the stately City Hall at the other. On a facade dating from Antwerp's golden age (16th century), the City Hall flies flags from dozens of countries - representing the importance of international trade to the city.\n\nOne of the city's top sights is the Rubens House (main collection closed for renovation until 2027, www.rubenshuis.be). This former home of painter Peter Paul Rubens does a fine job of introducing visitors both to the artist's works - several of which are displayed here - and to his lifestyle. There are other places in Antwerp to see Rubens' paintings, but this exhibit offers you a chance to also learn about how he lived and the methods he employed - interesting even to people who think Peter Paul Rubens was the guy who played Pee-wee Herman.\n\nAnother type of house is found in Antwerp's red light district, which is north of the Old Town and near the port. This is Belgium's biggest hub of legalized prostitution and one of the most business-like I've seen in Europe. About four city blocks are pedestrianized and feel almost like a shopping mall. I did notice that, while Antwerp has a slick red light neighborhood, it has almost no sleaze elsewhere in town. This sprawling brothel area is not as sketchy as it might seem - the mayor actually encourages visitors to stroll here. It feels more comfortable to visit during the day, but it's livelier after dark.\n\nThe nearby Museum aan de Stroom (Museum on the River, or MAS for short, www.mas.be), is housed in a 210-foot-tall mod tower, encased in hand-cut red stone, and speckled with silver hands (the symbol of Antwerp). Designed to resemble the spiraling stacks of goods in an old warehouse, its maritime, ethnographic, and folklore collections confirm Antwerp's reputation as a crossroads for the world. Take the bank of escalators to the top for a free, stunning view of the city.\n\nFashionistas love window-shopping in the Sint-Andries district south of the Old Town. Antwerp's status as a fashion mecca is a relatively recent development. In 1988, six students from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts' fashion department traveled to a London show, where they got a lot of attention. Each one opened a shop in Sint-Andries, and now it's one of Europe's top fashion zones.\n\nAs you explore Antwerp, you'll discover that many streets have their own personalities.

It may be a little country, but it's one of Europe's big treats. While its capital, Brussels, is an international hub, the port city to the north - Antwerp - has more of a local identity. It's an honest, what-you-see-is-what-you-get place, perhaps because it's in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium called Flanders.\n\nThis city of about 500,000 offers visitors an eclectic array of sightseeing - and it's easy to navigate since most locals speak English. If you have just one day (or less), you'll need to be selective, choosing among art, churches, history, and fashion.\n\nJust arriving can be a thrill. I can't think of a city with a more visit-worthy train station than Antwerp. The building stands like a temple to the Industrial Age. Built at the turn of the 20th century, it's giddy with steel and glass - such as its arrival hall with a triumphal arch crowned by a grand clock.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nWoman dies after being found near Highway 29 in St. Helena Napa Main Street downtown block home to Cole's, Ben & Jerry's, others sold for $17.5 million Update: Pedestrian, Calistoga cop involved in crash identified; woman critically injured Wine attorney Richard Mendelson says Napa Valley can find 'common ground' Napa's Soscol Junction makes its partial debut.

For those living in the brave new world of steam engines, journeys that previously took days could be done in hours. Of course, today's trains can be five times faster; that's why the Belgians tunneled under the old station so that bullet trains can zip in and out with only a quick stop.\n\nStepping out of the station, you'll find some modern buildings due to Hitler's rocket attacks during World War II - more V-2s fell on Antwerp than on London. Fortunately, most of the Old Town survived. As it has for centuries, the Cathedral of Our Lady dominates the city center; its 400-foot-tall spire is the tallest structure in the city. The interior is packed with fine artwork, including four paintings by local-boy-made-good Peter Paul Rubens.\n\nNext door, the Grote Markt, Antwerp's main square, is dominated by the looming tower of the cathedral at one end and the stately City Hall at the other. On a facade dating from Antwerp's golden age (16th century), the City Hall flies flags from dozens of countries - representing the importance of international trade to the city.\n\nOne of the city's top sights is the Rubens House (main collection closed for renovation until 2027, www.rubenshuis.be). This former home of painter Peter Paul Rubens does a fine job of introducing visitors both to the artist's works - several of which are displayed here - and to his lifestyle. There are other places in Antwerp to see Rubens' paintings, but this exhibit offers you a chance to also learn about how he lived and the methods he employed - interesting even to people who think Peter Paul Rubens was the guy who played Pee-wee Herman.\n\nAnother type of house is found in Antwerp's red light district, which is north of the Old Town and near the port. This is Belgium's biggest hub of legalized prostitution and one of the most business-like I've seen in Europe. About four city blocks are pedestrianized and feel almost like a shopping mall. I did notice that, while Antwerp has a slick red light neighborhood, it has almost no sleaze elsewhere in town. This sprawling brothel area is not as sketchy as it might seem - the mayor actually encourages visitors to stroll here. It feels more comfortable to visit during the day, but it's livelier after dark.\n\nThe nearby Museum aan de Stroom (Museum on the River, or MAS for short, www.mas.be), is housed in a 210-foot-tall mod tower, encased in hand-cut red stone, and speckled with silver hands (the symbol of Antwerp). Designed to resemble the spiraling stacks of goods in an old warehouse, its maritime, ethnographic, and folklore collections confirm Antwerp's reputation as a crossroads for the world. Take the bank of escalators to the top for a free, stunning view of the city.\n\nFashionistas love window-shopping in the Sint-Andries district south of the Old Town. Antwerp's status as a fashion mecca is a relatively recent development. In 1988, six students from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts' fashion department traveled to a London show, where they got a lot of attention. Each one opened a shop in Sint-Andries, and now it's one of Europe's top fashion zones.\n\nAs you explore Antwerp, you'll discover that many streets have their own personalities. For example, Schuttershofstraat and Hopland are where you'll find famous-label international couture, while Kammenstraat is better for trendy, retro-hipster fashions.\n\nIf funky urbanity is your thing, Antwerp is one of Europe's most intriguing cities. Compared to stodgy, bureaucratic Brussels, Antwerp's colorful persona respects its storied past even as it embraces its bright future.\n\n(Rick Steves (www.ricksteves.com) writes European guidebooks, hosts travel shows on public TV and radio, and organizes European tours.

It may be a little country, but it's one of Europe's big treats. While its capital, Brussels, is an international hub, the port city to the north - Antwerp - has more of a local identity. It's an honest, what-you-see-is-what-you-get place, perhaps because it's in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium called Flanders.\n\nThis city of about 500,000 offers visitors an eclectic array of sightseeing - and it's easy to navigate since most locals speak English. If you have just one day (or less), you'll need to be selective, choosing among art, churches, history, and fashion.\n\nJust arriving can be a thrill. I can't think of a city with a more visit-worthy train station than Antwerp. The building stands like a temple to the Industrial Age. Built at the turn of the 20th century, it's giddy with steel and glass - such as its arrival hall with a triumphal arch crowned by a grand clock.\n\nPeople are also reading...

For those living in the brave new world of steam engines, journeys that previously took days could be done in hours. Of course, today's trains can be five times faster; that's why the Belgians tunneled under the old station so that bullet trains can zip in and out with only a quick stop.\n\nStepping out of the station, you'll find some modern buildings due to Hitler's rocket attacks during World War II - more V-2s fell on Antwerp than on London. Fortunately, most of the Old Town survived. As it has for centuries, the Cathedral of Our Lady dominates the city center; its 400-foot-tall spire is the tallest structure in the city. The interior is packed with fine artwork, including four paintings by local-boy-made-good Peter Paul Rubens.\n\nNext door, the Grote Markt, Antwerp's main square, is dominated by the looming tower of the cathedral at one end and the stately City Hall at the other. On a facade dating from Antwerp's golden age (16th century), the City Hall flies flags from dozens of countries - representing the importance of international trade to the city.\n\nOne of the city's top sights is the Rubens House (main collection closed for renovation until 2027, www.rubenshuis.be). This former home of painter Peter Paul Rubens does a fine job of introducing visitors both to the artist's works - several of which are displayed here - and to his lifestyle. There are other places in Antwerp to see Rubens' paintings, but this exhibit offers you a chance to also learn about how he lived and the methods he employed - interesting even to people who think Peter Paul Rubens was the guy who played Pee-wee Herman.\n\nAnother type of house is found in Antwerp's red light district, which is north of the Old Town and near the port. This is Belgium's biggest hub of legalized prostitution and one of the most business-like I've seen in Europe. About four city blocks are pedestrianized and feel almost like a shopping mall. I did notice that, while Antwerp has a slick red light neighborhood, it has almost no sleaze elsewhere in town. This sprawling brothel area is not as sketchy as it might seem - the mayor actually encourages visitors to stroll here. It feels more comfortable to visit during the day, but it's livelier after dark.\n\nThe nearby Museum aan de Stroom (Museum on the River, or MAS for short, www.mas.be), is housed in a 210-foot-tall mod tower, encased in hand-cut red stone, and speckled with silver hands (the symbol of Antwerp). Designed to resemble the spiraling stacks of goods in an old warehouse, its maritime, ethnographic, and folklore collections confirm Antwerp's reputation as a crossroads for the world. Take the bank of escalators to the top for a free, stunning view of the city.\n\nFashionistas love window-shopping in the Sint-Andries district south of the Old Town. Antwerp's status as a fashion mecca is a relatively recent development. In 1988, six students from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts' fashion department traveled to a London show, where they got a lot of attention. Each one opened a shop in Sint-Andries, and now it's one of Europe's top fashion zones.\n\nAs you explore Antwerp, you'll discover that many streets have their own personalities. For example, Schuttershofstraat and Hopland are where you'll find famous-label international couture, while Kammenstraat is better for trendy, retro-hipster fashions.\n\nIf funky urbanity is your thing, Antwerp is one of Europe's most intriguing cities. Compared to stodgy, bureaucratic Brussels, Antwerp's colorful persona respects its storied past even as it embraces its bright future.\n\n(Rick Steves (www.ricksteves.com) writes European guidebooks, hosts travel shows on public TV and radio, and organizes European tours.

It may be a little country, but it's one of Europe's big treats. While its capital, Brussels, is an international hub, the port city to the north - Antwerp - has more of a local identity. It's an honest, what-you-see-is-what-you-get place, perhaps because it's in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium called Flanders.\n\nThis city of about 500,000 offers visitors an eclectic array of sightseeing - and it's easy to navigate since most locals speak English. If you have just one day (or less), you'll need to be selective, choosing among art, churches, history, and fashion.\n\nJust arriving can be a thrill. I can't think of a city with a more visit-worthy train station than Antwerp. The building stands like a temple to the Industrial Age. Built at the turn of the 20th century, it's giddy with steel and glass - such as its arrival hall with a triumphal arch crowned by a grand clock.\n\nPeople are also reading...

For those living in the brave new world of steam engines, journeys that previously took days could be done in hours. Of course, today's trains can be five times faster; that's why the Belgians tunneled under the old station so that bullet trains can zip in and out with only a quick stop.\n\nStepping out of the station, you'll find some modern buildings due to Hitler's rocket attacks during World War II - more V-2s fell on Antwerp than on London. Fortunately, most of the Old Town survived. As it has for centuries, the Cathedral of Our Lady dominates the city center; its 400-foot-tall spire is the tallest structure in the city. The interior is packed with fine artwork, including four paintings by local-boy-made-good Peter Paul Rubens.\n\nNext door, the Grote Markt, Antwerp's main square, is dominated by the looming tower of the cathedral at one end and the stately City Hall at the other. On a facade dating from Antwerp's golden age (16th century), the City Hall flies flags from dozens of countries - representing the importance of international trade to the city.\n\nOne of the city's top sights is the Rubens House (main collection closed for renovation until 2027, www.rubenshuis.be). This former home of painter Peter Paul Rubens does a fine job of introducing visitors both to the artist's works - several of which are displayed here - and to his lifestyle. There are other places in Antwerp to see Rubens' paintings, but this exhibit offers you a chance to also learn about how he lived and the methods he employed - interesting even to people who think Peter Paul Rubens was the guy who played Pee-wee Herman.\n\nAnother type of house is found in Antwerp's red light district, which is north of the Old Town and near the port. This is Belgium's biggest hub of legalized prostitution and one of the most business-like I've seen in Europe. About four city blocks are pedestrianized and feel almost like a shopping mall. I did notice that, while Antwerp has a slick red light neighborhood, it has almost no sleaze elsewhere in town. This sprawling brothel area is not as sketchy as it might seem - the mayor actually encourages visitors to stroll here. It feels more comfortable to visit during the day, but it's livelier after dark.\n\nThe nearby Museum aan de Stroom (Museum on the River, or MAS for short, www.mas.be), is housed in a 210-foot-tall mod tower, encased in hand-cut red stone, and speckled with silver hands (the symbol of Antwerp). Designed to resemble the spiraling stacks of goods in an old warehouse, its maritime, ethnographic, and folklore collections confirm Antwerp's reputation as a crossroads for the world. Take the bank of escalators to the top for a free, stunning view of the city.\n\nFashionistas love window-shopping in the Sint-Andries district south of the Old Town. Antwerp's status as a fashion mecca is a relatively recent development. In 1988, six students from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts' fashion department traveled to a London show, where they got a lot of attention. Each one opened a shop in Sint-Andries, and now it's one of Europe's top fashion zones.\n\nAs you explore Antwerp, you'll discover that many streets have their own personalities. For example, Schuttershofstraat and Hopland are where you'll find famous-label international couture, while Kammenstraat is better for trendy, retro-hipster fashions.\n\nIf funky urbanity is your thing, Antwerp is one of Europe's most intriguing cities. Compared to stodgy, bureaucratic Brussels, Antwerp's colorful persona respects its storied past even as it embraces its bright future.\n\n(Rick Steves (www.ricksteves.com) writes European guidebooks, hosts travel shows on public TV and radio, and organizes European tours.

It may be a little country, but it's one of Europe's big treats. While its capital, Brussels, is an international hub, the port city to the north - Antwerp - has more of a local identity. It's an honest, what-you-see-is-what-you-get place, perhaps because it's in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium called Flanders.\n\nThis city of about 500,000 offers visitors an eclectic array of sightseeing - and it's easy to navigate since most locals speak English. If you have just one day (or less), you'll need to be selective, choosing among art, churches, history, and fashion.\n\nJust arriving can be a thrill. I can't think of a city with a more visit-worthy train station than Antwerp. The building stands like a temple to the Industrial Age. Built at the turn of the 20th century, it's giddy with steel and glass - such as its arrival hall with a triumphal arch crowned by a grand clock.\n\nPeople are also reading...

For those living in the brave new world of steam engines, journeys that previously took days could be done in hours. Of course, today's trains can be five times faster; that's why the Belgians tunneled under the old station so that bullet trains can zip in and out with only a quick stop.\n\nStepping out of the station, you'll find some modern buildings due to Hitler's rocket attacks during World War II - more V-2s fell on Antwerp than on London. Fortunately, most of the Old Town survived. As it has for centuries, the Cathedral of Our Lady dominates the city center; its 400-foot-tall spire is the tallest structure in the city. The interior is packed with fine artwork, including four paintings by local-boy-made-good Peter Paul Rubens.\n\nNext door, the Grote Markt, Antwerp's main square, is dominated by the looming tower of the cathedral at one end and the stately City Hall at the other. On a facade dating from Antwerp's golden age (16th century), the City Hall flies flags from dozens of countries - representing the importance of international trade to the city.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nOne of the city's top sights is the Rubens House (main collection closed for renovation until 2027, www.rubenshuis.be). This former home of painter Peter Paul Rubens does a fine job of introducing visitors both to the artist's works - several of which are displayed here - and to his lifestyle. There are other places in Antwerp to see Rubens' paintings, but this exhibit offers you a chance to also learn about how he lived and the methods he employed - interesting even to people who think Peter Paul Rubens was the guy who played Pee-wee Herman.\n\nAnother type of house is found in Antwerp's red light district, which is north of the Old Town and near the port. This is Belgium's biggest hub of legalized prostitution and one of the most business-like I've seen in Europe. About four city blocks are pedestrianized and feel almost like a shopping mall. I did notice that, while Antwerp has a slick red light neighborhood, it has almost no sleaze elsewhere in town. This sprawling brothel area is not as sketchy as it might seem - the mayor actually encourages visitors to stroll here. It feels more comfortable to visit during the day, but it's livelier after dark.\n\nThe nearby Museum aan de Stroom (Museum on the River, or MAS for short, www.mas.be), is housed in a 210-foot-tall mod tower, encased in hand-cut red stone, and speckled with silver hands (the symbol of Antwerp). Designed to resemble the spiraling stacks of goods in an old warehouse, its maritime, ethnographic, and folklore collections confirm Antwerp's reputation as a crossroads for the world. Take the bank of escalators to the top for a free, stunning view of the city.\n\nFashionistas love window-shopping in the Sint-Andries district south of the Old Town. Antwerp's status as a fashion mecca is a relatively recent development. In 1988, six students from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts' fashion department traveled to a London show, where they got a lot of attention. Each one opened a shop in Sint-Andries, and now it's one of Europe's top fashion zones.\n\nAs you explore Antwerp, you'll discover that many streets have their own personalities. For example, Schuttershofstraat and Hopland are where you'll find famous-label international couture, while Kammenstraat is better for trendy, retro-hipster fashions.\n\nIf funky urbanity is your thing, Antwerp is one of Europe's most intriguing cities. Compared to stodgy, bureaucratic Brussels, Antwerp's colorful persona respects its storied past even as it embraces its bright future.\n\n(Rick Steves (www.ricksteves.com) writes European guidebooks, hosts travel shows on public TV and radio, and organizes European tours.

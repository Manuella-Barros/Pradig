The slogan is similar to the one held by protesters after US President Donald Trump was elected.\n\nIn her speech, Merkel attempted to defend her policy toward asylum seekers.\n\n\"Many people were worried. They said to themselves: 'What about us? Are we still important or are only the refugees important'?\" she told crowds in the central market square in the town, as cited by Reuters.\n\nShe also hit back at the booing crowd: \"Some want to listen, but others can only shout. That is what separates us.\"\n\nSaxony has been swept by anti-immigration and anti-Muslim protests in recent years, with Pegida staging regular \"Monday walks\" against the government refugee policy and perceived Islamization of Germany.\n\nREAD MORE: Over 200 anti-Muslim incidents so far this year - German authorities\n\n\"I've voted for Merkel in the past, but I can't anymore,\" Reiner Krueger, a 64-year-old retired baker, told Reuters. \"She made a huge mistake with the refugees.

The demonstrators chanted \"Merkel needs to go.\"\n\nMerkel has seen her popularity drop by at least 10 points, according to an Infratest dimap opinion poll published earlier in August. Her approval rating now stands at 59 percent.\n\nGermany received at least 740,000 asylum applications in 2016, the asylumineurope.org website said, citing Germany's Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF). The majority of refugees came from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, according to the website.\n\nMerkel's open door refugee policy has seen numerous protests in Germany since the major migrant influx in 2015. \"Merkel must go!\" has become a popular slogan during such rallies.\n\nA massive wave of outrage swept through Germany after sexual assaults during the 2015 New Year's Eve celebrations in front of Cologne's main train station. Among the identified suspects, at least 18 were asylum seekers from the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nGermany has been also hit by several attacks committed by asylum seekers with links to Islamic State (IS, formerly ISSI/ISIL). In 2016, Syrian refugee Mohammad Daleel blew himself up in the city of Ansbach, Bavaria, injuring at least 15 people.\n\nThe perpetrator behind the W\u00fcrzburg train attack in 2016 was a young refugee from Afghanistan.\n\nIn August last year, the vice-head of the Bavarian department of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Manfred Hauser said, that there was an

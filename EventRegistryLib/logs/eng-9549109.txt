More than 230,000 have been displaced, and much of the region has been isolated by the floodwaters.\n\nMore storms are expected in the state on Wednesday, with hail and wind gusts reaching up to 100 kilometers per hour (62 mph), according to the national meteorology institute's morning bulletin.\n\nStaffers of the state's civil defense agency told The Associated Press they have been struggling to persuade residents of the city of Eldorado do Sul, one of the hardest hit by the floods, to leave their homes. It is located beside Porto Alegre, near the center of the state's coastline. At least four people declined to evacuate.\n\nA flyover of Eldorado do Sul in a military helicopter showed hundreds of houses submerged, with only their roofs visible.

Mayor Ernani de Freitas told local journalists that the city \"will be totally evacuated.\"\n\n\"It will take at least a year to recover,\" he said.\n\nRio Grande do Sul's Gov. Eduardo Leite, speaking at a news conference late Tuesday, appealed to residents to stay out of harm's way, as the anticipated downpour may cause more severe flooding across the state.\n\n\"It isn't the time to return home,\" he said.\n\nThe civil defense agency's own urgent warning asking displaced residents not to return to flooded areas also stressed the risk of disease transmission.\n\nArmy Gen. Marcelo Zucco, one of the coordinators of rescue operations, told the AP his team is working at full speed before heavy rains that are forecast to hit the Porto Alegre area this weekend.

Less than 24 hours later, water started filling her neighborhood in Canoas, now one of the state's most affected cities.\n\n\"My house was inundated,\" Sias recalled, her voice cracking. \"And it was very hard to leave my house, to make my family leave.\" She said she could protect her close family, but not others who insisted on staying put. \"It has been very distressing and still is. I don't know how it will be when I return home.\"\n\nAuthorities in southern Brazil rushed Wednesday to rescue survivors of massive flooding that has killed at least 100 people, but some residents refused to leave belongings behind while others returned to evacuated homes despite the risk of new storms.\n\nHeavy rains and flooding in Rio Grande do Sul since last week also have left 130 people missing, authorities said. More than 230,000 have been displaced, and much of the region has been isolated by the floodwaters.\n\nStorms were expected in the state on Wednesday evening, with hail and wind gusts reaching up to 60 kilometers per hour (37 mph), according to the national meteorology institute's afternoon bulletin. And the institute forecasts a cold front this weekend with additional rains, to be particularly intense in the state's north and east.\n\nIn Porto Alegre, about 300 people were sheltering at the local club Gremio Nautico Uniao, based in the upscale, little-harmed neighborhood of Moinhos de Vento. Dozens lay on mattresses as volunteers brought boxes filled with feijoada -- a typical Brazilian bean-and-pork stew.\n\nHeitor da Silva was among them, having heeded authorities' warnings. Still, he's anxious about his future.\n\n\"I only took my documents, three shirts, two pieces of underwear and my flip-flops. All the rest is gone,\" said da Silva, 68. \"I already had very little, but that stayed there. When I go home, there will be nothing. Then what?\"\n\nStaffers of the state's civil defense agency told The Associated Press they have been struggling to persuade residents of the city of Eldorado do Sul, one of the hardest hit by the floods, to leave their homes. It is located beside Porto Alegre, near the center of the state's coastline.

That's bringing water, medication, food and transportation for the sick to some hospital,\" the general added.\n\nHe also said some improvement in conditions for the day helped his men finally access some areas by land.\n\nUnusually heavy rains have also inundated parts of Uruguay, causing rivers to overflow in the country's east and displacing nearly 1,000 people, authorities said, with rescuers reporting that they had evacuated 200 stranded people, helped by the army. There were no immediate reports of casualties, but the rescue service said flash floods had damaged over a dozen roads and left thousands of people without electricity.\n\nOver the weekend, rain in northern Rio Grande do Sul could prompt renewed swelling of rivers that are already causing widespread flooding around the Patos lagoon, where the Porto Alegre municipal region is located, said Sias, the meteorologist in Rio Grande do Sul, who works for a forecasting service based there.\n\n\"We will remain on this level of alert at least until the end of the month,\" she said.\n\nA report by the National Confederation of Municipalities estimates damages at 4.6 billion reais ($930 million) in nearly 80% of Rio Grande do Sul's municipalities.\n\nGov.

Less than 24 hours later, water started filling her neighborhood in Canoas, now one of the state's most affected cities.\n\n\"My house was inundated,\" Sias recalled, her voice cracking. \"And it was very hard to leave my house, to make my family leave.\" She said she could protect her close family, but not others who insisted on staying put. \"It has been very distressing and still is. I don't know how it will be when I return home.\"\n\nAuthorities in southern Brazil rushed Wednesday to rescue survivors of massive flooding that has killed at least 100 people, but some residents refused to leave belongings behind while others returned to evacuated homes despite the risk of new storms.\n\nHeavy rains and flooding in Rio Grande do Sul since last week also have left 130 people missing, authorities said. More than 230,000 have been displaced, and much of the region has been isolated by the floodwaters.\n\nStorms were expected in the state on Wednesday evening, with hail and wind gusts reaching up to 60 kilometers per hour (37 mph), according to the national meteorology institute's afternoon bulletin. And the institute forecasts a cold front this weekend with additional rains, to be particularly intense in the state's north and east.\n\nIn Porto Alegre, about 300 people were sheltering at the local club Gremio Nautico Uniao, based in the upscale, little-harmed neighborhood of Moinhos de Vento. Dozens lay on mattresses as volunteers brought boxes filled with feijoada -- a typical Brazilian bean-and-pork stew.\n\nHeitor da Silva was among them, having heeded authorities' warnings. Still, he's anxious about his future.\n\n\"I only took my documents, three shirts, two pieces of underwear and my flip-flops. All the rest is gone,\" said da Silva, 68. \"I already had very little, but that stayed there. When I go home, there will be nothing. Then what?\"\n\nStaffers of the state's civil defense agency told The Associated Press they have been struggling to persuade residents of the city of Eldorado do Sul, one of the hardest hit by the floods, to leave their homes. It is located beside Porto Alegre, near the center of the state's coastline. At least four people declined to evacuate.\n\nA flyover of Eldorado do Sul in a military helicopter showed hundreds of houses submerged, with only their roofs visible. Residents were using small boards, surfboards and personal watercraft to move around. Mayor Ernani de Freitas told local journalists that the city \"will be totally evacuated.\"\n\n\"It will take at least a year to recover,\" he said.\n\nRio Grande do Sul's Gov. Eduardo Leite, speaking at a news conference late Tuesday, appealed to residents to stay out of harm's way, as the anticipated downpour may cause more severe flooding across the state.\n\n\"It isn't the time to return home,\" he said.\n\nThe civil defense agency's own urgent warning asking displaced residents not to return to flooded areas also stressed the risk of disease transmission.\n\nArmy Gen. Marcelo Zucco, one of the coordinators of rescue operations, told the AP his team is working at full speed before heavy rains that are forecast to hit the Porto Alegre area this weekend. Moderate rain was falling Wednesday afternoon in the city.\n\n\"We hope the next rains are not like those we saw, but there's no way to be sure there won't be trouble ahead of us,\" Zucco said.\n\n\"At this moment we are focusing on finishing rescue operations and starting logistical support to the population. That's bringing water, medication, food and transportation for the sick to some hospital,\" the general added.\n\nHe also said some improvement in conditions for the day helped his men finally access some areas by land.\n\nUnusually heavy rains have also inundated parts of Uruguay, causing rivers to overflow in the country's east and displacing nearly 1,000 people, authorities said, with rescuers reporting that they had evacuated 200 stranded people, helped by the army. There were no immediate reports of casualties, but the rescue service said flash floods had damaged over a dozen roads and left thousands of people without electricity.\n\nOver the weekend, rain in northern Rio Grande do Sul could prompt renewed swelling of rivers that are already causing widespread flooding around the Patos lagoon, where the Porto Alegre municipal region is located, said Sias, the meteorologist in Rio Grande do Sul, who works for a forecasting service based there.\n\n\"We will remain on this level of alert at least until the end of the month,\" she said.\n\nA report by the National Confederation of Municipalities estimates damages at 4.6 billion reais ($930 million) in nearly 80% of Rio Grande do Sul's municipalities.\n\nGov. Leite has said that the enormous impact will require something akin to the Marshall Plan for Europe's post-WWII recovery. Already the state has asked the federal government to suspend debt payments and create a fund for the southern region.\n\nOn Tuesday, Congress passed a decree declaring a state of calamity in Rio Grande do Sul until the end of the year, allowing the federal government to quickly allocate money to mitigate the catastrophe and rebuild regions affected by the floods, bypassing a spending cap. The vote united supporters and opponents of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva's government.\n\n\"There is no limit to the public spending necessary to resolve the problem of the calamity that

More than 230,000 have been displaced, and much of the region has been isolated by the floodwaters.\n\nMore storms are expected in the state on Wednesday, with hail and wind gusts reaching up to 100 kilometers per hour (62 mph), according to the national meteorology institute's morning bulletin.\n\nStaffers of the state's civil defense agency told The Associated Press they have been struggling to persuade residents of the city of Eldorado do Sul, one of the hardest hit by the floods, to leave their homes. It is located beside Porto Alegre, near the center of the state's coastline. At least four people declined to evacuate.\n\nA flyover of Eldorado do Sul in a military helicopter showed hundreds of houses submerged, with only their roofs visible. Residents were using small boards, surfboards and personal watercraft to move around. Mayor Ernani de Freitas told local journalists that the city \"will be totally evacuated.\"\n\n\"It will take at least a year to recover,\" he said.\n\nRio Grande do Sul's Gov. Eduardo Leite, speaking at a news conference late Tuesday, appealed to residents to stay out of harm's way, as the anticipated downpour may cause more severe flooding across the state.\n\n\"It isn't the time to return home,\" he said.\n\nThe civil defense agency's own urgent warning asking displaced residents not to return to flooded areas also stressed the risk of disease transmission.\n\nArmy Gen. Marcelo Zucco, one of the coordinators of rescue operations, told the AP his team is working at full speed before heavy rains that are forecast to hit the Porto Alegre area this weekend. Moderate rain was falling Wednesday afternoon in the city.\n\n\"We hope the next rains are not like those we saw, but there's no way to be sure there won't be trouble ahead of us,\" Zucco said.\n\n\"At this moment we are focusing on finishing rescue operations and starting logistical support to the population. That's bringing water, medication, food and transportation for the sick to some hospital,\" the general added.\n\nHe also said some improvement in conditions for the day helped his men finally access some areas by land.\n\nOver the weekend, rain in northern Rio Grande do Sul could prompt renewed swelling of rivers that are already causing widespread flooding around the Patos lagoon, where the Porto Alegre municipal region is located, Estael Sias, a meteorologist at a Rio Grande do Sul-based forecasting service, told The Associated Press.\n\n\"We will remain on this level of alert at least until the end of the month,\" she said.\n\nA report by the National Confederation of Municipalities estimates damages at 4.6 billion reais ($930 million) in nearly 80% of Rio Grande do Sul's municipalities.\n\nGov.

More than 230,000 have been displaced, and much of the region has been isolated by the floodwaters.\n\nStorms were expected in the state on Wednesday evening, with hail and wind gusts reaching up to 37 mph, according to the National Meteorology Institute's afternoon bulletin. The institute forecasts a cold front this weekend with additional rains, to be particularly intense in the state's north and east.\n\nRelated Floods in southern Brazil kill at least 60, with 101 people missing\n\nIn capital Porto Alegre, about 300 people were sheltering at the local club Gremio Nautico Uniao, based in the upscale, little-harmed neighborhood of Moinhos de Vento. Dozens lay on mattresses as volunteers brought boxes filled with feijoada - a typical Brazilian bean-and-pork stew.\n\nHeitor da Silva was among them, having heeded authorities' warnings. Still, he's anxious about his future.\n\n\"I only took my documents, three shirts, two pieces of underwear and my flip-flops. All the rest is gone,\" said da Silva, 68. \"I already had very little, but that stayed there. When I go home, there will be nothing. Then what?\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStaffers of the state's civil defense agency told the Associated Press they have been struggling to persuade residents of the city of Eldorado do Sul, one of the hardest hit by the floods, to leave their homes. It is located beside Porto Alegre, near the center of the state's coastline. At least four people declined to evacuate.\n\nA flyover of Eldorado do Sul in a military helicopter showed hundreds of houses submerged, with only their roofs visible. Residents were using small boards, surfboards and personal watercraft to move around. Mayor Ernani de Freitas told local journalists that the city \"will be totally evacuated.\"\n\n\"It will take at least a year to recover,\" he said.\n\nRio Grande do Sul's Gov. Eduardo Leite, speaking at a news conference late Tuesday, appealed to residents to stay out of harm's way, as the anticipated downpour may cause more severe flooding across the state.\n\n\"It isn't the time to return home,\" he said.\n\nThe Gremio Arena and surrounding area are flooded after heavy rain in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil on Wednesday. Andre Penner/Associated Press\n\nThe civil defense agency's own urgent warning asking displaced residents not to return to flooded areas also stressed the risk of disease transmission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArmy Gen. Marcelo Zucco, one of the coordinators of rescue operations, told the AP his team is working at full speed before heavy rains that are forecast to hit the Porto Alegre area this weekend. Moderate rain was falling Wednesday afternoon in the city.\n\n\"We hope the next rains are not like those we saw, but there's no way to be sure there won't be trouble ahead of us,\" Zucco said.\n\n\"At this moment we are focusing on finishing rescue operations and starting logistical support to the population. That's bringing water, medication, food and transportation for the sick to some hospital,\" the general added.\n\nHe also said some improvement in conditions for the day helped his men finally access some areas by land.\n\nUnusually heavy rains have also inundated parts of Uruguay, causing rivers to overflow in the country's east and displacing nearly 1,000 people, authorities said, with rescuers reporting that they had evacuated 200 stranded people, helped by the army. There were no immediate reports of casualties, but the rescue service said flash floods had damaged over a dozen roads and left thousands of people without electricity.\n\nOver the weekend, rain in northern Rio Grande do Sul could prompt renewed swelling of rivers that are already causing widespread flooding around the Patos lagoon, where the Porto Alegre municipal region is located, Estael Sias, a meteorologist at a Rio Grande do Sul-based forecasting service, told The Associated Press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We will remain on this level of alert at least until the end of the month,\" she said.\n\nThe meteorologist herself has been forced from her home. As major floods engulfed entire cities in the northern part of the state last week, Sias knew the water would drain into Porto Alegre's metropolitan region and that she would need to find a safe place. Last Friday, she, her husband, three children, and two dogs left everything behind. Less than 24 hours later, water started filling her neighborhood in Canoas, now one of the state's most affected cities.\n\n\"My house was inundated,\" Sias recalled, her voice cracking. \"And it was very hard to leave my house, to make my family leave.\" She said she could protect her close family, but not others who insisted on staying put. \"It has been very distressing and still is. I don't know how it will be when I return home.\"\n\nA report by the National Confederation of Municipalities estimates damages at $930 million in nearly 80% of Rio Grande do Sul's municipalities.\n\nGov. Leite has said that the enormous impact will require something akin to the Marshall Plan for Europe's post-WWII recovery. Already the state has asked the federal government to suspend debt payments and create a fund for the southern region.\n\nOn Tuesday, Congress passed a decree declaring a state of calamity in Rio Grande do Sul until the end of the year, allowing the federal government to quickly allocate money to mitigate the catastrophe and rebuild regions affected by the floods, bypassing a spending cap. The vote united supporters and opponents of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva's government.\n\n\"There is no limit to the public spending necessary to resolve the problem of the calamity that today is ravaging Rio Grande do Sul state,\" Planning and Budget Minister Simone Tebet told Radio Gaucha in an interview.\n\nAssociated Press videojournalist Lucas Dumphreys contributed from Porto Alegre and writer Isabel DeBre from Buenos Aires..\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines Floods in southern Brazil kill at least 60, with 101 people missing\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

More than 230,000 have been displaced, and much of the region has been isolated by the floodwaters.\n\nStorms were expected in the state on Wednesday evening, with hail and wind gusts reaching up to 60 kilometers per hour (37 mph), according to the national meteorology institute's afternoon bulletin. And the institute forecasts a cold front this weekend with additional rains, to be particularly intense in the state's north and east.\n\nIn capital Porto Alegre, about 300 people were sheltering at the local club Gremio Nautico Uniao, based in the upscale, little-harmed neighborhood of Moinhos de Vento. Dozens lay on mattresses as volunteers brought boxes filled with feijoada -- a typical Brazilian bean-and-pork stew.\n\nHeitor da Silva was among them, having heeded authorities' warnings. Still, he's anxious about his future.\n\n\"I only took my documents, three shirts, two pieces of underwear and my flip-flops.

There were no immediate reports of casualties, but the rescue service said flash floods had damaged over a dozen roads and left thousands of people without electricity.\n\nOver the weekend, rain in northern Rio Grande do Sul could prompt renewed swelling of rivers that are already causing widespread flooding around the Patos lagoon, where the Porto Alegre municipal region is located, Estael Sias, a meteorologist at a Rio Grande do Sul-based forecasting service, told The Associated Press.\n\n\"We will remain on this level of alert at least until the end of the month,\" she said.\n\nThe meteorologist herself has been forced from her home. As major floods engulfed entire cities in the northern part of the state last week, Sias knew the water would drain into Porto Alegre's metropolitan region and that she would need to find a safe place. Last Friday, she, her husband, three children, and two dogs left everything behind. Less than 24 hours later, water started filling her neighborhood in Canoas, now one of the state's most affected cities.\n\n\"My house was inundated,\" Sias recalled, her voice cracking. \"And it was very hard to leave my house, to make my family leave.\" She said she could protect her close family, but not others who insisted on staying put. \"It has been very distressing and still is.

More than 230,000 have been displaced, and much of the region has been isolated by the floodwaters.\n\nMore storms are expected in the state, with lightning strikes and wind gusts reaching up to 100 kilometers per hour (62 mph) in the south, according to C\u00e1tia Valente, the meteorologist in the state's situation room.\n\nStaffers of the state's civil defense agency told The Associated Press they have been struggling to persuade residents of the city of Eldorado do Sul, one of the hardest hit by the floods, to leave their homes. It is located beside Porto Alegre, near the center of the state's coastline. At least four people declined to evacuate.\n\nA flyover of Eldorado do Sul in a military helicopter showed hundreds of houses submerged, with only their roofs visible. Residents were using small boards, surfboards and personal watercraft to move around. Mayor Ernani de Freitas told local journalists that the city \"will be totally evacuated.\"\n\n\"It will take at least a year to recover,\" he said.\n\nRio Grande do Sul's Gov.

Moderate rain was falling Wednesday afternoon in the city.\n\n\"We hope the next rains are not like those we saw, but there's no way to be sure there won't be trouble ahead of us,\" Zucco said.\n\n\"At this moment we are focusing on finishing rescue operations and starting logistical support to the population.

And what is causing the deadly floods in Brazil?\n\nMajor floods engulfed entire cities in the northern part of the Brazil's Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nMore than 230,000 have been displaced, and much of the region has been isolated by the floodwaters.\n\nAs per BBC, Rio Grande do Sul has suffered its worst-ever natural calamity.\n\nAround 1.4 million people have been impacted by the floods.\n\nAt least 95 people have died and more than 130 are still missing.\n\nStorms were expected in the state on Wednesday evening, with hail and wind gusts reaching up to 60 kilometres per hour, according to the national meteorology institute's afternoon bulletin.\n\nAnd the institute forecasts a cold front this weekend with additional rains, to be particularly intense in the state's north and east.\n\nIn Porto Alegre, about 300 people were sheltering at the local club Gremio Nautico Uniao, based in the upscale, little-harmed neighbourhood of Moinhos de Vento. Dozens lay on mattresses as volunteers brought boxes filled with feijoada -- a typical Brazilian bean-and-pork stew.\n\nHeitor da Silva was among them, having heeded authorities' warnings. Still, he's anxious about his future.\n\n\"I only took my documents, three shirts, two pieces of underwear and my flip-flops. All the rest is gone,\" said da Silva, 68. \"I already had very little, but that stayed there. When I go home, there will be nothing. Then what?\"\n\nThe mayor of Porto Alegre has begged residents to observe with his water rationing decree.\n\nFour-fifths of the population remains without running water\n\nSuzan, a resident of the capital, told BBC the city had \"never experienced anything like it.\"\n\n\"There are thousands of people who lost their houses. Now we don't have water anywhere,\" she said.\n\n\"My mother-in-law is 90 years old and she had to be carried by the rescuers. It's unbelievable what is going on here,\" she added.\n\nStaffers of the state's civil defence agency told The Associated Press they have been struggling to persuade residents of the city of Eldorado do Sul, one of the hardest hit by the floods, to leave their homes.\n\nIt is located beside Porto Alegre, near the center of the state's coastline. At least four people declined to evacuate.\n\nAuthorities, meanwhile, urged people not to return to affected areas due to possible landslide and health hazards.\n\n\"Contaminated water can transmit diseases,\" civil defense spokeswoman Sabrina Ribas said.\n\nThe National Confederation of Municipalities said nearly 100,000 homes had been damaged or destroyed by unprecedented rains and floods in the state, with losses estimated at over $900 million.\n\nPorto Alegre is home to some 1.4 million people and the larger metropolitan area has more than double that number.\n\nThe state's Guaiba River, which runs through Porto Alegre, reached historic levels and officials warned Tuesday that five dams were at risk of rupturing.\n\nA flyover of Eldorado do Sul in a military helicopter showed hundreds of houses submerged, with only their roofs visible.

We need to see in advance what calamities might happen and we need to work.\"\n\nAne Alencar, science director for the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, told the Associated Press last year that the oscillating pattern of extreme drought-extreme rain was likely \"the new normal.\"\n\nThe record-setting Brazil heat that stifled huge cites such as Sao Paulo also kept a rainstorm from moving over the country's south, turning it deadly, according to Francisco Aquino, a climatologist at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nThere also was a massive influx of humidity from the Amazon's so-called flying rivers, or air currents that carry water vapor, Aquino explained.\n\n\"These caused clouds to generate extreme rainfall,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, much recovery work needs to be done.\n\nA report by the National Confederation of Municipalities estimates damages at $930 million in nearly 80 per cent of Rio Grande do Sul's municipalities.\n\nGovernor Leite has said that the enormous impact will require something akin to the Marshall Plan for Europe's post-WWII recovery.

More than 230,000 have been displaced, and much of the region has been isolated by the floodwaters.\n\nAlso Read | India Will Offer Alternative To China for Investors With PM Narendra Modi, Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani Reshaping Nation to Become Economic Superpower, Reports CNN.\n\nMore storms are expected in the state, with lightning strikes and wind gusts reaching up to 100 kilometers per hour (62 mph) in the south, according to C\u00e1tia Valente, the meteorologist in the state's situation room.\n\nStaffers of the state's civil defense agency told The Associated Press they have been struggling to persuade residents of the city of Eldorado do Sul, one of the hardest hit by the floods, to leave their homes. It is located beside Porto Alegre, near the center of the state's coastline. At least four people declined to evacuate.\n\nAlso Read | Israel-Gaza Conflict: Israel Reopens Kerem Shalom Border Crossing for Delivery of Aid to War-Torn Nation.\n\nA flyover of Eldorado do Sul in a military helicopter showed hundreds of houses submerged, with only their roofs visible. Residents were using small boards, surfboards and personal watercraft to move around. Mayor Ernani de Freitas told local journalists that the city \"will be totally evacuated.\"\n\n\"It will take at least a year to recover,\" he said.\n\nRio Grande do Sul's Gov. Eduardo Leite, speaking at a news conference late Tuesday, appealed to residents to stay out of harm's way, as the anticipated downpour may cause more severe flooding across the state.\n\n\"It isn't the time to return home,\" he said.\n\nThe civil defense agency's own urgent warning asking displaced residents not to return to flooded areas also stressed the risk of disease transmission.\n\nArmy Gen. Marcelo Zucco, one of the coordinators of rescue operations, told the AP his team is working at full speed before heavy rains that are forecast to hit the Porto Alegre area this weekend. Moderate rain was falling Wednesday afternoon in the city.\n\n\"We hope the next rains are not like those we saw, but there's no way to be sure there won't be trouble ahead of us,\" Zucco said.\n\n\"At this moment we are focusing on finishing rescue operations and starting logistical support to the population. That's bringing water, medication, food and transportation for the sick to some hospital,\" the general added.\n\nHe also said some improvement in conditions for the day helped his men finally access some areas by land.\n\nA report by the National Confederation of Municipalities estimates damages at 4.6 billion reais (USD 930 million) in nearly 80% of Rio Grande do Sul's municipalities.\n\nGov. Leite has said that the enormous impact will require something akin to the Marshall Plan for Europe's post-WWII recovery. Already the state has asked the federal government to suspend debt payments and create a fund for the southern region.\n\nOn Tuesday, Congress passed a decree declaring a state of calamity in Rio Grande do Sul until the end of the year, allowing the federal government to quickly allocate money to mitigate the catastrophe and rebuild regions affected by the floods, bypassing a spending cap. The vote united supporters and opponents of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva's government.\n\n\"There is no limit to the public spending necessary to resolve the problem of the calamity that today is ravaging Rio Grande do Sul state,\" Planning and Budget Minister Simone Tebet told Radio Gaucho in an interview.

The state's main airport has been inundated by water and could be out of use for at least 30 days.\n\nOfficials have said it is the \"worst natural calamity\" to hit the state.\n\nIn Porto Alegre, the capital city of Rio Grande do Sul, several water plants have stopped functioning leaving an estimated 80 per cent of the population without access to drinking water.

In Porto Alegre, police have been providing volunteers with security patrols using boats and even jet skis.\n\nThousands are still waiting to be evacuated and officials have called for anyone who owns \"any kind of boat\" to offer it to emergency teams. Around 15,000 soldiers, firefighters, police and volunteers are working to rescue people and transport aid.\n\nBrazilian Paralympic fencer Vanderson Chaves is one of those impacted by the disaster.

The waters washed away his equipment, dozens of medals, his passport and may even have thwarted his chances of reaching the Paris Games in September. He has also been displaced by the flooding.\n\n\"I come from an impoverished area of Porto Alegre. Everything for me is more difficult to achieve. I am Black, I am disabled. And now this.\"\n\nResidents are also reportedly facing shortages of essential supplies including drinking water. In many places, access for supply trucks or employees is completely cut off.\n\nDownpours started on 29 April with more than 300 millimetres of rain falling in less than a week, according to Brazil's National Institute of Meteorology (INMET). Flooding started in the north of the state and then subsequently inundated more southerly cities including Porto Alegre.\n\nIt is the fourth environmental disaster Rio Grande do Sul has seen in a year after flooding hit in July, September and November of 2023.\n\nStill reeling from massive flooding, the state now faces the possibility of further storms. Brazil's national centre for natural disasters has warned the region is at \"high risk\" of more flooding. Weather forecaster MetSul said Rio Grande do Sul could face \"very large\" floods of \"serious proportions\".\n\nOn Wednesday, Porto Alegre officials warned civilian rescuers to halt their operations because of forecasts for rain, lightning and strong winds. INMET has also forecast a cold front this weekend with additional rains which will be particularly intense in the north and east of the state.\n\nArmy General Marcelo Zucco, one of the coordinators of rescue operations, told AP that his team were working at full speed before heavy rains that are forecast to hit the Porto Alegre area this weekend. Some improvement in conditions had helped his tea finally access some areas by land on Wednesday but more rain started to fall on the city that afternoon.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Region,_Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Region, Brazil"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landslide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.D._Chaves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "G.D.

Tiago Franco, a firefighter from Sao Paulo deployed to lead the rescue, was quoted as saying in a statement from that state\u00b4s security secretariat. \"We tried to approach in a calm way.\"\n\nFirefighters and veterinarians climbed onto the partially submerged roof, sedated and immobilized the horse and then lay it on an inflatable raft - all 770 pounds of it. The operation involved four inflatable boats and four support vessels, with firefighters, soldiers and other volunteers.\n\nThe rescue was broadcast live on television networks that filmed from their helicopters. Social media influencer Felipe Neto sent out updates to his almost 17 million followers on X as the rescue was underway. Afterwards, he offered to adopt it.\n\nFirefighters use a raft to transport a horse after rescuing it from a roof, where it was trapped for days amid flooding, after heavy rain in Canoas, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, Thursday, May 9, 2024.

My God, what happiness,\" he wrote.\n\nPresident Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva's wife, Janja, posted a video of herself sharing the good news with the Brazilian leader, whispering into his ear at an official event. He smiled, gave a thumbs up and hugged her to him. Rio Grande do Sul's Gov. Eduardo Leite also celebrated the rescue, posting on X: \"All lives matter, we stand firm!\"\n\nThe stranded horse is just one of many animals rescue workers have been striving to save in recent days. Rio Grande do Sul state agents have rescued about 10,000 animals since last week, while those in municipalities and volunteers have saved thousands more, according to the state's housing secretariat.\n\nAnimal protection groups and volunteers have been sharing images of difficult rescues and heartwarming scenes of pets reuniting with their owners on social media. One video that went viral shows a man crying inside a boat, hugging his four dogs after rescuers went back to his home to save them.\n\nHeavy rains and flooding in Rio Grande do Sul have killed at least 107 people. Another 136 are reported missing and more than 230,000 have been displaced, according to state authorities. There is no official tally for the number of animals that have been killed or are missing, but local media have estimated the number is in the thousands.\n\nCarla Sassi, chairwoman of Grad, a Brazilian nonprofit that rescues animals after disasters, said she is meeting with state government officials in Canoas to discuss emergency measures to rescue pets.\n\nS\u00e1 Pessoa reported from S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nThe area near the Guaiba River is flooded after heavy rain in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, Thursday, May 9, 2024.

More than 230,000 have been displaced, and much of the region has been isolated by the floodwaters.\n\nStorms were expected in the state on Wednesday evening, with hail and wind gusts reaching up to 60 kilometres per hour (37 mph), according to the national meteorology institute's afternoon bulletin. And the institute forecasts a cold front this weekend with additional rains, to be particularly intense in the state's north and east.\n\nIn capital Porto Alegre, about 300 people were sheltering at the local club Gremio Nautico Uniao, based in the upscale, little-harmed neighbourhood of Moinhos de Vento.

At least four people declined to evacuate.\n\nA flyover of Eldorado do Sul in a military helicopter showed hundreds of houses submerged, with only their roofs visible. Residents were using small boards, surfboards and personal watercraft to move around. Mayor Ernani de Freitas told local journalists that the city \"will be totally evacuated\".\n\n\"It will take at least a year to recover,\" he said.\n\nRio Grande do Sul's Gov Eduardo Leite, speaking at a news conference late Tuesday, appealed to residents to stay out of harm's way, as the anticipated downpour may cause more severe flooding across the state.", "source": {"uri": "jamaica-gleaner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jamaica Gleaner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Region,_Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Region, Brazil"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canoas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canoas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feijoada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Feijoada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clube_N\u00e1utico_Capibaribe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clube N\u00e1utico Capibaribe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stew", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_front", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cold front"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr\u00eamio_Foot-Ball_Porto_Alegrense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gr\u00eamio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meteorology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_watercraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal watercraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Leite", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Leite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surfboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldorado_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eldorado do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eldorado do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Home/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2024/05/09/2776298/7938991.jpg?itok=RZLAcNwH", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549109", "eventUri": "eng-9549109", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Observers say the true impact of the floods that have displaced more than 156,000 people and affected more than 1.3 million is not likely to be known for weeks.\n\nThe floods have wreaked havoc across nearly 350 out of 497 cities in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, critically damaging infrastructure, including roads, bridges and causing the partial collapse of a dam at a hydroelectric plant. More than 100 people are known to have been killed and at least 131 are still missing, according to information from the civil defense force involved in disaster relief.\n\nPresident Inacio Lula da Silva, commonly known as Lula, declared a state of emergency, echoing the sentiments of Rio Grande do Sul Governor Eduardo Leite, who ominously predicted a substantial rise in the death toll as rescue missions expand their reach, and said the \"scenes are out of a war\", in comments over the weekend.\n\n\"We ... knew that heavy and intense rains would come, but we never imagined this magnitude,\" Marcelo Schneider, a meteorologist and district coordinator for Meteorology for southern Brazil at the National Institute of Meteorology (Inmet), told China Daily.\n\n\"The warnings were there,\" Schneider said. \"One of the main factors is the intersection of two events: the El Nino and La Nina phenomena.\"\n\nWhile heavy rain is not unusual in this part of Brazil, the sheer amount that fell over the past few days has been historic.\n\nInmet first alerted about upcoming heavy rains on April 26, warning of 100 mm of rain over the following weekend and winds in excess of 70 km/h. MetSul Meteorologica, a meteorological monitoring entity, also warned of severe risks of flooding. In the last few days of the month, the state received roughly 70 percent of the rain it usually receives in whole month, and the downpours continued into May.\n\n\"Despite improvements in parts of the state, some areas will remain under severe conditions for a very long time,\" MetSul said in a statement, noting that the waters had changed the urban landscape of Porto Alegre, the largest city in the Rio Grande do Sul state.\n\nInmet warned this week that rains would continue in the southernmost part of the state, with the downpour likely to exceed 150 mm by the morning of April 8 in some areas.\n\nAuthorities are now worried about drinking water running out.\n\nIt may have been \"the worst meteorological catastrophe\" in the state's history, said Paulo Pimenta, Lula's press secretary.\n\nRobson Cardoch Valdez, an economist and professor of international relations at the Brazilian Institute of Education, Development and Research, said the ramifications of this natural disaster extend beyond the immediate threat to lives.\n\nValdez, who works as an advisor to the Rio Grande do Sul government, suggested that the economic tremors of the devastation could ripple through the country for years, particularly in sectors like agriculture and oil production.\n\nThe floods have disrupted business operations, with some airports suspending flights and train services also disrupted. The extensive damage to infrastructure means a laborious and costly road to recovery.\n\n\"Once the water recedes, it will be possible to have a more specific (idea) of the economic impact of the rain, but ... at this moment we are only working with estimates ... to assist in everything necessary to rebuild the physical structure of Rio Grande do Sul,\" Valdez told China Daily.\n\nThe rebuilding could take some time. More rain is expected in the coming days and could get heavy again between May 10 and 15, according to MetSul.\n\nAdding to the complexity of the recovery, Rio Grande do Sul, a key agricultural hub, is bracing for a spike in the prices of staple crops and potential inflationary pressures on food products as a result of the floods.\n\nValdez highlighted the anticipated impact on agriculture, an industry critical to Rio Grande do Sul state and Brazil as a whole. The floods will likely impact crop production and livestock rearing and are expected to lead to an uptick in the prices of rice, corn, tomatoes and beef, among other staples.\n\nThe expected inflation, coupled with the costs associated with the extensive rebuilding of the state's physical infrastructure, presents a multifaceted challenge for federal and state authorities.\n\nThe massive floods came just seven months after an extratropical cyclone hit the region with heavy rains that caused floods and killed dozens.", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title":

Many of the 8,000 indigenous people directly impacted have lost their homes and all their possessions. Such reserves of food they had have run out. Particularly badly affected have been those living in the state capital, Porto Alegre.\n\nStarting on April 29, the latest floods followed just one month after the previous spate of heavy rain, the source reports.\n\nClose to 90 -- or 80% -- of the state's municipalities have reported flooding, according to the same source earlier this week. The confirmed death toll at that time was 90, with more than 130 people still missing.\n\nBrazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has announced the release of emergency federal government funding for Rio Grande do Sul. After this initial \"first-aid\" funding, he committed to further support after discussion with the state's governor, reported Ag\u00eancia Brasil.\n\nTen poultry and pig farms in Rio Grande do Sul were known to have completely or partially suspended production due to the effects of flooding, according to the Brazilian Association of Animal Protein, ABPA. Some of the premises were rendered completely out of action, while others were facing extreme operational challenges due to difficulties linked to the transport of the workforce, inputs, and animals. For many more, water, electricity and communication systems have failed.\n\nFor ABPA, the first priorities were to save lives and provide essential supplies for those who have lost their livelihoods -- followed by providing feed and care to the flood-affected poultry and swine. With the impacts spread so widely across the state, ABPA expressed concerns about the food supply to the population of Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nThe state accounts for around 20% of Brazil's total pork production, and 11% of its poultry meat. According to ABPA, residents could have to wait at least 30 days for normal production to resume.", "source": {"uri": "wattagnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WATTAgNet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ag\u00eancia_Brasil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ag\u00eancia Brasil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Region,_Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Region, Brazil"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In\u00e1cio_Lula_da_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pork"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Home/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://img.wattagnet.com/files/base/wattglobalmedia/all/image/2024/05/brazil_map.663cd12454589.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549109", "eventUri": "eng-9549109", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 814, "textEnd": 822}], "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

We manage your personal data in accordance with our privacy policy.\n\nUnprecedented floods in Brazil's southern Rio Grande do Sul state are expected to create even more chaotic logistics situation in the country and could cut fertilizer usage for 2024-25 soybean crop in the state.\n\nHeavy rainfall has hit the state since 29 April, culminating in the worst floods ever registered in Rio Grande do Sul. The floods have reached the central part of the state, closing the ports of Pelotas and Porto Alegre, which both handle agricultural commodities, including grains, oilseeds and fertilizers. The high waters are expected to move south, reaching Rio Grande port.\n\nThe three Rio Grande do Sul ports handled about 44.8mn metric tonnes (t) in 2023, with the larger Rio Grande port accounting for at least 42.6mn t, according to port data.\n\nThe state's geographic layout and a particularly narrow channel for floodwaters to reach the sea suggests the worst is yet to come in the southern part of the state. Water levels are about to increase in the Lagoa dos Patos, a lagoon that receives water from many rivers and flows to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nBut operations are running normally in the Rio Grande port as of 9 May. The national association of cereal exporters Anec project that 343,250 t of soybeans and 131,778 t of soymeal will be shipped in the week ended 11 May, according to port schedule data. Shipments between 28 April and 4 May -- which account for the days where rainfall reached its peak and the state began to flood -- totaled 183,559t and 133,424t for soybean and soymeal, respectively.\n\nLineup data from maritime agency Williams predicts that soybean exports may total 838,600t, nearly doubling the volumes from the forecast a week ago. The estimated average waiting time for shipping rose to just three days from the two days projected on 29 April. The Rio Grande port was the fifth largest soybean exporter in 2023, with 3.8mn t shipped last year, according to the National Waterway Transportation Agency (Antaq).\n\nWaiting time for discharge fertilizers is at around one day, unchanged from the previous week. Rio Grande port was third in terms of fertilizer import volumes in the first quarter 2024, according to lineup data from maritime agency Unimar. Paranagua, in Parana state, received 2mn t of fertilizers, followed by Santos port and Rio Grande, with 1.9mn t and 990,640t, respectively.\n\nLineup data for May and June suggest that Rio Grande is about to receive 540,900t and 66,375t of fertilizers, respectively. Vessels lined-up for Rio Grande may be diverted to other ports, specially for Sao Francisco do Sul, in Santa Catarina state, and Paranagua according to market participants.\n\nEven if fertilizer volumes would be discharged as initially planned, the flow to agriculture producing areas would be compromised. The main access to the port, the BR-116 roadway, is already partially blocked, hampering truck flows in the state.\n\nDrivers have already been searching for short-stretches to move goods, as long-stretches force them to look for longer alternatives, considering there are around 88 partial and full road blockages in the state as of 9 May.\n\nLogistics company Rumo also partially interrupted operations in Rio Grande do Sul state on 6 May. The company has a grain terminal in Rio Grande port and a rail network of around 7,220km in Brazil's South region, which includes Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Parana states.\n\nFertilizer companies that operate in Rio Grande do Sul are reportedly trying to move their product to warehouses away from the rivers. Considering the agricultural production, volumes that had already been sowed and were in silos are now soaked. With more damage expected to be measured farmers in Rio Grande do Sul may be discouraged from investing in technology and fertilizers for the upcoming 2024-25 soybean crop.\n\nBrazil's national meteorological institute Inmet expects rainfall to intensify once again in Rio Grande do Sul starting this Friday between the state's center-north and west portions.\n\nRain levels are expected to subside by 12 May, but may surpass 100mm before then.\n\nThe coastal areas in the north regions and south of Santa Catarina state are also expected to be affected, according to Inmet.", "source":

I am confident that the determined and resilient spirit of the Brazilian people will triumph over this unfortunate tragedy. Please accept, excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration,\" President Ali added.\n\nThere have been a series of floods in the Rio Grande do Sul state, leaving 276 persons injured, 111 missing and 121,000 displaced. These statistics were provided by the Civil Defense agency in the state on Monday.\n\nAdditionally, over 850,000 persons in 345 municipalities were affected by the disaster, which also destroyed homes and infrastructure such as roads and bridges. As a matter of fact, over 60 roads have either been totally or partially blocked because of the flooding.\n\nIn addition, the Gua\u00edba River water level rose again on Sunday morning to 5.33 centimeters, making it the highest water level in history. Waters from this river have flooded the historic center of the regional capital of Porto Alegre, a city of 1.3 million inhabitants.\n\nThen there is also the city's international airport, which was closed on Friday night as the flood had reached its runways. According to reports from out of Rio Grande do Sul, the airport remains closed.\n\nThe Brazilian President had also visited Rio Grande do Sul on Sunday to survey the affected areas and oversee the emergency response efforts.

It has already rained 200 mm [8 inches] in some areas and projections indicate much more water coming. 2023 scenes of flooded cities will be repeated.\"\n\nTwo days later, they began to post about overflowing creeks, rising river levels, and flooding while The National Institute of Meteorology (Inmet) put the entire state under alert, showing a varying scale from yellow to red, the latter being the larger portion. On April 30, the local government confirmed eight dead and 21 people disappeared.\n\nEver since the publication of this story on May 7, the worst natural disaster in the history of Rio Grande do Sul has registered 100 dead, 128 disappeared, and over 1.4 million people affected. Sums that seem still underreported when one sees the images of entire cities underwater.\n\nAmong the 497 cities in the state, 414 were hit so far. And, as you read it, there is a chance people are still waiting on roofs for rescue, trapped in houses and buildings surrounded by water. Others are still looking for victims of landslides; and many are without access to clean water, power, or ways of coming and going from their cities, with bridges missing and roads destroyed. The rain is moving south and is forecasted to return to other cities already impacted.\n\nIn September 2023, after the worst climate disaster Rio Grande do Sul had registered at the time, re-elected governor Eduardo Leite (PSDB, Social Democracy Party) said in an interview for Globo News TV channel that \"math models couldn't foresee the volume of rains.\" This time, there isn't any surprise.\n\nAn expert quoted by Deutsch Welle says the state became a target now because of an overlay of weather phenomenons, like recent heat waves and the influence of El Ni\u00f1o. Although Marcelo Seluchi, coordinator of Cemaden (National Center of Monitoring and Alert for Natural Disasters), says no place in the world would be able to resist this situation, \"there could have been contingency and prevention plans.\" \"You can't do it from one week to the other. This is something missing,\" he said.\n\nThe first cities hit by the local catastrophe that swallowed Rio Grande do Sul registered landslides, bridges destroyed and floods that covered cities and highways, making help even more difficult to arrive.\n\nIn the state capital, Porto Alegre, the Gua\u00edba River surpassed an 83-year historic markwhen it reached 4.77 meters of elevation. It has reached 5.3 meters now -- its system limit to cause a flood is 3 meters. Neighborhoods that had never registered floods had to be evacuated, but many residents remained isolated in their homes. Over 85 percent of the population had no access to clean water, even in supermarkets, and the airport is still under water, with flights estimated to be suspended till the end of the month. Nonada, a Global Voices' partner, had to cease publishing for a few days.\n\nWhile the world, the rest of Brazil and 1.6 million people on the ground watched Madonna's free concert in Rio de Janeiro, on May 4, on social media, people shared addresses with calls for rescue and help in the metropolitan area of Porto Alegre, videos of volunteers working and alarming rumors about corpses and violence.\n\nWith the high demand for assistance, besides police and the armed forces, many volunteers joined the front amidst the emergency.\n\nGr\u00eamio and Internacional, the two traditional football teams and rivals from Porto Alegre, had their stadiums invaded by waters. While both clubs are trying to stop the national competitions they're playing, footballers from both teams have been helping with rescues and volunteering in donation centres and shelters.\n\nInfluencers outside of Rio Grande do Sul also joined massive donation campaigns and actions. A Brazilian surfer, Pedro Scooby, gathered friends and travelled by road with jet skies to support the ongoing rescues, digital influencer Felipe Neto managed to rent and arrange trucks to carry drinkable water from a water park to the cities affected, humorist Whinderson Nunes rented aircraft and organized food donations.\n\nStill, reports of financial scams using the floods, politicians and influencers spreading fake news and attempts of robbery and attacks on houses are increasing.\n\nJournalist Isabela Reis crossed news and posts in a thread trying to understand the timeline until the explosion of the climate disaster, calling out the state government for \"neglect and inoperability.\" Many on social media complain of people \"trying to politicize the tragedy,\" while others emphasize politics has everything to do with it.\n\nTo BBC Brazil, executive-secretary to the Climate Watch (Observat\u00f3rio do Clima), Marcio Astrini, said \"The tragedy is also a responsibility of senators and members of the congress who disassemble the environmental legislation,\" and stated:\n\n\"Every year the government of Rio Grande do Sul gets extremely flabbergasted that rains are intense. The government of Rio de Janeiro gets surprised when it happens in Petr\u00f3polis. It's a surprise in S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Paulo, in northern Minas Gerais, in Recife (Pernambuco), in the south of Bahia. It happens that it has been nine consecutive years with temperature averages as the hottest ones ever recorded. There is no surprise anymore. We need to brace ourselves for that.\"\n\nEduardo Leite, the state governor, defended himself from critics, saying \"this is not the time to look for culprits.\" People questioned the state's preparation to mitigate the consequences of the current rains and floods or the aftermath to help out victims. During his two terms, Leite altered points in the environmental legislation, made rules to install dams in environmental preservation areas more flexible, and reduced the 2024 budget destined for the Civil Defense, compared to 2023.\n\nLuiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva's government (PT, Workers' Party) installed a crisis cabinet in the state and recognized calamity status for several cities, which could make a budget increase more accessible and unlimited.\n\nEnvironment Minister Marina Silva was among the ministers who traveled with Lula to Rio Grande do Sul. In an interview with CNN Brazil, she talked about the idea of a climate emergency decree for 1,942 cities in Brazil that are susceptible to extreme climate occurrences. Marina explained:\n\n\"When decreeing a climate emergency, you can have continuous actions, sometimes of removing the population, draining, building support, a proper infrastructure, alert systems that can be fast, combining technology with relation and community integration.\"", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurasia Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

caught up in the state's Rio Grande do Sul \"worst disaster.\"\n\nShocking drone footage shows the stadium submerged underwater after the devastating deluge that swamped Brazil last week.\n\nThe stadium in Porto Alegre, home to Sport Club Internacional, will not host any matches until at least May 27.\n\nThe 50,000-capacity stadium hosted five matches during the 2014 World Cup.\n\nIt's the latest stadium to close due to severe flooding after the state's Gremio Arena and Est\u00e1dio Alfredo Jaconi were also inundated.\n\nIn the video, hundreds of houses can be seen submerged, with only their roofs visible as locals were using small boards and surfboards to move around.\n\nThe flood-ravaged country is still reeling from the catastrophe, as emergency services continued to try and

current.\n\nOn Tuesday, state governor Eduardo Leite had warned the human toll was likely to rise as \"the emergency is continuing to develop\" in the state capital of Porto Alegre and other cities and towns.\n\nThe state's governor Eduardo Leite, speaking at a news conference earlier this week urged residents to seek shelter as the anticipated downpour may cause more severe flooding.\n\n\"Contaminated water can transmit diseases,\" civil defense spokeswoman Sabrina Ribas warned on Wednesday.\n\nEst\u00e1dio Beira-Rio was one of the 12 venues used for the 2014 FIFA World

recover.\n\nAuthorities estimate it will cost up to \u00a3745 million to clean up the damage.\n\nThe state's Guaiba River, which runs through Porto Alegre, reached historic levels and five dams are at

This is the same state that endured three climate disasters in 2023 alone, with 80 people confirmed dead and many cities hit.\n\nThe following day, the agency posted another alert: \"Serious risk of floods in southern Brazil because of excessive to extreme rain. It has already rained 200 mm [8 inches] in some areas and projections indicate much more water coming. 2023 scenes of flooded cities will be repeated.\"\n\nTwo days later, they began to post about overflowing creeks, rising river levels, and flooding while The National Institute of Meteorology (Inmet) put the entire state under alert, showing a varying scale from yellow to red, the latter being the larger portion. On April 30, the local government confirmed eight dead and 21 people disappeared.\n\nEver since the publication of this story on May 7, the worst natural disaster in the history of Rio Grande do Sul has registered 100 dead, 128 disappeared, and over 1.4 million people affected. Sums that seem still underreported when one sees the images of entire cities underwater.\n\nAmong the 497 cities in the state, 414 were hit so far. And, as you read it, there is a chance people are still waiting on roofs for rescue, trapped in houses and buildings surrounded by water. Others are still looking for victims of landslides; and many are without access to clean water, power, or ways of coming and going from their cities, with bridges missing and roads destroyed. The rain is moving south and is forecasted to return to other cities already impacted.\n\nIn September 2023, after the worst climate disaster Rio Grande do Sul had registered at the time, re-elected governor Eduardo Leite (PSDB, Social Democracy Party) said in an interview for Globo News TV channel that \"math models couldn't foresee the volume of rains.\" This time, there isn't any surprise.\n\nAn expert quoted by Deutsch Welle says the state became a target now because of an overlay of weather phenomenons, like recent heat waves and the influence of El Ni\u00f1o. Although Marcelo Seluchi, coordinator of Cemaden (National Center of Monitoring and Alert for Natural Disasters), says no place in the world would be able to resist this situation, \"there could have been contingency and prevention plans.\" \"You can't do it from one week to the other. This is something missing,\" he said.\n\nThe first cities hit by the local catastrophe that swallowed Rio Grande do Sul registered landslides, bridges destroyed and floods that covered cities and highways, making help even more difficult to arrive.\n\nThis place is at the line between cities of Bento Gon\u00e7alves and Veran\u00f3polis, in the Arches' bridge, a rural area. People used to go there to enjoy pubs and restaurantes around, with local cuisine. We had houses and restaurants, an important road. There is nothing anymore.\n\nNOW | An historical front page and one of the most impactful ones in the 100 years of Correio do Povo newspaper, in a special edition this Friday, with the image of Taquari Valley submerged and lightning in the background with the storm.\n\nIn the state capital, Porto Alegre, the Gua\u00edba River surpassed an 83-year historic mark when it reached 4.77 meters of elevation. It has reached 5.3 meters now -- its system limit to cause a flood is 3 meters. Neighborhoods that had never registered floods had to be evacuated, but many residents remained isolated in their homes. Over 85 percent of the population had no access to clean water, even in supermarkets, and the airport is still under water, with flights estimated to be suspended till the end of the month. Nonada, a Global Voices' partner, had to cease publishing for a few days.\n\nWhile the world, the rest of Brazil and 1.6 million people on the ground watched Madonna's free concert in Rio de Janeiro, on April 4, on social media, people shared addresses with calls for rescue and help in the metropolitan area of Porto Alegre, videos of volunteers working and alarming rumors about corpses and violence.\n\nA touching image from Canoas, where people do a human chain to help the watercrafts used to rescue people isolated.\n\nWith the high demand for assistance, besides police and the armed forces, many volunteers joined the front amidst the emergency.\n\nGr\u00eamio and Internacional, the two traditional football teams and rivals from Porto Alegre, had their stadiums invaded by waters. While both clubs are trying to stop the championships they play, footballers from both teams have been helping with rescues and volunteering in donation centres and shelters.\n\nCa\u00edque is helping to rescue people by boat.\n\nRochet is helping since day one to make and to distribute packed lunches.\n\nDiego Costa arranged jet-skis, sheltered people in his home and is using his jeep.\n\nThiago Maia is also helping.\n\nInfluencers outside of Rio Grande do Sul also joined massive donation campaigns and actions. A Brazilian surfer, Pedro Scooby, gathered friends and travelled by road with jet skies to support the ongoing rescues, digital influencer Felipe Neto managed to rent and arrange trucks to carry drinkable water from a water park to the cities affected, humorist Whinderson Nunes rented aircraft and organized food donations.\n\nStill, reports of financial scams using the floods, politicians and influencers spreading fake news and attempts of robbery and attacks on houses are increasing.\n\nJournalist Isabela Reis crossed news and posts in a thread trying to understand the timeline until the explosion of the climate disaster, calling out the state government for \"neglect and inoperability.\" Many on social media complain of people \"trying to politicize the tragedy,\" while others emphasize politics has everything to do with it.\n\nTo BBC Brazil, executive-secretary to the Climate Watch (Observat\u00f3rio do Clima), Marcio Astrini, said \"The tragedy is also a responsibility of senators and members of the congress who disassemble the environmental legislation,\" and stated:\n\nTodo ano o governo do Rio Grande do Sul fica extremamente espantado que as chuvas s\u00e3o intensas. O governo do Rio de Janeiro fica super surpreso quando acontece em Petr\u00f3polis. \u00c9 uma surpresa em S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o (SP), no norte de Minas Gerais, em Recife (PE), no sul da Bahia. S\u00f3 que acontece que j\u00e1 faz nove anos consecutivos que as m\u00e9dias de temperatura do planeta s\u00e3o as mais quentes j\u00e1 registradas. N\u00e3o tem mais surpresa. A gente precisa se preparar para isso.\n\nEvery year the government of Rio Grande do Sul gets extremely flabbergasted that rains are intense. The government of Rio de Janeiro gets surprised when it happens in Petr\u00f3polis. It's a surprise in S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Paulo, in northern Minas Gerais, in Recife (Pernambuco), in the south of Bahia. It happens that it has been nine consecutive years with temperature averages as the hottest ones ever recorded. There is no surprise anymore. We need to brace ourselves for that.\n\nEduardo Leite, the center-right state governor, defended himself from critics, saying \"this is not the time to look for culprits.\" People questioned the state's preparation to mitigate the consequences of the current rains and floods or the aftermath to help out victims. During his two terms, Leite altered points in the environmental legislation, made rules to install dams in environmental preservation areas more flexible, and reduced the budget destined for the Civil Defense from 2023 to 2024.\n\nLuiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva's government (PT, Workers' Party) installed a crisis cabinet in the state and recognized calamity status for several cities, which could make a budget increase more accessible and unlimited.\n\nEnvironment Minister Marina Silva was among the ministers who traveled with Lula to Rio Grande do Sul. In an interview with CNN Brazil, she talked about the idea of a climate emergency decree for 1,942 cities in Brazil that are susceptible to extreme climate occurrences. Marina explained:\n\nAo decretar emerg\u00eancia clim\u00e1tica, voc\u00ea pode ter a\u00e7\u00f5es que sejam continuadas, \u00e0s vezes de remo\u00e7\u00e3o de popula\u00e7\u00e3o, de drenagem, de

With factories stalled and logistics crippled, the sector's resilience is tested amid a broader national crisis.\n\nIn the wake of devastating floods in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, the automotive sector faces unprecedented challenges. This disaster has caused widespread destruction and significantly disrupted the local economy, particularly affecting the automotive industry, a vital driver of the region's economic engine.\n\nThe Association of Automobile Manufacturers of Brazil (Anfavea) expressed concerns this Wednesday about the potential impacts of the ongoing floods on the production chain. During a press conference, M\u00e1rcio Leite, the association's president, highlighted that ten manufacturers and a vast network of suppliers in the southern region are experiencing severe disruptions. \"The impact is substantial across the entire chain,\" Leite noted.\n\nClaudio Shad, president of the Union of Automotive Component Industries, provided more granular details. A survey among component factories in Rio Grande do Sul revealed significant stoppages, particularly around Porto Alegre, where facilities are wholly paralyzed due to floodwaters. While some areas of the state are less affected, allowing production to limp on, logistical nightmares abound due to road closures that block the transportation of essential components to assembly plants.\n\nIn Gravata\u00ed, the situation is slightly better, with factories only mildly affected and alternative transportation routes being utilized. However, factories in the Caxias area find themselves isolated and cut off from supply lines and distribution networks.\n\nDespite these challenges, Shad remains optimistic that the industry can maintain operations without a shortage of components. He believes that the current difficulties are temporary and will be swiftly overcome. \"We are working to minimize the impact of this tragedy as much as possible,\" he asserted, though he admitted that the severe conditions might affect next month's production figures.\n\nThe broader picture in Rio Grande do Sul is grim. According to the latest report from Civil Defense, the torrential rains and resulting floods have left at least 95 people dead and 128 missing. Neighboring state Santa Catarina also reported casualties. The disaster has affected 1.5 million people, with approximately 400 injured and 80% of municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul impacted by the floods.\n\nThe floods have laid bare the vulnerabilities in the region's infrastructure and emergency preparedness. The automotive sector, pivotal to Brazil's economy, especially in Rio Grande do Sul, underscores a larger narrative of how climate change and environmental disasters increasingly impact industrial operations and economic stability in Latin America.\n\nThe region's dependence on localized industries, such as automotive manufacturing, makes it particularly susceptible to such disruptions. Policymakers and business leaders have been aware of the potential risks for years. Still, the recent events have injected a new urgency into the discourse on sustainable industrial practices and disaster readiness.\n\nBrazil's current crisis could serve as a wake-up call in Latin America, where many countries are prone to natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes. It highlights the need for comprehensive strategies integrating environmental considerations with industrial planning to ensure resilience against future catastrophes.\n\nMoreover, the economic implications of these disruptions are far-reaching. The automotive industry in Brazil is not only a significant employer but also a major contributor to GDP. The current interruptions could have ripple effects across the national economy, affecting everything from export volumes to local job markets.\n\nAs the region begins to recover and rebuild, the lessons learned from this crisis will likely influence future approaches to industrial development and disaster management in Latin America.

The South American nation saw unusually heavy rainfall last week which resulted in the flooding of the southern state. As help starts pouring in from every corner of the planet, Max Verstappen has made a generous contribution as well.\n\nAs per GE.GLOBO, Verstappen gave away a signed Red Bull Racing T-shirt for an auction to Bazaar for Good. The proceeds from the auction will go for flood relief in Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nBazaar for Good is a collective of 30 women with a strong social media presence from different countries. The collective raises funds to support underprivileged children in different countries. Verstappen's partner Kelly Piquet is one of the 30 members of the host committee.\n\nKelly, daughter of three-time F1 world champion Nelson Piquet, hails from Brazil herself. An advocate for children's rights, she has often raised her voice against the Israel-Palestine conflict, citing atrocities faced by the young. Piquet once again made an appeal recently, this time calling for help for the flood victims in Brazil.\n\nThrough an Instagram post in Portuguese, she wrote, \"At this moment, all help is important! Many families are homeless and in need of rescue due to heavy rains in Rio Grande do Sul. There are a lot of people making a difference and you can too.\"\n\nAnother F1 personality to join the rescue efforts for floods in Brazil is model Francisca 'Kika' Cerqueira Gomes. Kika, who is dating Alpine F1 team's driver Pierre Gasly, shared a video released by renowned supermodel and Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bundchen. Gisele made an appeal for donations towards the relief operations carried out in the affected area.\n\nBundchen said, \"My home state in Rio Grande do Sul, south in Brazil, has had its worst tragedy in its history. Heavy rains flooded entire towns in most parts of the state. It's not just one city, it's more than 350 cities affected. People are not only losing their houses, their jobs, they're losing everything and there are many still to be rescued.\"\n\nThe Brazilian model shared devastating visuals from ground zero while making an emotional appeal. She also shared snippets of rescue operations but urged her followers to contribute more to help the locals affected.\n\nBrazil is one of the most iconic places where Formula 1 races year after year. The country also has a special connection to the sport through Lewis Hamilton, who got honorary citizenship just two years ago.\n\nWhile the seven-time world champion is expected to make an appeal soon, many other F1 drivers can join him too.

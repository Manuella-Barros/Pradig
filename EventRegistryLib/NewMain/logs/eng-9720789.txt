It said Wednesday, July 10, 2024 [...]\n\nBEIJING (AP) -- China announced an investigation Wednesday into whether the European Union has adopted unfair trade practices in its probes of Chinese companies bidding on projects in the 27-nation bloc. The move is the latest in a brewing trade war between the two economic giants.\n\nThe investigation will focus on wind power, photovoltaics, security equipment and electric trains, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said.\n\nThe EU has used a new regulation to investigate companies bidding for projects within the European Union. These include a probe into whether Chinese subsidies give wind turbine companies an unfair advantage in the competition for projects in Spain, Greece, France, Romania and Bulgaria.\n\nChina accused the European Union of protectionism and \"reckless distortion\" of the definition of subsidies in response to that investigation. The EU has also investigated Chinese companies bidding for a 455-megawatt solar park in Romania and for the procurement of 20 electric trains in Bulgaria.\n\nThe Chinese investigation will be completed before Jan. 10, with a possible extension of three months to April.

It concluded that Chinese state subsidies for its EV industry were unfairly undermining European rivals.\n\nLast week, the EU slapped extra provisional duties of up to 38 percent on Chinese EV imports, prompting an outcry from manufacturers, Chinese business groups, and the Chinese government.\n\nBeijing rejects the probe's findings and has said it will take \"necessary measures\" to safeguard the rights of its companies.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Industrial policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar panel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Locomotive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photovoltaics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Import and Export", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111629934,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-555917,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720789", "eventUri": "eng-9720789", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-01-", "textStart": 1249, "textEnd": 1259}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

"body": "Beijing said yesterday it is kicking off a formal probe into EU practices after the bloc launched an anti-subsidy investigation of a range of Chinese transport and green energy firms.\n\nThe Chinese Ministry of Commerce said it would \"conduct a trade and investment barrier investigation into the relevant practices adopted by the EU in its investigation of Chinese enterprises.\"\n\nThe probe followed a complaint made by the national chamber of commerce for importing and exporting machinery and electronics, the ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe complaint mainly dealt with \"products such as railway locomotives, photovoltaics, wind power and security inspection equipment,\" it said.\n\nThe ministry added that the probe would examine the EU's \"preliminary reviews, in-depth investigations and surprise inspections of Chinese enterprises.\"\n\nIt said the investigation would likely last until January 10 next year, but may be extended by a further three months under \"special circumstances\".\n\nThe EU has previously launched similar probes into Beijing's support for domestically produced trains, solar panels and electric cars.\n\nThey have come as the 27-nation bloc seeks to scale up renewable energy use to meet its target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n\nBut it also wants to step away from what it sees as excessive reliance on Chinese technology at a time when many Western governments increasingly see Beijing as a national security threat.\n\nBrussels opened its first probe under the Foreign Subsidies Regulation in February, targeting a subsidiary of Chinese rail giant CRRC Corp (\u4e2d\u570b\u4e2d\u8eca).\n\nThat investigation was closed after the subsidiary withdrew from a tender in Bulgaria to supply electric trains.\n\nA second probe targets Chinese-owned solar panel manufacturers seeking to build and operate a photovoltaic park in Romania, partly financed by European funds.\n\nUnder a different set of rules, Brussels in September last year started a probe into subsidies for Chinese electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nIt concluded that Chinese state subsidies for its EV industry were unfairly undermining European rivals.\n\nLast week, the EU slapped extra provisional duties of up to 38 percent on Chinese EV imports, prompting an outcry from manufacturers, Chinese business groups and the Chinese government.\n\nBeijing rejects the probe's findings and has said it will take \"necessary measures\" to safeguard the rights of its companies.", "source": {"uri": "taipeitimes.com", "dataType":

Those are areas the EU has targeted in recent months with an array of new tools, which it says are designed to defend itself against Beijing's unfair practices.\n\nIf Beijing determines an EU measure to be illegal, Chinese officials could conduct bilateral talks, start a multilateral dispute settlement and take \"other appropriate measures,\" according to the rules of the probe. In a separate document, the ministry said steps could include a recommendation to introduce \"retaliatory measures.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the European Commission didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nBeijing's relationship with the EU has hit fresh lows in recent months, as the bloc brings its China policy closer to that of the US. American and European leaders have slammed Beijing for flooding their markets with a surge in cheap exports, and raised the alarm about strengthening economic security as tensions flare.\n\nAt the center of those strains with the EU are China's electric car exports, which Europe is worried threaten jobs in its own autos sector. The bloc last week set provisional tariffs as high as 37.6 percent against some car exports from China, after US President Joe Biden announced a new 100 percent tariff on such Chinese products.\n\nOn top of that, the EU has launched a probe into China's procurement of medical devices under a new tool to ensure reciprocity, and used fresh anti-subsidy rules to raid a Chinese security equipment firm it claimed had used subsidies to distort the market.\n\nChina, which says the EU's actions violate the principle of free trade, has responded with investigations into French brandy and Spanish pork, as well as telegraphing threats against other industries such as large-engine cars that Germany specializes in and aviation, a sector where France looms large.\n\nBeijing's wide-reaching investigation should be completed by Jan. 10, with a possible extension till mid-April, according to the Ministry of Commerce statement. The probe was launched on the back of a request from the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products, it added.\n\nThe results will come shortly after the November deadline for the EU to decide whether to impose lasting tariffs on electric cars from China.\n\nBehind closed doors talks are underway on the EV tariffs, with the EU welcoming China to respond to the findings of its probe. Despite that, the EU ambassador to China said Beijing only recently responded to the bloc's requests for talks -- a claim commerce officials dismissed as \"definitely inconsistent with facts.\"\n\nChina opened a similar investigation into Taiwan's ban on some Chinese imports last year. After the Commerce Ministry ruled such an action constituted a trade barrier, Beijing ended concessions on some Taiwanese chemical imports, and said it was studying the suspension of more allowances on other products from the island.

This came after the European bloc imposed high tariffs on environmentally friendly products made in China.\n\nChina's Ministry of Commerce said it would investigate trade and investment barriers allegedly put in place by the EU. The probe follows complaints from domestic chambers of commerce that import and export machinery and electronics.\n\n\"The complaints mainly concern products such as railway locomotives, photovoltaic energy, wind energy and security control equipment,\" the agency said, quoted by AFP.\n\n\"The investigation will review the EU's initial review, in-depth investigations and unannounced inspections of Chinese companies,\" he added.\n\nTrade tensions between Beijing and Brussels have escalated in recent months, with the EU targeting Chinese government support in the form of subsidies for the renewable energy sector, particularly electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nThe drumbeat of the trade war in the electric vehicle trade itself came after three Chinese manufacturers, BYD, SAIC and Geely, refused to cooperate with a European trade investigation. Brussels accuses all three of being state-subsidized, making the blue continent's manufacturers less competitive in their own region.\n\nThis eventually led the EU to impose temporary additional duties of up to 38% on imports of electric vehicles from China. Beijing rejected the findings of the investigation and said it would take necessary measures to protect the rights of its companies.\n\nEurope's largest carmaker, Volkswagen, has also opened new talking points by quickly criticizing the move. They say it could trigger a backlash from China, which is one of the manufacturer's largest markets.\n\n\"The negative impact of this decision outweighs the benefits for the European and especially German automotive industry,\" a Volkswagen spokesman said in a statement.\n\nIn addition to electric vehicles, Brussels has also opened a similar investigation targeting a subsidiary of Chinese railway giant CRRC. The investigation was closed after the subsidiary withdrew from a tender in Bulgaria for the supply of electric trains.\n\nAnother investigation also targeted a Chinese solar panel manufacturer that wanted to build and operate a photovoltaic park in Romania.

Earlier this year, the EU launched investigations into China's state support for its wind turbine and solar panel suppliers. It has also recently completed an eight-month-long probe into Beijing's support for makers of electric vehicles, resulting in additional tariffs on EVs imported from China.\n\nNow, China will investigate if the bloc's probes violate the two sides' economic treaty and if they have hurt the country's trade with the 27 EU member states.\n\nThe investigation by China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) will span a number of sectors, including rail, photovoltaics, wind power, and security inspection equipment, according to a statement posted on its website.\n\nIf MOFCOM deems that the EU's probes amount to \"trade barriers,\" it can start negotiations with the EU, launch a multilateral dispute resolution process, or take other \"appropriate measures\" to address the issue, according to rules published by the ministry in 2005.\n\nThe announcement comes just days after the provisional additional duties on imports of Chinese-made EVs into the EU came into effect. Talks between the two sides are expected to continue -- if no agreement is reached, the tariffs will become definitive in November.\n\nBeijing has spoken out strongly against the EU tariffs, saying it will make \"all necessary moves\" to safeguard China's interests. Last month, it opened a probe into pork imported from the bloc and it is also investigating European brandy imports.\n\nAccording to Wednesday's announcement, MOFCOM is launching its latest investigation in response to a June request by an industry group in China.

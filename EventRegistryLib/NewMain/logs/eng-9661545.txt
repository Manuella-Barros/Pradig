Midtown Direct trains are diverted to HOB.\"\n\nEarlier, NJ Transit service to and from New York Penn Station was suspended due to Amtrak's overhead wire issues, coinciding with the start of a predicted extended heat wave.\n\nInitially, NJ Transit reported 60-minute delays on its rail lines in and out of Penn Station shortly after 7 a.m., diverting MidTown Direct trains to Hoboken Terminal. By 7:47 a.m., this was upgraded to a complete service suspension, according to NJ Transit's social media updates. PATH trains are now cross-honoring NJ Transit rail tickets at Newark Penn Station, Hoboken, and 33rd Street in New York. NJ Transit officials confirmed that an Amtrak commuter train is blocking tracks at Penn Station.\n\nAdditionally, NJ Transit and private carrier buses are honoring rail tickets Tuesday morning. The wire problem coincides with an anticipated stretch of 90-degree-plus heat in the Northeast.\n\nExcessive heat can cause the overhead catenary wires, which supply electric power to trains, to sag. The Northeast Corridor, owned by Amtrak, has catenary and signal wires between New York and New Brunswick that date back to the 1930s and 1940s. Some of these wires have been repeatedly spliced to repair issues that require permanent replacement, said NJ Transit CEO Kevin Corbett in an interview last week.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

NJ Transit, Amtrak repair aging system", "body": "The Gateway Project's $18.4 billion first phase will make rail service more reliable NJ Transit and Amtrak riders between New Jersey and Manhattan.\n\nMichelle D. was one of the thousands of NJ Transit commuters who had an hours-long, hellish journey home recently after wires fell on the tracks a few miles from New York Penn Station, halting trains along the nation's busiest stretch of rail at the worst possible time -- 5:05 p.m.\n\nThe Chatham resident, who commutes daily on the Morris & Essex line to her Manhattan job, waited an hour at New York Penn Station on May 22 before finding out all trains were canceled. She and hordes of others made their way to the nearest PATH station, where every train car was 10 to 20 people deep. So she had to wait for the next train.\n\nAmid pushing and shoving, she eventually boarded another packed train out of Hoboken -- after almost getting smacked in the face by another rider's backpack -- only to have it stop at the next station because of a medical emergency.\n\nHer 10-mile journey home ultimately took four hours.\n\nOver the course of just three days, NJ Transit and Amtrak commuters endured a litany of hours-long, haphazard commutes because of equipment failures along three bridges or tunnels whose average age is 105 and overhead wires, or catenary, that predates the 1950s. Journeying on aging, deteriorated and long-neglected infrastructure to get to and from New York Penn Station has -- yet again -- become a predictably unpredictable odyssey. And the end isn't near.\n\nMichelle's commute the morning before took three hours as trains were delayed and canceled because NJ Transit's pantograph, the equipment atop the train that distributes power, became ensnared with the overhead wire.\n\nThat week's commuting problems didn't end there.\n\nMay 23, the day after the downed wires, was little better as customers dealt with residual delays and cancellations because train equipment was not where it needed to be. Crews were also short because they worked too many hours the day before and couldn't work the next day. Before noon, there were new wire versus pantograph issues and signal problems cropped up at the 89-year-old Dock Bridge outside Newark Penn Station, causing new layers of delays and travel chaos.\n\nAnd the night cap? During the evening rush hour, the 114-year-old Portal Bridge, which carries trains over the Hackensack River, had to open for marine traffic, causing more delays.\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu from 'Summer of Hell' circa 2017?\n\nNJ Transit and Amtrak customers are trapped in this commuting purgatory for at least another 10 years as the decades-old assets on the notorious 10-mile stretch of rail between Newark Penn Station and New York Penn Station slowly get replaced, repaired and reinforced.\n\nAs the northeast endures an extreme heat wave this week, wire versus pantograph issues have already cropped up, forcing New York Penn Station to close during the morning rush Tuesday. Delays and commuting headaches were felt up and down the corridor all day, with an Amtrak train breaking down in Penn during the evening rush hour.\n\nMichelle, a veteran commuter who has endured the far-reaching effects of the erratic Northeast Corridor for a decade, said the recent problems are reminiscent of 2017, when delays and cancellations snowballed in the first few months of the year. (She didn't provide her last name because of her employer's corporate media policy.)\n\nStory continues below video\n\nBy the end of April that year, there were two minor derailments in New York Penn Station and Amtrak officials decided to accelerate more than three years of planned work into eight weeks, a period known as the \"Summer of Hell\" because it required cancellations and train diversions to other stations.\n\nThe problems unfolding today are not a direct comparison to 2017. Today's issues are largely related to signals, wires and NJ Transit's pantographs, while the major problems that led to the emergency work in 2017 were derailments due to track problems in New York Penn Station.\n\nIn the first four months of 2017, NJ Transit canceled 708 trains because of Amtrak-related issues, according to the agency -- NJ Transit shares the use of Amtrak-owned rail routes on the busiest stretch of track in the state between Philadelphia and New York. In the first four months of this year, NJ Transit says 329 of its trains were canceled because of Amtrak.\n\nThe May 22 incident alone impacted 155 NJ Transit and 29 Amtrak trains over two days.\n\nMichelle remembers 2017 being a long, painful summer as the repairs were completed, but said she would endure another weeks-long period of repairs -- if it meant getting improved service faster.\n\n\"I would definitely prefer a defined repair period where customers know what to expect rather than the free-for-all we're in,\" she said. \"Tell us, 'These 6 weeks, we're fixing X, Y, and Z,' but then actually come through and fix things that improve service. Stick to the deadline. Keep the delays in the realm of reasonable. Let us plan accordingly.\"\n\nPreventing an Amtrak versus NJ Transit war\n\nAmtrak and NJ Transit officials met earlier this month to discuss short- and long-term plans to prevent another May 22 problem from happening, but both agencies said a \"Summer of Hell\"-style work plan doesn't make sense right now.\n\nKevin Corbett, president and CEO of NJ Transit, said they're trying to take a \"surgical approach versus a generic approach,\" but admitted the agency is open to that as a last resort.\n\n\"I don't think we're looking at a wholesale thing at this point,\" Corbett said. \"But we need to look at weekends, canceling some trains, early trains or late trains\" to give Amtrak a wider window \"if they show the benefit of doing that and how much they can accelerate.\"\n\nGery Williams, Amtrak's executive vice president of service delivery and operations, said, \"We've got a strong partnership, the teams have worked together after these incidents\" since May 22 figuring out what has to be done \"to prevent any further reoccurrences.\"\n\nThe four-decade-old landlord-tenant relationship between Amtrak and NJ Transit can be tense. Meetings like the one earlier this month were frank, but productive, according to Corbett. Both sides tried to communicate to the other their biggest challenges and problems on the Northeast Corridor, including the May 22 incident -- the cause of which Amtrak says it could not determine -- and what solutions can be accommodated by both agencies.\n\nThey aim to avoid a repeat of 2017.\n\nThe relationship between Amtrak and NJ Transit soured when then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie began withholding NJ Transit's payments to Amtrak and sought to recoup past payments. NJ Transit currently pays about $226 million in annual operating and capital costs to Amtrak for use of its tracks in New Jersey, plus stations and yards in Pennsylvania and New York that are also owned by Amtrak.\n\nAfter weeks of negotiation, the Summer of Hell work plan was agreed to and Christie also insisted on better communication between Amtrak and NJ Transit. This included daily updates about the repair work and included NJ Transit in the new operations center where real-time service changes could be communicated to customers.\n\nChristie also gave NJ Transit-impacted customers a break on fares during the work period by halving them, an estimated cost of $15 million to the state; today, NJ Transit customers are bracing for a 15% fare increase July 1.\n\nChristie infamously canceled plans to build a new rail tunnel into Penn Station in 2010, a project that would have been completed by now and could have addressed some wire and signal problems worsening today.\n\nCorbett often reminds people that New Jersey and Amtrak have ended the bitter war of the last administration.\n\nBut problems like the ones encountered May 22 dredge up the same bitter feelings from 2017, and Gov. Phil Murphy sent a sternly worded letter to Amtrak's board Chair Anthony Coscia the day after the overhead wire problems to put those feelings on the public record.\n\n\"I refuse to accept these Amtrak infrastructure challenges as an inevitable part of operating integrated mass transit systems,\" Murphy wrote. \"Amtrak needs to make immediate short-term and long-term investments to address infrastructure vulnerabilities and updated emergency management plans to provide more robust alternative modes of transportation when equipment failure occurs.\"\n\nAmtrak has increased investments on repairs on the Northeast Corridor between Trenton and New York Penn Station. This year, Amtrak will spend 71% more on railroad track, catenary, bridges, signals, and other infrastructure on that stretch of track when compared to 2021.\n\nStephen Gardner, Amtrak's CEO, responded to Murphy's letter apologizing for the incidents that unfolded the week of May 20, though he noted they believe two of the five were Amtrak's fault, while three were attributed to NJ Transit's pantographs.\n\nWhile the teams from both agencies are reviewing plans to accelerate catenary and signal system upgrades, Gardner said Amtrak needs firmer financial commitments from New Jersey to capitalize on hundreds of millions in federal grants for larger-scale projects to replace, modernize or support the aging infrastructure, including the Sawtooth and Dock bridges, a new Kearny substation and catenary upgrades.\n\nDrilling down to root causes\n\nAmong the ideas that came out of the meeting between Amtrak and NJ Transit is a new working group. It will be headed by Amtrak's Williams and Jim Sincaglia, NJ Transit's senior vice president of rail, but Corbett said the most important thing is it will bring together the people underneath them, the ones who are \"going to make a difference\" to prevent and respond to the incidents that affect commuters.\n\nThis is in addition to weekly updates Amtrak provides NJ Transit on progress regarding routine upgrades and repairs, the result of another fiasco last July when three Amtrak wire incidents led to days of outages and more than 400 trains cancelled or delayed.\n\n\"We're going to be outlining, with NJT, how to increase the level of maintenance, but also more importantly the programmatic work or basically the production work where we would actually replace wire and things like that,\" Williams said. \"Unfortunately, to really get the ability and the productivity to do that, you've got to have time on the railroad at night.\"\n\nThis new group will help ensure more repair work can get done on the Northeast Corridor by bringing together the people who can work out four essential things: the most urgent problems in need of fixing; overnights or weekends when some trains may get canceled so more work can get done; ensuring there are enough people to complete the work; and identifying root causes of problems \"and solve it without trying to nail anybody, but just to make sure it doesn't happen again,\" Corbett said.\n\nCorbett hopes this group will be able to take project ideas to replace catenary or bury signal wires, which were expected to take place in at least five years, and accelerate them -- or prioritize them over other projects -- so they can reap benefits in the near-term.\n\n\"Dock Bridge is not a major cause of delays,\" Corbett said as an example. \"It's much more important that they accelerate the catenary and signal projects than prioritizing a project like Dock Bridge -- so that's the kind of issues we're working through.\"\n\nHaving the manpower to take full advantage of planned outages has been a challenge for Amtrak. Though they've made strides in hiring, extensive training must take place before certain skilled workers can be on a high-voltage railroad job site, so those who are qualified end up on large-scale projects rather than routine outages for repairs.\n\nNJ Transit is developing a pilot program to lend Amtrak some of their workforce to assist with some repairs during outages.\n\nIf Amtrak and NJ Transit can come to agreements on outages, manpower and prioritizing new projects, the final hurdle will be paying for it, which will lead to a different debate: money.\n\nShould NJ Transit's annual payments to Amtrak be used for what it considers to be state-of-good-repair work, like upgrading catenary and signals? Or, as Amtrak's Gardner and Williams have said, will more money be needed from New Jersey because some of NJ Transit's annual state-of-good-repair money is going to construction payments on Portal North Bridge?\n\nImproving trickle-up communication\n\nOne critical area everyone agrees needs work is to improve communications to customers when unexpected outages occur.\n\nFor Amtrak, it's getting information from the ground-level once a problem is identified and into the devices of customers on stalled trains or waiting on platforms.\n\n\"Until we get people at these locations and can verify what occurred and are actually starting to fix it, we don't have a good feel for how long this is going to be,\" Williams said. \"We have to figure out how to communicate despite that and give our customers as much information as we can.\"\n\nNJ Transit is also often in the dark during incidents like what occurred on May 22. That delays agency officials from communicating to their customers about whether delayed trains get canceled, making plans for cross-honoring with PATH, preparing staff at Hoboken or Port Authority Bus Terminal for a deluge of customers, or setting up emergency bus service between stops.\n\nCorbett said the working group will also try to develop a system so NJ Transit can send people out with Amtrak when an incident occurs so they can get information up the chain faster.\n\n\"We want to be in there with them at the incident so we can communicate out,\" Corbett said. \"We're having further meetings about how to really drill that down so that it's not just ad hoc response, but to be ahead of the curve, rather than us waiting and pressing them usually under a heated sense of urgency.\"\n\nWithout information, Michelle said, tempers rise as crowds swell in overcrowded New York Penn Station or when frustrated commuters are racing one another to board packed buses and PATH trains.\n\n\"If they don't improve communication, I'm genuinely concerned for the welfare of the public-facing NJ Transit employees that have to deal with the worst complainers and don't get home for hours right along with us -- especially when the fare hikes go into effect, people are going to be fuming,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "northjersey.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "North

Midtown Direct trains are being diverted to Hoboken station and tickets are being cross-honored by private carrier buses and the Port Authority Path Trains. Amtrak said that all trains traveling through Penn Station are expected to be delayed by as much as 90 minutes.\n\nNJ Transit is working with Amtrak to resolve the issue and determine the root cause, a spokesperson for the New Jersey authority said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe rail structure that runs up and down the US East Coast comes to a choke point at the border of New York and New Jersey.

Riders reported being more than an hour late to work and said there was no warning whatsoever from NJ Transit.\n\nPoliticians at the Elizabeth ribbon cutting, however, praised NJ Transit's service. \"Take the train,\" said State Senator Joseph Cryan. \"It'll be there.

Phil Murphy's administration calls for spending $100 million to create mixed-use, transit-oriented developments on properties currently owned by New Jersey Transit.\n\nIf lawmakers agree, the new real-estate venture would be led by the state Economic Development Authority, using money from a proposed new tax on New Jersey's most profitable corporations that Murphy wants enacted by the end of the month.\n\nBut the fate of that proposed corporate tax, as well as the exact composition of the state's next annual budget, remains uncertain with less than two weeks left before the start of a new fiscal year.\n\nAfter months of public hearings, final budget negotiations are now happening behind closed doors, with funding for direct property-tax relief programs favored by top legislative leaders among the issues still hanging in the balance.\n\nA new budget must be in place on July 1, or New Jersey's Constitution requires state government to shut down.\n\nMurphy, a second-term Democrat, sent lawmakers an updated draft of the fiscal year 2025 budget that incorporated the latest revenue forecasts from the Department of Treasury in mid-May.\n\nSince then, the majority Democrats in both houses have yet to introduce a final spending bill. Also yet to be introduced is any related legislation that would have to be signed into law before July 1, such as the bill needed to enact the new business tax Murphy envisions as a $1 billion source of revenue for the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nKey officials from the Murphy administration late last week outlined the $100 million proposal seeking to stimulate mixed-use, transit-oriented developments adjacent to NJ Transit train stations. Under the plan, the EDA would use the $100 million appropriation to purchase properties owned by NJ Transit throughout the state at fair market value, the officials said.\n\nFrom there, the EDA's real-estate expertise would be tapped so the properties could be transformed into \"mixed-use, transit-oriented developments that will spur economic activity and increase walkability near transit lines while also creating a direct revenue source for the mass transit agency,\" according to a news release issued by the administration.\n\nUltimately, the properties could be put up for bid, for purchase or lease, by developers, either as a whole or individually, according to the administration's proposal.\n\nA complete list of properties that would be sold by NJ Transit has yet to be identified, but surface parking lots were cited as one example.\n\nWith NJ Transit planning to move into a new headquarters in Newark by spring of next year, officials indicated the agency's current headquarters, which is also located in Newark, could also be eyed for redevelopment under the initiative.\n\nAccording to Murphy's original fiscal year 2025 budget proposal, put forward by the governor in late February, a new tax on companies with more than $10 million in net annual income would generate $1 billion to help balance a record-high $56 billion spending plan.\n\nUnder the proposal floated late last week, a $100 million share of the revenue from the proposed new tax, if enacted, would go to NJ Transit in fiscal year 2025, instead of all of the money going into the state budget's general fund.\n\nFrom there, Murphy has proposed using revenue from the proposed new tax in future fiscal years as a dedicated source of funding for NJ Transit, which is raising fares on July 1, but still facing a more than $750 million projected operating deficit in fiscal year 2026, according to agency budget documents.\n\nAsked why the real-estate initiative has to advance now, at the same time the new state budget is being worked out, the officials pointed to the current real-estate market, as well as the nexus to the proposed new tax that Murphy wants enacted by the end of the month.\n\n\"This is the moment to do something big like this,\" said EDA chief executive officer Tim Sullivan. \"It's part of the rationale for stepping on the accelerator now.\"\n\n\"It's a good time to capture the market while it's hot,\" said NJ Transit president and chief executive officer Kevin Corbett.\n\nAsked why the agencies are only looking to tap the funding that would be generated by the new tax, instead of some other revenue source, Sullivan said \"there's not another $100 million laying around that I'm aware of that we can use for this.\"", "source": {"uri":

Unique touches of the city can be seen throughout the renovated building interior and along the fencing, including the iconic arches that support the tracks and a nearby church that dates to the 17th century.\n\nWhat did officials say?\n\n\"The members of the city council worked together to make sure this area gets revitalized -- there's a 280-unit housing complex just to my left ... attracting people who can use this train station,\" Bollwage said. \"The (Department of Environmental Protection) in New Jersey just informed us last week that they're going to work with us and purchase 5.5 acres from NJ Transit in order to create open space and a pedestrian walkway to the train station.\"\n\nState Sen. Joe Cryan, who lives in Union and represents Elizabeth, reminded the crowd that getting this station completed was a years-long process and among the many projects the community has had to fight to get funded. Lengthy waiting and pushing to get overdue repairs and accessibility upgrades was also a theme of a NJ Transit groundbreaking last month at Brick Church Station in East Orange that is set to receive $83 million in improvements after persistent community advocacy.\n\nPlans to renovate the Elizabeth Train Station were first unveiled in 2015 when the project was estimated to cost $55 million. The project stalled amid disputes with then-Gov. Chris Christie over how the renovation would be paid for. The project ended up costing $74.5 million and opened two years after construction was estimated to be completed in 2022, but by the time of publication NJ Transit had not provided an explanation about the increased cost or construction delays. Annual federal formula funds were used to pay for $58 million of the project. An emailed question about what source of funds covered the remaining $16.5 million was not yet answered.\n\n\"This one took a while ... (but) the reality is that you never wavered on this commitment,\" Cryan said to Corbett. \"The experience is a thousand, thousand times better and for the city it means a thousand more opportunities to grow, to connect and to show off the best city in the state of New Jersey.\"\n\nTrenton makes: Murphy's corporate transit fee proposal to pay for NJ Transit may be getting complicated\n\nMore than $6B spent on Murphy's watch\n\nSince Murphy became governor, with Corbett at the helm, NJ Transit has advanced nearly $6 billion in construction and capital upgrades throughout the statewide system of buses, trains, light rail and disability van services, which is up from just $60 million in hard-money contracts during the last year of Christie's administration.\n\n\"NJT is currently at work on 20 on rail stations in active stages of development, ranging from construction to additional planning ... by far the largest investment in our system than in any similar period in the 40-year history of NJ Transit,\" Corbett said.\n\nBut the agency has a deep backlog of overdue projects, accessibility renovations, and upgrades to more advanced technology like electric buses or expansions of the system, like bringing the light rail into Bergen County or increasing capacity into New York Penn Station. That problem is exacerbated annually when the governor and Legislature siphon hundreds of millions from NJ Transit's tight capital budget to pay for operating expenses.\n\nInvestment in transit, Corbett said, \"not only does it make commuter life experience better, but it improves property values, it benefits well beyond just the station by means of transforming this neighborhood.\"",

The announcement comes one day after the Dallas City Council approved a two-year, $592,000 subsidy for Fair Park's operators to secure a contract with the team to call the Cotton Bowl Stadium home.\n\nAdvertisementAdvertisement\n\n\"To Dallas, we are humbled and excited to bring this new chapter of professional women's soccer to the most impressive sports city in the world,\" said Dallas Trinity FC CEO Jim Neil, whose family owns the team, before a crowd of several hundred at Klyde Warren Park. \"We will do our best to make the city proud of your great new club.\"\n\nSports Roundup\n\nGet the latest D-FW sports news, analysis, scores and more.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nCharlie Neil, the team's president, said the team is named after the Trinity River, which runs through North Texas; the team's logo is a Pegasus, the city's unofficial mascot; and the team's colors are maroon and gold in homage to Texas' sunrises and prairies.\n\nAmong the several hundred in the crowd for the unveiling were Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson, interim City Manager Kimberly Bizor Tolbert, USL Super League president Amanda Vandervort, Dallas Mavericks CEO Cynt Marshall, and at least seven Dallas City Council members.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe USL Super League is a new women's pro soccer league kicking off in August with eight teams and plans to expand to include at least two more for their second season. The new league will rival the National Women's Soccer League, which was created in 2012. The only Texas team in the NWSL is based in Houston.\n\nThe USL Super League's schedule has matches running from August to December, with a midseason break that runs through January and then more games from February to May.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe USL Super League has already announced other teams in Brooklyn, N.Y.; Charlotte, N.C.; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Lexington, Ky.; Spokane, Wash.; Tampa, Fla.; and Washington, D.C.\n\nAdvertisementDream realized\n\nJim Neil announced Chris Petrucelli, who was fired as coach of the NWSL's Chicago Red Stars in October, as Dallas Trinity FC's general manager. No players have been announced as signed as of before the brand unveiling. Neil called the team \"a dream realized.\"\n\n\"The current momentum behind women's sports is undeniable,\" he said. \"And Dallas, as the greatest sports city in America, is perfectly positioned to champion and embrace our new professional women's soccer team.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeil told council members on Wednesday that the franchise was negotiating with Dallas College for possible practice field space. The team aims to run youth clinics and tournaments and intends to have more than half of its employees be women and also seek women and people of color as minority team owners, he said.\n\nUnder the approved city proposal, Dallas will give the subsidy to Fair Park's management firm Oak View Group, which would also continue to book the stadium during days the venue isn't reserved for the soccer team. The proposed resolution ahead of Wednesday's vote described the yearly $296,000 as an event subsidy payment that amounts to $18,500 per game, but it's not immediately clear what the full terms of the team's agreement to play in the stadium are or if other city incentives are being offered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Cotton Bowl Stadium is undergoing about $140 million in renovations expected to be complete by the 2025 State Fair of Texas that fall. Improvements to restrooms, concession stands, seats and new escalators are among the upgrades planned for the stadium. The construction began in March.\n\nThe move marks the second time in as many months that the City Council has approved a deal to bring a professional women's sports team to Dallas. On April 24, the City Council approved a 15-year, $19 million deal for the WNBA's Dallas Wings to relocate from Arlington to downtown Dallas. The proposal, which still has to be approved by the WNBA's Board of Governors, would see the Wings play at Dallas Memorial Auditorium starting in 2026.\n\nJohnson said the city was committed to supporting the pro sports industry, citing the industry's ability to attract visitors, strengthen the city's economic portfolio and spark economic development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Bringing new sports teams to Dallas is critical to continuing our positive momentum as a world-class city and it shows people across the globe that this city is booming,\" the mayor said.\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreDallas interim city manager: Cities should 'go home' if interested in Chief Eddie Garc\u00edaDallas approves deal to bring new women's pro soccer team to Cotton Bowl StadiumDallas moving forward with plan to entice residents to switch from gas-powered lawn tools Dallas moved city workers into an unpermitted building.

(And Maybe It Is Not.)", "body": "On Wednesday, the City Council will vote on a deal to bring a professional sports team to the Cotton Bowl. Could this be the mysterious Project X?\n\nWhen the mysterious \"Project X\" appeared on a Dallas City Council committee agenda in late March, we (along with a lot of other people) began guessing about who it involved. Council members were tight-lipped because the discussion involved attorneys and was held in closed session.\n\nMaybe the Ad Hoc Committee on Professional Sports Recruitment and Retention and the Council Economic Development Committee was discussing strategies to keep the Mavs in town past their 2030 lease end with American Airlines Center.\n\nOr maybe Mayor Eric Johnson's interest in the negotiations around the Kansas City Chiefs' stadium in Kansas City was a Dallas Texans shaped clue.\n\nAnd then the city announced that the Dallas Wings would move from Arlington to Dallas, where they will begin playing at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center Memorial Arena after the 2025 season. That was surely Project X, right?\n\nNo. No it was not. The Ad Hoc Committee on Professional Sports Recruitment and Retention had another meeting about Project X last week. We confirmed then that Project X was not Wings-related. We entertained a few other potential theories -- another MLS franchise, or maybe cricket.\n\nBut maybe our long local speculation is finally at an end. The Council is set to vote on a deal that would allow a new professional sports team to use the Cotton Bowl for its season, with the city providing an annual subsidy \"not to exceed $296,000 per year\" for the next two years to Fair Park First and operators Oak View Group for expenses related to accommodating the new team.\n\nThe resolution the Council will vote on doesn't name the team, but the Dallas Morning News floated the idea that it was the Dallas franchise for a new women's pro-soccer league -- the USL Super League. Nobody would comment on the record, and when we asked the PR firm associated with the as-yet unnamed Dallas club if this was Project X and if the team would be calling the Cotton Bowl home, but they also could not confirm that Project X and the Dallas USL Super League team were one and the same.\n\n\"It's my understanding that Project X has been used historically to refer to different projects through the years,\" said Angela Lang with Tony Fay PR.\n\nHere's what we do know:\n\nThe franchise, which is owned by the Neil family, will reveal the team name, logo, and more details during an event at Klyde Warren Park Thursday morning. We profiled the Neils last summer.\n\nThe league has been teasing a big announcement on Twitter with the hashtag \"NewBootsInTown.\" It features a countdown to Thursday, and the numbers are photos of Dallas locations, including Deep Ellum, Fair Park, Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge, and the Pegasus.\n\nThe Cotton Bowl has hosted soccer before -- FC Dallas played there for six years straight, and then for parts of 2004 and 2005. More recently, it hosted a game between FC Barcelona and Club America last year and Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate vs. C.F. Monterrey and a game between FC Dallas and Inter Miami FC in January.\n\nSo far, the Dallas team has not signed any players, according to the league's signing tracker.\n\nIn addition to Dallas-Fort Worth, the first season will include teams from Charlotte, North Carolina; Lexington, Kentucky; Phoenix; Spokane, Washington; Tampa Bay, Florida; Tucson, Arizona; and Washington D.C. Subsequent seasons will add teams from Chattanooga, Tennessee; Indianapolis; Jacksonville, Florida; Madison, Wisconsin; and Oakland, California.\n\nHowever, there is one big reason why the council's Wednesday vote may not be about soccer at all. The Cotton Bowl is currently undergoing extensive renovations that will be complete by the fall of 2025. The USL Super League plans to kick off its inaugural season in August of this year, which likely means that if the Dallas franchise is the team headed for the Cotton Bowl, it'll need to find temporary quarters for its first season and part of the second.\n\nIn conclusion, this could be Project X, or it could be another red herring. The unnamed sports team moving into the Cotton Bowl may be Dallas' newest women's soccer team, or it could be someone else entirely. But speculating is fun, right?\n\nAnd, before we leave you, some clarity around the MLS idea we floated. FC Dallas holds the market rights, which means MLS couldn't expand or relocate another team to the North Texas market. They're staying put in Frisco, and the next expansion will be San Diego -- not Dallas proper.", "source": {"uri": "dmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "D Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bethany_erickson@dmagazine.com", "name": "Bethany Erickson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_X_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Project X (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_Bowl_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cotton Bowl (stadium)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USL_Super_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USL Super League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Bailey_Hutchison_Convention_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Dallas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Dallas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Dallas Morning News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klyde_Warren_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klyde Warren Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hunt_Hill_Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas\u2013Fort_Worth_metroplex", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Texas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of North Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Club Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.F._Monterrey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "C.F.

The stadium also hosted matches for the 1994 World Cup.\n\nThe team returned to the stadium for a game against Lionel Messi and Inter Miami in January.\n\nThere is also a renovation project underway to upgrade the historic stadium.\n\nThe $140 million project is part of the largest investment in Fair Park's 137-year history.\n\nThe goal is to turn the Cotton Bowl, which opened in 1930, into a modern stadium for many more year-round concerts, soccer games, and events.\n\nCrooke says the challenge is getting the community to buy in.\n\n\"The NWSL had a good start and had the benefits of having the ownership of US soccer to help bullet through tougher times to get us to the place where we are celebrating the Alex Morgans, the Megan Rapinoes,\" said Crooke.\n\nThe USL has already

The subsidy would offset $18,500 of about $55,000 in expenses per event in the Cotton Bowl, the city documents say.\n\nAnother professional sports team, the WNBA's Dallas Wings, is also soon to call the city of Dallas home, with the city council approving a 15-year deal to move the franchise from the University of Texas at Arlington's College Park Center to the Dallas Memorial Auditorium, part of the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center downtown.\n\nWings CEO Greg Bibb and city officials also said they see the Wings' move as a catalyst for drawing other businesses to the area as the city moves forward with a larger redevelopment project anchored by a new convention center to replace the aging Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center. The city plans to renovate the auditorium as part of the project.\n\nBringing pro sports inside the city limits has been a key focus of city officials. Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson in 2022, who has long floated the idea of an NFL team in the city of Dallas, formed a new city council committee focused on professional sports recruitment and retention.\n\nThis comes as the Cotton Bowl is undergoing a major refresh. In December, the city of Dallas agreed to make $140 million in investments to the stadium as part of the deal to keep the University of Texas and University of Oklahoma's annual football game at the venue for another decade.

One of the biggest hurdles: filling the iconic, 93-year-old Cotton Bowl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It will certainly be a big challenge, but we are very excited to be able to face it,\" said Jim Neil, CEO and owner of Dallas Trinity FC, during the club's presentation at Klyde Warren Park.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDallas Trinity FC's arrival on the local scene comes as women's soccer has become a national passion.\n\nSports Roundup\n\nGet the latest D-FW sports news, analysis, scores and more.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe USWNT is the world's most successful squad, winning four Women's World Cup titles (1991, 1999, 2015, and 2019), four Olympic gold medals (1996, 2004, 2008, and 2012), nine Concacaf W Championship titles and one Concacaf Gold Cup title.\n\nWomen's sports are expected to become even bigger. Deloitte, a financial analysis company, forecasts that in 2024, for the first time, women's elite sports will generate a revenue that surpasses $1 billion -- a 300% increase on the industry's evaluation in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Women's sports has been exploding for the last 20 years, but really big in the last 3 or 4 years,\" Neil said. \"Women's sports have been exploding throughout the world and soccer is the most successful and most popular sport in the world.\"\n\nThe Dallas City Council on Wednesday approved a two-year, $592,000 subsidy for the operators of Fair Park to secure a contract with the USL Super League team to play home games. There is an option for the $296,000 annual subsidy to continue for a third season.\n\nOn April 24, the City Council approved a 15-year, $19 million deal for the WNBA's Dallas Wings to relocate from Arlington to downtown Dallas. The proposal, which still has to be approved by the WNBA's Board of Governors, would see the Wings play at Dallas Memorial Auditorium starting in 2026.\n\nAdvertisementAdvertisement\n\nThe USL Super League's schedule has matches from August to December, with a midseason break that runs through January and then more games from February to May.\n\nNeil hopes that in his first season, the team will be able to draw an average of 12,000 fans per game in a stadium with a capacity of 90,000 fans.\n\nThe challenge of creating an electric and exciting atmosphere for fans and players inside the stadium is Neal's first big concern.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's important that the stadium doesn't look empty,\" said Neal, who plans to concentrate all the fans in a section of the lower part of the Cotton Bowl.\n\nOnly the lower portion of the Cotton Bowl will be open for Dallas Trinity games, which will play their home games on Saturdays or Sundays and occasionally on Wednesdays.\n\nThe league hasn't announced the schedule for its inaugural season.\n\nUnlike the National Women's Soccer League, which was founded in 2012 and currently has 14 teams, the USL Super League will play on the \"fall-to-summer\" soccer calendar traditionally followed worldwide. This will ensure that players can represent both their club and their national team and allow clubs to actively participate in the emerging global women's transfer market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother difference is that the USL Super League does not have a draft, which means that the owners of each team are free to sign the players they want to have in their clubs.\n\nDallas Trinity FC will play under the primary colors of sunrise maroon, prairie gold and live oak green.\n\nThe colors were inspired by the city skyline and the Trinity River. The team's shield is a Pegasus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother challenge that Dallas Trinity FC and the USL Super League will face in their first season will be name recognition.\n\n\"The biggest challenge is getting the word out,\" said USL Super League President Amanda Vandervort.\n\n\"We want to make sure people know what we're building. We want fans to take this a great opportunity to come out and support their professional women's teams,\" Vandervort said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe USL Super League is not intended to rival the National Women's Soccer League, Neil said.\n\n\"We aspire to be as competitive and as talented as the NWSL.\" Neil Said, \"Think about what's going on in America right now. There are 101 men's professional teams but only 22 women's professional teams. There's tremendous potential to meet the growing demand for the women's game.\"\n\nNeil, a successful real estate businessman, co-founder and CEO of Churchill Capital Company, believes that this was the right moment to enter the world of women's professional soccer.\n\n\"Women's soccer is the most successful women's sport in the world, and if women's soccer is going to be successful in the world, there needs to be a team in Dallas,\" Neil said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo view subscription options for The News and SportsDay, click here.", "source": {"uri": "dallasnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Wednesday, the city council will decide whether a sports team can use the 90,000-seat Cotton Bowl in Fair Park.\n\nLeaders for the DFW team of the USL Super League professional women's team will hold an event on Thursday at Klyde Warren Park to detail their plans. They aim to start playing by the summer. In city records, the deal council will vote on Wednesday will also allow a team to start playing in the summer.\n\nA flyer for the \"Brand Reveal Celebration for Dallas' First Women's Professional Soccer Team\" states the CEO of USL Super League Dallas, Jim Neil, and the President of USL Super League President Amanda Vandervort will give remarks.\n\nA spokeswoman for the city did not confirm the two items were related but said more details would become available at the city council meeting on Wednesday.\n\nSlick promotional videos are already online touting a new women's team in Dallas, featuring the city's skyline prominently in the videos.\n\nThe voice-over says the USL Super League is, \"Built for the future of women's soccer, bridging the journey from youth to pro, connected to the global game.\"\n\nWednesday, according to the city council agenda and associated documents, city leaders will vote on a nearly $600,000 two-year agreement. The paperwork says a pro-sports team wants to play in the Cotton Bowl and the Fair Park operator, Oak View Group, has negotiated an agreement with the team to start their season this summer.\n\nThe USL Super League season also starts this summer.\n\nThe sports and entertainment market in North Texas is already jam-packed. What will this new team need to succeed?\n\n\"You have to have an owner that's willing to lose money, quite frankly. No one starts a team and makes money right away. That just doesn't happen. And you've got to be committed,\" said longtime Dallas Mavericks radio broadcaster Chuck Cooperstein, who's seen his fair share of team ideas come and go over his forty-year career.\n\nCooperstein tells NBC 5 that using the Cotton Bowl for professional soccer has pros and cons. The pros: it's available, soccer ready, and says the field and operators are \"fantastic.\" The downside? It's big. Really big. Even if soccer games dramatically overperform at 20,000 people attending, the 90,000-seat stadium will still be mostly empty. That appearance may hamper the fan and athletic experience.\n\nHowever, Cooperstein says this is the best time in years to make a run at a women's professional sports team. The Caitlin Clark effect\" has supercharged the WNBA and women's World Cup soccer has been increasing the sports viewing numbers and jersey sales.\n\nNorth Texas had three high school girls' soccer teams win state championships this Spring: Prosper ISD in 6A, Frisco-Wakeland in 5A, and Celina ISD in 4A.\n\n\"Knowing that women's sports is on a run right now - I mean - they're on a real run with the women's world cup team that's been incredibly popular,\" said Cooperstein, \"There's a lot of juice in women's sports right now and it will just be interesting to see if they are able to capitalize on it.\"\n\nThe Cotton Bowl at Fair Park is also undergoing more than $100 million in renovations set to be completed by the state fair in 2025.", "source": {"uri": "nbcdfw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USL_Super_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USL Super League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_Bowl_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cotton Bowl (stadium)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fair Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Professional_Soccer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's Professional Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas\u2013Fort_Worth_metroplex", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klyde_Warren_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Klyde Warren Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_View_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oak View Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Texas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of North Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Cooperstein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Cooperstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Women's_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Women's World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radio broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Youth and High School", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://media.nbcdfw.com/2022/02/shutterstock_231079462.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547836", "eventUri": "eng-9547836", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

As of Wednesday's council meeting, the team's name hadn't been revealed, but it will start using the South Dallas facility in August.\n\nThe Dallas City Council -- except for one absent member -- voted unanimously to approve a nearly $600,000 two-year subsidy contract between the team and Fair Park, where the Cotton Bowl is located.\n\nThe agreement will be overseen by Fair Park First, the nonprofit organization that runs the South Dallas facility, and Oak View Group (OVG), an asset management firm that also oversees the city's convention center.\n\nThe approval comes a few weeks after the council also approved a contract to bring the Dallas Wings professional women's basketball team to the Dallas Memorial Auditorium, part of the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center.\n\nThe vote also comes amidst allegations of misappropriating funds contributed to Fair Park First against OVG. A financial audit and investigation are currently underway into how those funds were used.\n\nThe new team will be part of the United Soccer League's Super League. Eight inaugural teams from cities including Brooklyn, N.Y., Charlotte, N.C., and Spokane, Washington will launch in August. According to the group's website the league could grow to 20 teams by 2026.\n\n\"I think we all know about the momentum behind women's sports is really undeniable right now, Dallas is really at the forefront of this movement,\" Executive Director of the Dallas Sports Commission Monica Paul said during Wednesday's meeting.\n\n\"As more attention and investment flows into women's athletics including a [United Soccer League] team to call Fair Park home, Dallas will remain at the epicenter of embracing and positively influencing women's professional sports.\"\n\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth team is led by the Neil Family, which \"represents over 40 years\" in various industries including real estate investment banking, professional sports and advertising in North Texas, according to the team's website.\n\nJim Neil is the chief executive officer and co-founder of Churchill Capital Company, LLC -- a real estate investment banking firm. Neil and his family will be the majority owners of the new soccer team.\n\n\"Women's soccer is the number one women's sport in the world and we are really excited to be bringing that to Dallas,\" Neil said during the meeting. \"You can't have a successful sports league if Dallas doesn't have a team, and so this is really important to us and I think to the City of Dallas.\"\n\nThe deal was brokered by several city and elected officials including District 3 Council Member Zarin Gracey and District 7 Council Member Adam Bazaldua.\n\n\"The future is so bright in sunny South Dallas, and it's because of momentum we have here,\" Bazaldua said.\n\nBazaldua also revealed more on how the deal came together -- and who was involved.\n\n\"I also cannot ignore the fact that this deal was something that was brokered by a bunch of strong women,\" Bazaldua said. \"To know that we've got incredible women that are making things happen for our city to also highlight the diversity of women athletics to me is extremely important.\"\n\nWhile most of the council praised the contract, some still had questions about the deal moving forward.\n\n\"Its sunny news for sunny South Dallas, there's one little cloud,\" District 13 Council Member Gay Donnell Willis said. \"This agreement is with OVG, there have been some allegations and the city is undertaking an audit...so I think we need to look at this and ask the questions taxpayers would ask.\"\n\nIn early April, D Magazine reported that Fair Park First \"notified the city of financial concerns.\" OVG legal counsel said at the time the group \"vehemently\" denies \"any wrongdoing,\" according the article.\n\nShortly after The Dallas Morning News reported the nonprofit's board decided to oust it's CEO -- and then reversed that decision days later.\n\nRosa Fleming, the director of the city's convention and event services department, said over the last five years a new contract compliance and review process has been implemented.\n\n\"Regardless of what we do at the center...we ensure that we are spending it correctly that we can we have a good accounting,\" Fleming told the council. \"We ask for all of the backup data and before we pay an invoice we make sure we have done comparisons, if we have questions the invoice processing stops...so I am comfortable that this will go well.\"\n\nThe league will play a \"split season\" starting in August and ending in late December. Games would start up again in mid-February and run through May, according to city staff.\n\n\"The contract with this team will mark one of the many opportunities that we have to continue to foster economic growth and workforce development in South Dallas through our parks system,\" Interim City Manager Kimberly Tolbert said.\n\nGot a tip?

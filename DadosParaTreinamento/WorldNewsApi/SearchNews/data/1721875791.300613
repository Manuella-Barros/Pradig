In cities experiencing increasing traffic congestion, the Circle Train facility aims to create an integrated plan for Metro train operations.Yadav highlighted his discussions with the Railway Minister, focusing on the operation of Vande Metro trains at speeds surpassing traditional metro trains, the incorporation of state-of-the-art technology, and the potential advantages for industrial areas such as Pithampur and Dewas.Regarding the use of narrow-gauge and other existing railway lines in some cities, Yadav emphasised the need for comprehensive surveys and studies. This will ensure that currently unused rail tracks can be repurposed effectively.The meeting also reviewed the progress of the metro projects in the state. The trial run of the first phase of the Bhopal metro was completed in October last year, with the second and third phases set for completion by 2027. Additionally, work on a 31-kilometer-long metro line in Indore is actively underway.Published By: Ajmal Published On: Jun 23, 2024ALSO READ | Lord Ram, Krishna's teachings to be taught in MP schools, colleges, Congress reactsMust Watch", "summary": "<a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/madhya-pradesh-simhastha-kumbh-mela-ujjain-indore-vande-metro-trains-2556783-2024-06-23\"> <img align=\"left\" hspace=\"2\" height=\"180\" width=\"305\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/metro-train-233450368-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=ee3TImjOxhsL49KXYMFb.GdXL2U4nBml\"> </a> Vande Metro trains to run between Indore, Ujjain before next Kumbh Mela", "url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/madhya-pradesh-simhastha-kumbh-mela-ujjain-indore-vande-metro-trains-2556783-2024-06-23", "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/metro-train-233450368-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=ee3TImjOxhsL49KXYMFb.GdXL2U4nBml?size=1280:720", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 00:35:02", "author": "Press Trust of India", "authors": ["Press Trust of India"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.397}

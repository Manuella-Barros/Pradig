The young men were attacked during the early hours of the morning in the Easton area of the city. Avon and Somerset Police said the men, aged in their 20s, were rushed to hospital with knife injuries. One of them is in a serious condition. Investigating officers are appealing to the public for information. They are urging witnesses or anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area to get in touch immediately. Neighbourhood Policing Chief Inspector Scott Hill said: 'This is a significant incident and I am conscious there have been a number of similar incidents of this nature over the past few months. 'I also understand there is a great deal of concern among the community around knife crime. We remain dedicated to reducing serious violence and knife crime, especially among young people. Earlier this year, we launched a proactive operation targeting serious violence and knife crime and we are working closely with partners to identify and tackle the root causes. 'A police cordon remains in place in Beaumont Terrace and Rawnsley Park and officers will be providing an increased high-visibility presence in the area over the coming days. 'If you have any concerns or questions, please do speak to our officers out on patrol.' Avon and Somerset Police added: 'If you were in the Stapleton Road / Rawnsley Park area between 4.15-5am this morning and witnessed anything suspicious, or have any video footage which could aid our enquiries, please call us. If you can help, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number 5224148270, or complete our online appeals form.

No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court or have to speak to police when contacting Crimestoppers.' Since the start of the year, Bristol has faced a devastating wave of knife-related crimes involving children in the city. In January, two boys 16-year-old Max Dixon and 15-year-old Mason Rist were stabbed to death. Then in February, a boy, 16, was stabbed to death in a Bristol park. Following the bout of knife attacks, schoolchildren in the city have been showed how to use bleed kits. The kits contain items such as pads and bandages and can be used by pupils to stop blood loss before paramedics can arrive. Anti-knife campaigner Leanne Reynolds was tasked with showing the children how to use the kits. Ms Reynolds has been promoting the kits since the fatal stabbing of 18-year-old Dontae Davis in 2021. Speaking to Sky News in March she said: 'There's been a spike in serious violence. I'm a parent and I'm scared, so I'm trying to get these kits into schools and other organisations in Bristol and across the southwest. 'They could potentially save a life or limb before the ambulance gets there to take over.", "summary": "The young men were attacked during the early hours of the morning in the Easton area of the city.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13510703/Two-men-rushed-hospital-stab-wounds-knife-attack-Bristol-police-arrest-nine-people-suspicion-attempted-murder.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/09/13/85895949-0-image-m-39_1717936618633.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:35:33", "author": "Ed Holt,Editor", "authors": ["Ed Holt", "Editor"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.108}

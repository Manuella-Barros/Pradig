PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Nelson Cruz didn't quite know what to make of his 30th home run, which put a charge into the ninth inning of the Seattle Mariners' 7-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays on Friday night.\n\nThe distance of the solo blast into the upper deck was measured by MLB Statcast as 482 feet, which makes it the longest ever measured at Tropicana Field.\n\n\"Cool. Do they give a prize for that?\" asked Cruz, who also had two doubles and scored three runs for the Mariners in the first game of a 12-game trip.\n\nMLB Statcast has been measuring home runs only in the last three seasons. Some players doubt the validity of the measurements, and some of the Mariners had doubts whether it was even Cruz's longest homer. But catcher Mike Zunino, who had two doubles and drove in two runs, said \"you could have told me 500 (feet) and I would have believed it.\"\n\nCruz acknowledged that he \"squared it up pretty good, yeah.\"\n\nErasmo Ramirez won his first game for the Mariners since April 1, 2014.\n\nRamirez, who was traded back to the Mariners on July 28 after pitching 2 1/2 seasons with the Rays, gave up one run and two hits in six innings, leaving the game with a 6-1 lead.\n\n\"It feels weird because it's no more than a month, but ... we have to fight for the playoffs so I cannot just come in here and give up,\" Ramirez (5-4) said. \"I have a lot of friends on the other side, but at the same time it's a game and I have to play for my team at this moment.\"\n\nHits by Robinson Cano, Cruz, Danny Valencia and Ben Gamel helped the Mariners score three runs in the first off Rays starter Austin Pruitt. Back-to-back doubles by Guillermo Heredia and Zunino and a single by Jean Segura brought in two more runs and made it 5-0 in the third.\n\nCruz's home run off reliever Brad Boxberger drove in Seattle's final run in the ninth.\n\n\"It's great when he gets hot because they're not just singles, they're doubles and homers,\" Mariners manager Scott Servais said.\n\nPruitt (6-4) gave up six runs and 11 hits in seven innings, throwing 107 pitches in his sixth major league start.\n\nKevin Kiermaier, playing for the first time since fracturing his hip on June 8, led off the sixth with a double off Ramirez and scored Tampa Bay's run on a sacrifice fly.\n\n\"A long wait for that to happen again, but hopefully you'll see plenty more of that in the next month or so,\" Kiermaier said.\n\nWilson Ramos had three hits for the Rays, who lost for the seventh time in eight games and fell four games below .500 (60-64) for the first time this season.\n\nKIERMAIER RETURNS IN LEADOFF SPOT\n\nKiermaier, back in the Rays' lineup for the first time in more than two months, led off because somebody had to on a team that has scored only 24 runs in its last 14 games. \"Why wouldn't he be the best option?\" asked manager Kevin Cash. \"We've tried some other guys up there, it just has not clicked for whatever reason.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMARINERS: 3B Kyle Seager lost about 12 pounds while missing two games with a stomach virus, and \"he still looks pretty thin,\" according to Servais. ... OF Jarrod Dyson (strained groin) said he felt better Friday, but Servais wanted to give him another day off. ... Heredia was in the lineup after negative X-rays on a forearm that got hit by a pitch.\n\nRAYS: RHP Matt Andriese (stress reaction, right hip) took a ground ball off his shin and left Friday's rehab start at Class-A Charlotte after just two pitches.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMariners LHP Ariel Miranda (7-6) will face Rays RHP Jake Odorizzi (6-6) on Saturday night. Miranda pitched the only complete game of his career and Seattle's only complete game of the season against the Rays on June 4, a 7-1 Mariners victory.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Nelson Cruz didn't quite know what to make of his 30th home run, which put a charge into the ninth inning of the Seattle Mariners' 7-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays on Friday night.\n\nThe distance of the solo blast into the upper deck was measured by MLB Statcast as 482 feet, which makes it the longest ever measured at Tropicana Field.\n\n\"Cool. Do they give a prize for that?\" asked Cruz, who also had two doubles and scored three runs for the Mariners in the first game of a 12-game trip.\n\nMLB Statcast has been measuring home runs only in the last three seasons. Some players doubt the validity of the measurements, and some of the Mariners had doubts whether it was even Cruz's longest homer. But catcher Mike Zunino, who had two doubles and drove in two runs, said \"you could have told me 500 (feet) and I would have believed it.\"\n\nSponsored Content: How is your agency managing and maximizing its data? Share your opinions in a Federal News Radio survey.\n\nCruz acknowledged that he \"squared it up pretty good, yeah.\"\n\nErasmo Ramirez won his first game for the Mariners since April 1, 2014.\n\nRamirez, who was traded back to the Mariners on July 28 after pitching 2 1/2 seasons with the Rays, gave up one run and two hits in six innings, leaving the game with a 6-1 lead.\n\n\"It feels weird because it's no more than a month, but ... we have to fight for the playoffs so I cannot just come in here and give up,\" Ramirez (5-4) said. \"I have a lot of friends on the other side, but at the same time it's a game and I have to play for my team at this moment.\"\n\nHits by Robinson Cano, Cruz, Danny Valencia and Ben Gamel helped the Mariners score three runs in the first off Rays starter Austin Pruitt. Back-to-back doubles by Guillermo Heredia and Zunino and a single by Jean Segura brought in two more runs and made it 5-0 in the third.\n\nCruz's home run off reliever Brad Boxberger drove in Seattle's final run in the ninth.\n\nGSA gives per diem travel rates another bump for 2018\n\n\"It's great when he gets hot because they're not just singles, they're doubles and homers,\" Mariners manager Scott Servais said.\n\nPruitt (6-4) gave up six runs and 11 hits in seven innings, throwing 107 pitches in his sixth major league start.\n\nKevin Kiermaier, playing for the first time since fracturing his hip on June 8, led off the sixth with a double off Ramirez and scored Tampa Bay's run on a sacrifice fly.\n\n\"A long wait for that to happen again, but hopefully you'll see plenty more of that in the next month or so,\" Kiermaier said.\n\nWilson Ramos had three hits for the Rays, who lost for the seventh time in eight games and fell four games below .500 (60-64) for the first time this season.\n\nKIERMAIER RETURNS IN LEADOFF SPOT\n\nKiermaier, back in the Rays' lineup for the first time in more than two months, led off because somebody had to on a team that has scored only 24 runs in its last 14 games. \"Why wouldn't he be the best option?\" asked manager Kevin Cash. \"We've tried some other guys up there, it just has not clicked for whatever reason.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMARINERS: 3B Kyle Seager lost about 12 pounds while missing two games with a stomach virus, and \"he still looks pretty thin,\" according to Servais. ... OF Jarrod Dyson (strained groin) said he felt better Friday, but Servais wanted to give him another day off. ... Heredia was in the lineup after negative X-rays on a forearm that got hit by a pitch.\n\nRAYS: RHP Matt Andriese (stress reaction, right hip) took a ground ball off his shin and left Friday's rehab start at Class-A Charlotte after just two pitches.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMariners LHP Ariel Miranda (7-6) will face Rays RHP Jake Odorizzi (6-6) on Saturday night. Miranda pitched the only complete game of his career and Seattle's only complete game of the season against the Rays on June 4, a 7-1 Mariners victory.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T04:15:00Z",

PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Nelson Cruz hit two doubles and his 30th home run Friday night and Erasmo Ramirez won his first game for the Seattle Mariners since April 1, 2014, a 7-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nCruz's home run was measured by MLB Statcast at 482 feet, the longest in Tropicana Field history.\n\nRamirez (5-4), who was traded back to the Mariners on July 28 after pitching 2 1/2 seasons with the Rays, gave up one run and two hits in six innings in the first game of the Mariners' 12-game trip.\n\nHits by Robinson Cano, Cruz, Danny Valencia and Ben Gamel helped the Mariners score three runs in the first off Rays starter Austin Pruitt.\n\nBack-to-back doubles by Guillermo Heredia and Mike Zunino and a single by Jean Segura brought in two more runs and made it 5-0 in the third.\n\nCruz's solo home run off reliever Brad Boxberger drove in Seattle's final run in the ninth.\n\nPruitt (6-4) gave up six runs and 11 hits in seven innings, throwing 107 pitches in his sixth major league start.\n\nKevin Kiermaier, playing for the first time since fracturing his hip on June 8, led off the sixth with a double off Ramirez and scored Tampa Bay's run on a ground ball.\n\nWilson Ramos had three hits for the Rays, who lost for the seventh time in eight games and fell four games below .500 (60-64) for the first time this season.\n\nKIERMAIER RETURNS IN LEADOFF SPOT\n\nKiermaier, back in the Rays' lineup for the first time in more than two months, led off because somebody had to. \"Why wouldn't he be the best option?\" asked manager Kevin Cash. \"We've tried some other guys up there, it just has not clicked for whatever reason.\" The Rays center fielder missed 62 games.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMARINERS: 3B Kyle Seager lost about 12 pounds while missing two games with a stomach virus, and \"he still looks pretty thin,\" according to manager Scott Servais. ... OF Jarrod Dyson (strained groin) said he felt better Friday, but Servais wanted to give him another day off. ... OF Guillermo Heredia was in the lineup after negative X-rays on a forearm that got hit by a pitch.\n\nRAYS: RHP Matt Andriese (stress reaction, right hip) took a ground ball off his shin and left Friday's rehab start at Class-A Charlotte after just two pitches.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMariners LHP Ariel Miranda (7-6) will face Rays RHP Jake Odorizzi (6-6) on Saturday night.

WATCH LIVE ON FOX SPORTS GO\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The Seattle Mariners continue to hover at .500, which is enough to remain in the thick of the American League wild-card chase with 40 games to play.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Rays, who host Seattle in the opener of a three-game series on Friday, are struggling to stay in the same conversation.\n\nWatch the Tampa Bay Rays on FOX Sports Sun Broadcast scheduleFOX Sports GoVIDEO: Rays news, interviews & featuresVIDEO: Rays baseball demonstrations\n\nSeattle (61-61) had Thursday off, after back-to-back wins over Baltimore to finish a 2-5 homestand. The Rays (60-63) have lost 10 of their last 13 after dropping three of four games at Toronto.\n\n\"That will put a few gray hairs on here,\" Mariners manager Scott Servais said while lifting his hat after a 7-6 win over Baltimore on Wednesday.\n\nEven as both teams scrap for wins, a three-game sweep would have either team back in postseason relevance, which is more than .500 baseball normally gives you in mid-August. A logjam of teams chasing the Los Angeles Angels for the final wild card are all close enough to play with added motivation -- though that hasn't helped either Seattle or Tampa Bay of late.\n\nSeattle will start right-hander Erasmo Ramirez against the team that dealt him away for reliever Steve Cishek last month.\n\nRamirez is 4-4 with a 4.73 ERA this season. He is 0-1 with a 4.40 ERA in three starts since returning to Seattle, where he pitched from 2012 to 2014.\n\nRamirez was sharp in his last outing, going six innings and holding the Angels to three hits and a single unearned run. If you go back to his earlier Mariners stint, he's 1-0 with a 2.16 ERA against the Rays.\n\nCishek has been stellar since coming to the Rays, who acquired him and veteran relievers Sergio Romo and Dan Jennings before the non-waiver trade deadline.\n\nIn nine games, he has yet to allow a run. He also has recorded nine strikeouts in nine innings.\n\nThe Rays' bullpen has been one of baseball's best in August, but their sputtering offense has made that largely a moot point.\n\nIn 13 games since Aug. 4, the Rays have totaled 23 runs. They are hitting .196 (82-for-419) overall and .105 (8-for-76) with runners in scoring position in those games.\n\n\"It's going to be frustrating until we figure out how to put something together,\" Rays third baseman Evan Longoria said Thursday after a 5-3 loss in Toronto. \"I wish I had an answer.\"\n\nLongoria was 2-for-3 Thursday but is hitting .196 (10-for-51) in his last 14 games since hitting for the cycle Aug. 1 at Houston. Before this slump, Longoria batted .361 (26-for-72) in his previous 18 contests.\n\nTo face Ramirez, the Rays will turn to their own 27-year-old right-hander, rookie Austin Pruitt, who struggled in the bullpen much of this season but has pitched well since joining the rotation. In his last three starts, he has a 1.96 ERA (four runs in 18 1/3 innings).\n\nHe still carries a 5.07 ERA for the season and a nicer looking 6-3 record. His only outing against Seattle came in relief and didn't go well, with three runs in 1 1/3 innings for a 20.25 ERA.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T14:26:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2159,

He limited the Angels to one unearned over six innings in his previous start.\n\n\"Every time, I'm feeling stronger,\" he said. \"I was able to keep my speed into the sixth inning (against the Angels). That was awesome to see. Being able to throw strikes in the sixth and have the same speed is something you're looking for.\"\n\nThe Mariners would take something similar this time around.\n\nRamirez is 0-1 with a 4.40 ERA in three starts since returning to the Mariners and 4-4 overall with a 4.73 ERA. Cishek has not allowed a run in nine innings over nine appearances for the Rays since the trade.\n\nThe Mariners are 61-61 and trail Los Angeles by 1 1/2 games in the race for the American League's final wild-card berth as they begin a 12-game trip through four cities. The good news? They are 19-9 on the road since late May.\n\nOther watchpoints:\n\n***Tampa Bay is starting rookie right-hander Austin Pruitt (6-3 with a 5.07 ERA) in the series opener at 4:10 p.m. Pacific time. Pruitt entered the rotation in late July and has allowed just four runs in 18 1/3 innings over his last three starts.\n\n***The Mariners swept a three-game series against the Rays when the clubs played June 2-4 at Safeco Field.\n\n***Tampa Bay (60-63) is 7-13 in its last 20 games and 11-19 in its last 30.\n\n***The Rays activated Kevin Kiermaier from the 60-day disabled list prior to the game. He's been out since June 8 because of a fractured hip. He was batting .258 with seven homers and 20 RBIs in 62 games prior to his injury.\n\n***Third baseman Kyle Seager's status remains uncertain. He traveled with the club to Tampa Bay but missed the last two games because of a stomach virus that resulted in a 12-pound weight loss.\n\n***Reliever David Phelps is scheduled to throw from a mound Friday for the first time since leaving an Aug. 6 game in Kansas City because of what was diagnosed as an impingement in his elbow. Barring setbacks, he could be activated within a few days.\n\n***The Mariners rank eighth in the American League in scoring at 4.69 runs per game, while the Rays are 13th at 4.29. The league average is 4.70. The Rays rank fourth among AL clubs with a 4.06 ERA. The Mariners are 10th at 4.50. The AL average is 4.37.\n\n***Nelson Cruz has seven homers in his last 11 games and leads the American League with 96 RBIs.\n\n***The Mariners have won seven of their last nine games at Tropicana Field and 10 of their last 15 -- after losing eight in a row.\n\n***The Mariners and Rays have been involved in 14 trades involving 40 players and one manager since Tampa Bay gained a franchise in 1998.\n\nTIME CAPSULE\n\nIt was 25 years ago Friday -- Aug. 18, 1992 -- that Jay Buhner became the first right-handed batter to hit a homer over the right-field scoreboard at Camden Yards in

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- A return home to Tropicana Field did little to slow down the Tampa Bay Rays' recent slump as the Seattle Mariners won their third straight game, opening a three-game series with a 7-1 win on Friday night at Tropicana Field.\n\nNelson Cruz crushed his 30th home run of the season in the ninth -- at 482 feet, the longest ever recorded at Tropicana Field -- and had two of the team's six doubles.\n\nMariners starter Erasmo Ramirez (5-4) faced the team that traded him away last month and held them to one run on three hits. Seattle (62-61) stayed in the American League wild-card chase while the Rays (60-64) dropped to a season-high four games under .500, having lost 11 of their last 14 overall and eight of their last 10 at home.\n\nTampa Bay starter Austin Pruitt found himself down 3-0 in a 33-pitch first inning, but helped the bullpen by lasting seven innings. He threw 107 pitches, 77 for strikes. Those strikes too often turned into Mariners hits -- they had 11, four more than Pruitt had allowed in any previous start. That included six doubles, with two each from Cruz and Mike Zunino.\n\nThe Rays, blanked five times in their previous eight home games, managed to avoid the shutout, thanks to Lucas Duda's sacrifice fly in the sixth inning. They have scored a total of 24 runs in their 3-11 slide, less than two runs per game. Catcher Wilson Ramos had three of Tampa Bay's four hits on Friday.\n\nA day after the Rays left 14 runners on base, they didn't have many opportunities to strand anyone. Two walks and a single loaded the bases with one out in the second inning, but Adeiny Hechavarria could only pop out to shallow center, not deep enough to send the runner at third, and Daniel Robertson popped out to right field to end the inning.\n\nFormer Rays pitcher Ramirez, acquired by the Mariners last month, Ramirez followed with three straight 1-2-3 innings before Kevin Kiermaier doubled to lead off the sixth.\n\nSeattle's bats had no such trouble, however, as they tagged Pruitt for three runs in the first inning. Nelson Cruz stroked an RBI double that Rays center fielder Kiermaier -- back for the first time in more than two months -- appeared to lose in the stadium's white roof. Kyle Seager followed with an RBI groundout and Danny Valencia made it 3-0 with an infield single.\n\nThe Mariners added two more runs in the fourth. Ben Gamel walked, Guillermo Heredia doubled and Zunino brought both in with a two-run double for a 5-0 lead.\n\nGamel added another run in the fifth with an RBI single.\n\nNOTES: Before the game, the Rays activated OF Kevin Kiermaier from the 60-day disabled list. He'd been sidelined since June 9 with a fractured hip, and the Rays optioned Mallex Smith to Triple-A Durham to make room. ... RHP Matt Andriese, making a rehab start in Class A Charlotte as he recovers from a hip injury, took a comebacker off his ankle in the first inning and left the game. ... Seattle not only came in at 61-61, but is 30-30 since starting the season 31-31. They went into the Rays series with an 8-8-2 record in road series. ... Friday's game kicks off a 14-day, 12-game road trip, Seattle's longest of the season and longest since 2010.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T02:45:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2654, "textStart":

(AP) -- Nelson Cruz hit two doubles and his 30th home run Friday night and Erasmo Ramirez won his first game for the Seattle Mariners since April 1, 2014, a 7-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nCruz's home run was measured by MLB Statcast at 482 feet, the longest in Tropicana Field history.\n\nRamirez (5-4), who was traded back to the Mariners on July 28 after pitching 2 1/2 seasons with the Rays, gave up one run and two hits in six innings in the first game of the Mariners' 12-game trip.\n\nHits by Robinson Cano, Cruz, Danny Valencia and Ben Gamel helped the Mariners score three runs in the first off Rays starter Austin Pruitt.\n\nSponsored Content: How is your agency managing and maximizing its data?

Meanwhile, the Rays (60-64) lost their third straight. Since winning three straight at Houston, the Rays have won just three times in their last 14 games to put a damper on their postseason hopes.\n\nThe Rays traded Ramirez to the Mariners for reliever Steve Cishek on July 28. Friday night the right-hander made his first appearance against the Rays since the trade, and he held the Rays scoreless for the first five innings before Kevin Kiermaier doubled in the sixth and scored on Lucas Duda's sacrifice fly to mint the Rays' first run.\n\nRamirez's final line showed one run on two hits and two walks with four strikeouts in six innings to earn his fifth win of the season.\n\nThe Mariners got busy early against Rays starter Austin Pruitt. Cruz doubled home one, and scored to highlight a three-run first. Mike Zunino doubled home two more in the fourth, and Ben Gamel singled home another in the fifth to build a 6-0 lead. Cruz finished off the Mariners' scoring with his 30th home run of the season, a 482-foot upper-deck shot off Brad Boxberger in the ninth.

(AP) -- The Seattle Mariners got early home runs from Mitch Haniger and Nelson Cruz and held on for a 7-6 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays on Saturday night, one that brightened their wild-card hopes another notch.\n\n\"I think every single game from here on out is going to be a huge game for us, so we're just looking to capitalize on every opportunity,\" said Haniger, who staked the Mariners to a 4-1 lead with a grand slam in the third inning.\n\nHaniger, who was hit in the face by a pitch on July 29, hit his first career grand slam in his first game back after a three-week stretch on the disabled list. It was his eighth homer of the season.\n\nCruz, who is on an 11-game hitting streak, hit his 31st homer and his seventh in 10 games, raising his league-leading RBI total to 100. It was measured at 371 feet, or 101 feet less than his homer on Friday night.\n\n\"They all count. It was just far enough,\" manager Scott Servais said. \"We are riding the broomstick right now, no doubt. Nellie is hot, swinging the bat great, and everybody else is contributing as well.\"\n\nThe Mariners' fourth straight win left them near the top of a pack of teams competing for a wild card berth with six weeks left in the season.\n\n\"Every team in the wild-card hunt right now has had its hot streaks and its cold streaks. We're no different than anybody else,\" Servais said. \"Hopefully we can ride this hot streak a little longer.\"\n\nBoth home runs came off Jake Odorizzi, who gave up seven runs and eight hits in 3 2/3 innings. Odorizzi (6-7) lost his third straight start.\n\nSteven Souza Jr. hit his 26th homer and Lucas Duda hit his fifth for the Rays, who lost for the eighth time in nine games. Logan Morrison added a pinch-hit homer in the ninth, his 29th of the season.\n\nThe six runs were the most by the Rays in a home game since June 23. They have scored only 30 runs in their last 15 games.\n\n\"The bats finally came to life. To me that's the story of the game,\" manager Kevin Cash said. \"We lost. It stinks, but we needed to see some type of production, some type of positive performance from the offense and I think we provided that right down to the very last out.\"\n\nAriel Miranda (8-6) won for the first time in nine starts since June 30, giving up three runs and five hits while striking out five in five innings.\n\nEdwin Diaz, the fifth Seattle reliever, pitched the ninth for his 27th save.\n\nCATWALK DOUBLE PLAY\n\nMariners catcher Mike Zunino hit into the first catwalk double play in the history of Tropicana Field. With Guillermo Heredia on first base in the seventh inning, Zunino hit a towering popup that changed direction as it caromed off a catwalk and dropped into left-center field. Rays shortstop Adeiny Hechevarria dived to catch it. Noticing nobody covering second base, Heredia tagged up and beat Hechavarria's throw to second, but slid over the bag and was tagged out.\n\nRAYS CLAIM PUELLO\n\nThe Rays claimed OF Cesar Puello off outright waivers from the Los Angeles Angels late Saturday and announced they will make a corresponding roster move. Puello, 26, has spent 10 minor league seasons in the Mets, Yankees, Rangers and Angels organizations.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMARINERS: OF Jarrod Dyson (strained right groin) was placed on the 10-day disabled list. Haniger replaced Dyson on the active roster after a 6-game rehab assignment.\n\nRAYS: RHP Matt Andriese, whose Friday night rehab start ended after two pitches when a ball was hit off his shin, will make at least two more rehab starts, according to Cash.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSeattle born and raised LHP Blake Snell (1-6) will pitch Sunday's season finale for the Rays after breaking a 16-start winless streak at Toronto on Tuesday. RHP Yovani Gallardo (5-8) will make his fifth career start at Tropicana Field, his first for the Mariners.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

With Guillermo Heredia on first base in the seventh inning, Zunino hit a towering popup that changed direction as it caromed off a catwalk and dropped into left-center field. Rays shortstop Adeiny Hechevarria dived to catch it. Noticing nobody covering second base, Heredia tagged up and beat Hechavarria's throw to second, but slid over the bag and was tagged out.\n\nRAYS CLAIM PUELLO\n\nThe Rays claimed OF Cesar Puello off outright waivers from the Los Angeles Angels late Saturday and announced they will make a corresponding roster move. Puello, 26, has spent 10 minor league seasons in the Mets, Yankees, Rangers and Angels organizations.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMARINERS: OF Jarrod Dyson (strained right groin) was placed on the 10-day disabled list. Haniger replaced Dyson on the active roster after a 6-game rehab assignment.\n\nRAYS: RHP Matt Andriese, whose Friday night rehab start ended after two pitches when a ball was hit off his shin, will make at least two more rehab starts, according to Cash.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSeattle born and raised LHP Blake Snell (1-6) will pitch Sunday's season finale for the Rays after breaking a 16-start winless streak at Toronto on Tuesday. RHP Yovani Gallardo (5-8) will make his fifth career start at Tropicana Field, his first for the Mariners.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T02:55:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 514, "textStart": 507,

PETERSBURG -- Kevin Kiermaier returned. The problem was, so did Erasmo Ramirez.\n\nKiermaier turned a hustle double into a run. Ramirez, with help from his bullpen, made sure that was the Rays' only run in the Mariners' 7-1 victory Friday in front of 11,501 at Tropicana Field.\n\nThe Rays (60-64) scratched out four hits -- three from Wilson Ramos -- in losing for the 11th time in their past 14 games. They are a season-worst four games under .500.\n\nSince climbing to a season-high seven games above .500 after a win in Oakland on July 18, they are 9-20.\n\nWhat's more, they have averaged 2.97 runs per game since the All-Star break.\n\nThe Rays, who began the day three games out of the second wild-card spot in the American League, missed a chance to gain ground in the standings, or at least gain ground on the Mariners, one of four teams sitting between them and that last wild-card spot.\n\nRELATED: Rays journal: Kevin Kiermaier returns, Mallex Smith sent to Triple A.\n\nRamirez, who was traded by the Rays last month, saw to that.\n\nSo did wasting a bases-loaded, one-out opportunity in the second inning when Adeiny Hechavarria and Daniel Robertson flied out.\n\nThe highlight of the night was Nelson Cruz's mammoth home run in the ninth inning off Brad Boxberger that was measured by MLB Statcast at 482 feet, making it the longest home run in Trop history.\n\n\"Cool,\" Cruz said. \"Do they give me a prize for that?\"\n\nThe good news: Rays rookie Austin Pruitt went seven innings. He allowed career highs in hits (11) and runs (six), but he saved the bullpen.\n\n\"Probably wasn't his sharpest, wasn't quite as crisp. Saying that, he still kept his pitch count really down and picked us up in a big way,\" manager Kevin Cash said. \"The bullpen could have gotten blown up right there, and we don't need that to happen on top of everything else that's not going on.\"\n\nRELATED: Roger Mooney's takeaways from Friday's Rays-Mariners game.\n\nThat the Seattle hitters were aggressive helped Pruitt, who threw 33 pitches while allowing three first-inning runs but followed with a nine-pitch second inning and a seven-pitch third.\n\n\"At that point (after the first inning), I'm thinking, 'All right, let's get through five here.' They were very aggressive, swung at the first pitch and allowed me to go deeper,\" Pruitt said.\n\nKiermaier missed 61 games with a right hip fracture and a lower back strain suffered during his first minor-league rehab stint with Class A Charlotte. He said before the game he hoped to inject some much-needed energy into the fading Rays.\n\n\"I don't think you can say one guy coming back and everything is going to turn,\" Cash said before the game. \"If it works out that way, I'll stand corrected.\"\n\nThe night was also a homecoming for Ramirez, who made his first appearance at the Trop since being traded July 28 to Seattle for reliever Steve Cishek.\n\nEarlier this season, pitching coach Jim Hickey called Ramirez the MVP of the Rays' pitching staff for his ability to fill any role -- starter, long relief, late relief. On Friday, he reminded the Rays that he could turn in a decent start, too.\n\n\"What can I say. This feels weird because it's been no more than a month (since the trade),\" Ramirez said. \"But in my mind, no matter where you go, you just have to execute every pitch. We're in the fight for the playoffs, so I cannot just come here and give up.\n\n\"I know I have a lot of friends on the other side, but at the same time, it's a game and I have to play for my team in this moment. Everything was working; the pitches were down at the right moment. I got out of the bases loaded. That gave me extra energy.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T21:56:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 540, "textStart": 533, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-18", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 2821, "textStart": 2814, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-28", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.6901960968971252, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373109", "time": "21:56:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373109", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "302624", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)", "score": 4}, {"id": "303564", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "score": 2}, {"id": "303571", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "score": 2}, {"id": "303573", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "score": 3}, {"id": "303714", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "score": 2}, {"id": "305020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Innings"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "score": 5}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 4}, {"id": "305865", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "score": 5}, {"id": "310508", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "score": 5}, {"id": "310669", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "American League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "score": 3}, {"id": "312236", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "score": 3}, {"id": "322748", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "score": 5}, {"id": "337164", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tropicana Field"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropicana_Field", "score": 3}, {"id": "374972", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Wilson Ramos"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Ramos", "score": 3}, {"id": "379140", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brad Boxberger"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Boxberger", "score": 3}, {"id": "393365", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kevin Cash"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Cash", "score": 2}, {"id": "399851", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pitch count"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_count", "score": 2}, {"id": "401539", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Steve Cishek"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cishek", "score": 2}, {"id": "411926", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Nelson Cruz"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Cruz", "score": 3}, {"id": "440954", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Adeiny Hechavarria"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adeiny_Hechavarria", "score": 3}, {"id": "1299271", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Kevin Kiermaier"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Kiermaier", "score": 5}, {"id": "1317476", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mallex Smith"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallex_Smith", "score": 3}], "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20170818/ARTICLE/308189465/EP/1/30/EP-308189465.jpg", "timeCrawl": "21:56:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Longest home run at Trop and Erasmo Ramirez's pitching doom Rays (w/video)", "originalArticle": null}

WATCH IT LIVE ON FOX SPORTS GO\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Rays manager Kevin Cash cannot point to anything different in his team's hitting approach, but the results have been crushing, with a single run again in Friday's 7-1 loss to the Seattle Mariners, Tampa Bay's 11th loss in 14 games.\n\n\"We're just missing pitches that we should hit,\" Cash said after his team had only four hits, continuing a slump from their last home stand that now includes nine runs scored in their last 10 home games.\n\nWatch the Tampa Bay Rays on FOX Sports Sun Broadcast scheduleFOX Sports GoVIDEO: Rays news, interviews & featuresVIDEO: Rays baseball demonstrations\n\nAs the Rays continue a three-game series against Seattle on Saturday, they'll again count on strong solid pitching from righty Jake Odorizzi. The Rays have one of the best staff ERAs in baseball in August, but little to show for it in the standings.\n\n\"You wouldn't accept playing .500 baseball. We've made that very clear,\" Cash said of his team's pitching success going for naught. \"Pitching has been outstanding for us. We're right there at the tops in baseball from the All-Star break. You would not accept playing .500 baseball, and we're not even close. ... That's where the frustration kicks in. We're spoiling some tremendous outings from our pitchers.\"\n\nOdorizzi had a quality start in his last outing -- six innings, three hits and two runs, but took the loss against Toronto. For the season, he's 6-6 with a 4.30 ERA, though he's fared better in his career against Seattle, going 1-2 with a 3.20 ERA in five career starts. His last outing wasn't so good -- only 2 1/3 innings, his shortest non-injury start in five years, giving up five unearned runs against Seattle in June.\n\nThe Mariners -- with much hotter bats on their sides, coming off back-to-back seven-run wins -- will counter with left-hander Ariel Miranda, who is 7-6 with a 4.75 ERA. He's making his second career start against the Rays -- on June 4, he threw a complete-game four-hitter against Tampa Bay, striking out nine while walking only one.\n\nSeattle's bats are at the opposite end of the spectrum, producing enough offense to make a quality start unnecessary. Nelson Cruz alone had a 482-foot home run and two doubles in Friday's win -- his eight total bases were more than the six the Rays totaled in the entire game.\n\nSeattle is staying in close contention for a wild-card spot despite hovering close to .500, but the Rays are starting to fall short of that, falling with Friday's loss to four games under .500 for the first time this season.\n\nEven in opening a daunting 12-game road trip, their longest since 2010, the Mariners have momentum in their favor and will need it over the next two weeks.\n\n\"Everybody's chipping in and that's what it's going to take on this road trip,\" manager Scott Servais said after Friday's win. \"We're off to a great start, and that's what we needed tonight.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T14:03:00Z",

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Mitch Haniger hit a grand slam, Nelson Cruz added his 31st home run and the Seattle Mariners rolled to their fourth straight win Saturday night, a 7-6 decision over the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nHaniger's first career grand slam came in his first game back after a three-week stretch on the disabled list, lifting the Mariners to a 4-1 lead in the third inning. It was his eighth homer of the season.\n\nHaniger was hit in the face by a pitch on July 29.\n\nCruz, who is on an 11-game hitting streak, hit his seventh homer in 10 games with a man on base in the fourth, raising his league-leading RBI total to 100.\n\nBoth home runs came off Jake Odorizzi, who gave up seven runs and eight hits in 3 2/3 innings. Odorizzi (6-7) lost his third straight start.\n\nSteven Souza Jr. hit his 26th homer and Lucas Duda hit his fifth for the Rays, who lost for the eighth time in nine games. Logan Morrison added a pinch-hit homer in the ninth, his 29th of the season.\n\nAriel Miranda (8-6) won for the first time in nine starts since June 30, giving up three runs and five hits while striking out five in five innings.\n\nEdwin Diaz, the fifth Seattle reliever, pitched the ninth for his 27th save.\n\nCATWALK DOUBLE PLAY\n\nMariners catcher Mike Zunino hit into the first catwalk double play in the history of Tropicana Field. With Guillermo Heredia on first base in the seventh inning, Zunino hit a towering popup that changed direction as it caromed off a catwalk and dropped into left-centre field. Rays shortstop Adeiny Hechevarria dived to catch it. Noticing nobody covering second base, Heredia tagged up and beat Hechavarria's throw to second, but slid over the bag and was tagged out.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMARINERS: OF Jarrod Dyson (strained right groin) was placed on the 10-day disabled list. Haniger replaced Dyson on the active roster after a 6-game rehab assignment.\n\nRAYS: RHP Matt Andriese, whose Friday night rehab start ended after two pitches when a ball was hit off his shin, will make at least two more rehab starts, according to manager Kevin Cash.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSeattle born and raised LHP Blake Snell (1-6) will pitch Sunday's season finale for the Rays after breaking a 16-start winless streak at Toronto on Tuesday. RHP Yovani Gallardo (5-8) will make his fifth career start at Tropicana Field, his first for the Mariners.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T01:56:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 466, "textStart": 459,

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- He had to stand and wait out a replay delay of just under two minutes to verify that the final out of his outing was official.\n\nBut when Erasmo Ramirez was finally able to walk off the mound at Tropicana Field following six innings of solid pitching, he did something that hasn't happened enough for the Mariners this season -- deliver a quality outing of more than five innings.\n\nFacing the team that he started the season with, Ramirez allowed just one run on two hits over six innings to lead the Mariners to a 7-1 win over the Rays on Friday night.\n\nSeattle moved back over .500 at 62-61 with a 20-9 record in its last 29 games away from Safeco Field. The Mariners have 11 more games in 12 days on the road trip.\n\nRamirez's start was just the 56th time in 123 games that a Mariners' starting pitcher delivered six complete innings of work in an outing. It was just the 25th time that a Mariners starter had pitched at least six complete innings while allowing one run or less.\n\nRamirez was the last starter to do both, pitching six innings and allowing one run on three hits against the Angels. It was a game the Mariners would lose thanks to a bullpen meltdown from Casey Lawrence and Tony Zych.\n\nBut on this occasion, the Mariners had provided more than enough run support to allow a rested bullpen to work without trepidation. Seattle banged out 14 hits and improved to 57-19 in games where it scores four or more runs.\n\nJames Pazos gave the Mariners 21/3 innings of shutout relief work while Emilio Pagan notched the final two outs.\n\nSeattle jumped on Tampa starter Austin Pruitt, scoring three runs in the first inning. Nelson Cruz hammered an RBI double to center, and Kyle Seager and Danny Valencia each drove in runs.\n\nMike Zunino tacked on two more runs in the fourth inning with a display his freakish strength. No, he didn't hit one of towering homers that seem to stay up in the air forever.\n\nWith runners on second and third and one out, Zunino got behind in the count 1-2. Not wanting to strike out, he made a lunging swing on a breaking ball that spun low and away out of the strike zone. He was able to get the barrel to the ball and make decent contact. For most hitters, it might be a fly ball to right or even a soft liner. Zunino's swing produced a ball that hit off the wall in deep right center.\n\nSeattle added another run in the fifth on an RBI single from Ben Gamel, who had two hits, to make it 7-1.\n\nBut the most memorable run of the night came in the top of the ninth. Facing right-hander Brad Boxberger, Cruz crushed a 0-1 fastball deep into the upper deck in left field. For about the fifth time in the MLB Statcast era, Cruz hit a ball so far and hard that it didn't register in the parameters of the advanced measuring system.\n\nMLB later issued a distance on the homer that credited Statcast with measuring it at 482 feet, which would make it the longest homer in Tropicana Field history.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T02:17:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim":

That was June 4 at Safeco Field when he held the Rays to four hits in a 7-1 victory.\n\nMiranda (7-6 with a 4.75 ERA) will face the Rays again at 3:10 p.m. Saturday at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Fla., and, just maybe, that can pull him out of an extended funk.\n\nIt's been a rough two-plus months for Miranda since that complete game: 1-4 with a 5.74 ERA in 12 starts. He is winless in his last seven starts -- and for one big reason: Home runs.\n\nMiranda has allowed 30 home runs, which puts him one behind the Angels right-hander Ricky Nolasco, who leads (trails?) the majors with 31.\n\n\"It's just part of the game,\" Miranda said. \"If you're going to pitch, you're going to give up homers.

You've got to limit those.\"\n\nManager Scott Servais offered a deeper explanation.\n\n\"He lives at the top of the strike zone because of his ball has some life on it,\" Servais said. \"When it doesn't have as much life and it's not all the way at the top of the zone, when it's in that middle range, it gets hit.\n\n\"And it typically goes in the air...We've got to find a way to get him back on the right track because it has been rough.\"\n\nThe ball could be flying Saturday at The Trop because Tampa Bay starter Jake Odorizzi (6-6, 4.30) is allowing homers at an even higher rate than Miranda: an MLB-leading 2.06 per nine innings (and 24 overall).\n\n***The Mariners are 62-61 after Friday's 7-1 victory over the Rays in the series opener. They are tied with Kansas City at one-half game behind Los Angeles and Minnesota in the race for the American League's final wild-card berth.\n\n***Odorizzi gave up eight runs in 2 1/3 innings June 2 when the Mariners rolled to a 12-4 victory at Safeco Field. An error by Rays second baseman Brad Miller led to five unearned runs in the first inning.\n\n***Nelson Cruz leads the American League with 98 RBIs and needs two to reach triple figures for the third time in four years. He is just 10 shy of his career high of 108, set in 2014 in Baltimore.\n\n***Odorizzi is 1-2 with a 3.20 ERA in five career starts against the Mariners.\n\n***Robinson Cano had a single in Friday's victory for his 205th career hit against the Rays. Only three other players have reached 200 and all are retired: Derek Jeter (317), Alex Rodriguez (245) and David Ortiz (234).\n\n***The Mariners are 4-0 this season against the Rays and have won 15 of the last 20 games between the clubs.\n\n***When Erasmo Ramirez got the victory in Friday's series opener, he became the 21st different Mariners pitcher to record a victory this season. That matches a franchise record set a year ago.\n\n***The Rays have lost 11 of their last 14 games while being outscored 50-24. They scored three or fewer runs in 12 of those 14 games.\n\n***The Mariners are 42-35 in their history at Tropicana Field. It is the only road venue in the American League where they have a winning record.\n\nTIME CAPSULE\n\nIt was 16 years ago Saturday -- Aug. 19, 2001 -- that Mike Cameron set a career high and tied a franchise record by getting eight RBIs in a 10-2 victory over the Yankees in New York.\n\nCameron went 4-for-4 with two homers, a three-run drive in first inning against Andy Pettitte and a grand slam in the seventh inning against Jay Witasick. Cameron also had an RBI single in the fifth inning.\n\nAlvin Davis set the franchise record with eight RBIs in 1986 against Toronto, and Mike Blowers matched it in 1995 against Boston. Cameron is the only other Mariner to do it.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T18:42:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 116, "textStart": 110, "date": "-06-04", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 1766, "textStart":

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Rays manager Kevin Cash cannot point to anything different in his team's hitting approach, but the results have been crushing, with a single run again in Friday's 7-1 loss to the Seattle Mariners, Tampa Bay's 11th loss in 14 games.\n\n\"We're just missing pitches that we should hit,\" Cash said after his team had only four hits, continuing a slump from their last home stand that now includes nine runs scored in their last 10 home games.\n\nAs the Rays continue a three-game series against Seattle on Saturday, they'll again count on strong solid pitching from righty Jake Odorizzi. The Rays have one of the best staff ERAs in baseball in August, but little to show for it in the standings.\n\n\"You wouldn't accept playing .500 baseball. We've made that very clear,\" Cash said of his team's pitching success going for naught. \"Pitching has been outstanding for us. We're right there at the tops in baseball from the All-Star break. You would not accept playing .500 baseball, and we're not even close. ... That's where the frustration kicks in. We're spoiling some tremendous outings from our pitchers.\"\n\nOdorizzi had a quality start in his last outing -- six innings, three hits and two runs, but took the loss against Toronto. For the season, he's 6-6 with a 4.30 ERA, though he's fared better in his career against Seattle, going 1-2 with a 3.20 ERA in five career starts. His last outing wasn't so good -- only 2 1/3 innings, his shortest non-injury start in five years, giving up five unearned runs against Seattle in June.\n\nThe Mariners -- with much hotter bats on their sides, coming off back-to-back seven-run wins -- will counter with left-hander Ariel Miranda, who is 7-6 with a 4.75 ERA. He's making his second career start against the Rays -- on June 4, he threw a complete-game four-hitter against Tampa Bay, striking out nine while walking only one.\n\nSeattle's bats are at the opposite end of the spectrum, producing enough offense to make a quality start unnecessary. Nelson Cruz alone had a 482-foot home run and two doubles in Friday's win -- his eight total bases were more than the six the Rays totaled in the entire game.\n\nSeattle is staying in close contention for a wild-card spot despite hovering close to .500, but the Rays are starting to fall short of that, falling with Friday's loss to four games under .500 for the first time this season.\n\nEven in opening a daunting 12-game road trip, their longest since 2010, the Mariners have momentum in their favor and will need it over the next two weeks.\n\n\"Everybody's chipping in and that's what it's going to take on this road trip,\" manager Scott Servais said after Friday's win. \"We're off to a great start, and that's what we needed tonight.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T08:36:00Z",

PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) Mitch Haniger hit a grand slam, Nelson Cruz added his 31st home run and the Seattle Mariners rolled to their fourth straight win Saturday night, a 7-6 decision over the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nHaniger's first career grand slam came in his first game back after a three-week stretch on the disabled list, lifting the Mariners to a 4-1 lead in the third inning. It was his eighth homer of the season.\n\nHaniger was hit in the face by a pitch on July 29.\n\nCruz, who is on an 11-game hitting streak, hit his seventh homer in 10 games with a man on base in the fourth, raising his league-leading RBI total to 100.\n\nBoth home runs came off Jake Odorizzi, who gave up seven runs and eight hits in 3 2/3 innings. Odorizzi (6-7) lost his third straight start.\n\nSteven Souza Jr. hit his 26th homer and Lucas Duda hit his fifth for the Rays, who lost for the eighth time in nine games. Logan Morrison added a pinch-hit homer in the ninth, his 29th of the season.\n\nAriel Miranda (8-6) won for the first time in nine starts since June 30, giving up three runs and five hits while striking out five in five innings.\n\nEdwin Diaz, the fifth Seattle reliever, pitched the ninth for his 27th save.\n\nCATWALK DOUBLE PLAY\n\nMariners catcher Mike Zunino hit into the first catwalk double play in the history of Tropicana Field. With Guillermo Heredia on first base in the seventh inning, Zunino hit a towering popup that changed direction as it caromed off a catwalk and dropped into left-center field. Rays shortstop Adeiny Hechevarria dived to catch it. Noticing nobody covering second base, Heredia tagged up and beat Hechavarria's throw to second, but slid over the bag and was tagged out.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMARINERS: OF Jarrod Dyson (strained right groin) was placed on the 10-day disabled list. Haniger replaced Dyson on the active roster after a 6-game rehab assignment.\n\nRAYS: RHP Matt Andriese, whose Friday night rehab start ended after two pitches when a ball was hit off his shin, will make at least two more rehab starts, according to manager Kevin Cash.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSeattle born and raised LHP Blake Snell (1-6) will pitch Sunday's season finale for the Rays after breaking a 16-start winless streak at Toronto on Tuesday. RHP Yovani Gallardo (5-8) will make his fifth career start at Tropicana Field, his first for the Mariners.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T01:48:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 468, "textStart": 461,

Throw in a 482-foot homer by Nelson Cruz, the longest in Tropicana Field history, and, yep, a pretty good night.\n\n\"It's like I always say - it starts with the pitching,\" Cruz said. \"Erasmo and the bullpen did the job today. They gave up one run, and (the Mariners') offense scored seven. It looks pretty nice all around.\"\n\nRamirez (5-4) gave up one run and just two hits in six innings and gained his first victory in four starts since returning to the Mariners from Tampa Bay in a July 28 trade for veteran reliever Steve Cishek.\n\n\"That's what we needed to get tonight,\" manager Scott Servais said. \"A deep start by our starter and to put some runs up there.\"\n\nThe Mariners whacked Rays starter Aaron Pruitt (6-4) for three runs and four hits in the first inning. Cruz contributed a run-scoring double that also extended his hitting streak to 10 games. He was just getting started.\n\nMike Zunino's two-run double in the fourth inning extended the lead to 5-0.\n\nRamirez deserved a victory in his last start when he held the Los Angeles Angels to one unearned run in six innings before the bullpen blew a four-run lead in a 6-5 loss.\n\nNot this time.\n\nJames Pazos and Emilio Pagan combined for three scoreless innings.\n\nThe victory pulled the Mariners back over .500 at 62-61 and to within one-half game of the Angels in the race for the American League's final wild-card berth. The Angels suffered a walk-off loss at Baltimore.\n\nCruz's boomer came with two outs in the ninth inning against reliever Brad Boxberger. It was a soaring drive to left field that sailed into the upper deck.\n\n\"He's special,\" third baseman Kyle Seager said, \"but even special guys don't hit it that far. That's a different level.\"\n\nCruz's response: \"They give you any prize for that?\"\n\nRoad warrior: Pazos replaced Ramirez to start the seventh and worked 2 1/3 scoreless innings with five strikeouts before Pagan got the final two outs.\n\nPazos is on a nice run in August after a shaky stretch that saw him allow 14 runs in eight innings. Since the calendar turned, he has not allowed an earned run over 6 2/3 innings in six outings.\n\nHe's been strong all year on the road: a 1.14 ERA in 22 outings in contrast to a 6.04 ERA in 25 appearances at Safeco Field.\n\nStaying alert: The Rays scored their only run after Kevin Kiermaier took advantage of an atypically casual play by center fielder Guillermo Heredia after a leadoff single in the sixth inning.\n\nKiermaier kept running and turned a single into a hustle double. He moved to third on a grounder and scored on a one-out sacrifice fly by Lucas Duda to short center field.\n\nHeredia had a play on Kiermaier at the plate by threw high and wide.\n\n500 club: Seager returned to the lineup after missing two games because of a stomach virus and marked the occasion by joining the 500-RBI club. It came on a ground out in a three-run first inning.\n\n\"That's pretty good,\" he said. \"It's something I'm proud of.\"\n\nSeager is the 10th player to drive in 500 runs as a Mariner.\n\nThe others are Edgar Martinez (1,261), Ken Griffey Jr. (1,216), Jay Buhner (951), Alvin Davis (667), Ichiro Suzuki (633), Raul Ibanez (612), Alex Rodriguez (595), Brett Boone (535) and Dan Wilson (508).",

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Rays manager Kevin Cash cannot point to anything different in his team's hitting approach, but the results have been crushing, with a single run again in Friday's 7-1 loss to the Seattle Mariners, Tampa Bay's 11th loss in 14 games.\n\n\"We're just missing pitches that we should hit,\" Cash said after his team had only four hits, continuing a slump from their last home stand that now includes nine runs scored in their last 10 home games.\n\nAs the Rays continue a three-game series against Seattle on Saturday, they'll again count on strong solid pitching from righty Jake Odorizzi. The Rays have one of the best staff ERAs in baseball in August, but little to show for it in the standings.\n\n\"You wouldn't accept playing .500 baseball. We've made that very clear,\" Cash said of his team's pitching success going for naught. \"Pitching has been outstanding for us. We're right there at the tops in baseball from the All-Star break. You would not accept playing .500 baseball, and we're not even close. ... That's where the frustration kicks in. We're spoiling some tremendous outings from our pitchers.\"\n\nOdorizzi had a quality start in his last outing -- six innings, three hits and two runs, but took the loss against Toronto. For the season, he's 6-6 with a 4.30 ERA, though he's fared better in his career against Seattle, going 1-2 with a 3.20 ERA in five career starts. His last outing wasn't so good -- only 2 1/3 innings, his shortest non-injury start in five years, giving up five unearned runs against Seattle in June.\n\nThe Mariners -- with much hotter bats on their sides, coming off back-to-back seven-run wins -- will counter with left-hander Ariel Miranda, who is 7-6 with a 4.75 ERA. He's making his second career start against the Rays -- on June 4, he threw a complete-game four-hitter against Tampa Bay, striking out nine while walking only one.\n\nSeattle's bats are at the opposite end of the spectrum, producing enough offense to make a quality start unnecessary. Nelson Cruz alone had a 482-foot home run and two doubles in Friday's win -- his eight total bases were more than the six the Rays totaled in the entire game.\n\nSeattle is staying in close contention for a wild-card spot despite hovering close to .500, but the Rays are starting to fall short of that, falling with Friday's loss to four games under .500 for the first time this season.\n\nEven in opening a daunting 12-game road trip, their longest since 2010, the Mariners have momentum in their favor and will need it over the next two weeks.\n\n\"Everybody's chipping in and that's what it's going to take on this road trip,\" manager Scott Servais said after Friday's win. \"We're off to a great start, and that's what we needed tonight.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T08:20:00Z",

Meanwhile, the Rays (60-65) lost their fourth straight. Since winning three straight at Houston, the Rays have won just three times in their last 15 games.\n\nHaniger gave the Mariners an early three-run lead with a grand slam in the third off Rays starter Jake Odorizzi. In the fourth, Cruz added his 31st home run of the season with a man aboard to put the Mariners up, 7-2.\n\nMiranda allowed three runs on five hits in five innings to move to 8-6 on the season. Odorizzi fell to 6-7 after allowing seven runs on eight hits and five walks in 3 2/3 innings.\n\nMOMENTS THAT MATTERED\n\nHaniger's slam: The Rays held a 1-0 lead when Haniger stepped to the plate in the third with the bases loaded. Odorizzi fell behind 1-0 before trying an 87-mph cutter. Haniger connected, depositing the baseball into the left-field stands for his eighth home run of the season and his first career grand slam. The 377-foot home run had a 99.2-mph exit velocity with a 36-degree launch angle, according to Statcast\u2122, and it gave the Mariners a 4-1 lead.\n\nCruzin': Friday night, Cruz hit the longest home run in Tropicana Field history when he connected in the ninth for a 482-foot homer. Saturday night, Cruz again went deep, but this time it wasn't as obvious. His two-run shot in the fourth had to be reviewed before he was awarded his 31st home run of the season. No matter the distance, home runs count the same, and Cruz's gave the Mariners a 7-2 lead.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T01:56:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6117647290229797, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {"gpCnt": 3}, "storyUri": "eng-3373109", "time": "01:56:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373109", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "302624", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)", "score": 4}, {"id": "303711", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "score": 2}, {"id": "305018", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "score": 3}, {"id": "305021", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "score": 4}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 4}, {"id": "310508", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "score": 5}, {"id": "310589", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of baseball (S)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_(S)", "score": 1}, {"id": "322748", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "score": 5}, {"id": "328427", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "337164", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tropicana Field"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropicana_Field", "score": 2}, {"id": "420250", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jake Odorizzi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Odorizzi", "score": 3}, {"id": "548622", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball wild card"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_wild_card", "score": 3}], "image": "http://m.mlb.com/assets/images/9/7/0/249451970/cuts/1280x720/cut.jpg", "timeCrawl": "01:56:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Mariners beat Rays on Mitch Haniger grand slam", "originalArticle": null}

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Mitch Haniger hit a grand slam, Nelson Cruz added his 31st home run and the Seattle Mariners rolled to their fourth straight win Saturday night, a 7-6 decision over the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nHaniger's first career grand slam came in his first game back after a three-week stretch on the disabled list, lifting the Mariners to a 4-1 lead in the third inning. It was his eighth homer of the season.\n\nHaniger was hit in the face by a pitch on July 29.\n\nCruz, who is on an 11-game hitting streak, hit his seventh homer in 10 games with a man on base in the fourth, raising his league-leading RBI total to 100.\n\nBoth home runs came off Jake Odorizzi, who gave up seven runs and eight hits in 3 2/3 innings. Odorizzi (6-7) lost his third straight start.\n\nSteven Souza Jr. hit his 26th homer and Lucas Duda hit his fifth for the Rays, who lost for the eighth time in nine games. Logan Morrison added a pinch-hit homer in the ninth, his 29th of the season.\n\nAriel Miranda (8-6) won for the first time in nine starts since June 30, giving up three runs and five hits while striking out five in five innings.\n\nEdwin Diaz, the fifth Seattle reliever, pitched the ninth for his 27th save.\n\nCATWALK DOUBLE PLAY\n\nMariners catcher Mike Zunino hit into the first catwalk double play in the history of Tropicana Field. With Guillermo Heredia on first base in the seventh inning, Zunino hit a towering popup that changed direction as it caromed off a catwalk and dropped into left-center field. Rays shortstop Adeiny Hechevarria dived to catch it. Noticing nobody covering second base, Heredia tagged up and beat Hechavarria's throw to second, but slid over the bag and was tagged out.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMARINERS: OF Jarrod Dyson (strained right groin) was placed on the 10-day disabled list. Haniger replaced Dyson on the active roster after a 6-game rehab assignment.\n\nRAYS: RHP Matt Andriese, whose Friday night rehab start ended after two pitches when a ball was hit off his shin, will make at least two more rehab starts, according to manager Kevin Cash.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSeattle born and raised LHP Blake Snell (1-6) will pitch Sunday's season finale for the Rays after breaking a 16-start winless streak at Toronto on Tuesday. RHP Yovani Gallardo (5-8) will make his fifth career start at Tropicana Field, his first for the Mariners.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T01:46:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 466, "textStart": 459,

The M's pounded on the Rays to win the opening game of their 12-game road trip, getting six solid innings from Erasmo Ramirez in a 7-1 win on Friday. The win, combined with the Angels walk-off loss, put them a half game back of Los Angeles in the wild card race, tied with the Royals.\n\n[ Using our mobile app? Switch to browser \" ]\n\nSeattle starts left-hander Ariel Miranda (7-6, 4.75 ERA), who has struggled mightily his last 11 starts, going 1-4 with a 6.03 ERA dating back to June 15. He's allowed eight home runs over his last four starts, tying him with Mike Fiers for the second-most homers allowed this season (30), trailing only Ricky Nolasco (31).

PETERSBURG -- RHP Jake Odorizzi turned in another short outing Saturday, failing to pitch four innings during the Rays' 7-6 loss.\n\nOdorizzi allowed seven runs on eight hits, walked five and struck out two in 32/3 innings. The big blow was a grand slam by RF Mitch Haniger in the third inning. He also allowed a two-run homer to DH Nelson Cruz in the fourth.\n\nIt was the fourth time in his last seven starts that Odorizzi failed to pitch five innings.\n\nOdorizzi (6-7, 4.74) has allowed home runs in all but two of his 21 starts this season. He's allowed multiple home runs in six of his last 12 start.\n\nA right-handed bat\n\nThe Rays claimed OF Cesar Puello, 26, off waivers from the Angels. The career minor-leaguer made his major-league debut this month, playing one game with the Angels. He split the season at Triple A between the Rangers and Angels, hitting a combined .327 with 13 home runs, 61 RBI and a .903 on-base plus slugging percentage. Puello is out of options. The Rays did not announce how he will fit into the 25-man roster.\n\nA Trop first\n\nSS Adeiny Hechavarria stayed with the high fly that the Mariners' Mike Zunino hit off the B-ring catwalk during the seventh. Since balls off that catwalk, he second from the roof, are in play, Zunino was out and Hechavarria caught the ball before it landed. Guillermo Heredia tagged up at first, and was out at second after coming off the bag. It was the first time in the stadium's history a ball off the B-ring was turned into a double play.\n\nGreen light for Cobb\n\nRHP Alex Cobb (turf toe) was given the all-clear Saturday after throwing an extended bullpen and pitching two innings of a simulated game. He expects to rejoin the rotation during the upcoming series against the Blue Jays.\"I think we got the green light to go full speed and pick up hopefully where we left off where pitch counts and anything like that will be irrelevant,\" Cobb said.\n\nBatting third and wearing No. 3 ...\n\nIs once again 3B Evan Longoria. After batting second for two games, Longoria was moved to his familiar No. 3 spot Saturday.\"I tried that for two days and it didn't work,\" manager Kevin Cash said. \"Or it didn't work the way we wanted it to. It didn't get immediate results. There's comfort for Longo hitting third. I like having him hit third. That's where he'll hit.\" As for the top of the order, Cash said he will stick with CF Kevin Kiermaier.\"The future, as it is right now, I see KK getting a lot of leadoff at-bats,\" Cash said.\n\nVisitors of the day\n\nIn an effort to keep things loose during a 12-game, four-city road trip that begin Friday, Mariners manager Scott Servais has a surprised planned for his team during each series.On Saturday, the Mariners were visited by a python, a baby alligator, a snapping turtle and an iguana.\n\nMiscellany\n\n* RHP Matt Andriese (hip) said his left leg was a little sore Saturday after he was struck just above the ankle during a minor-league rehab start at Class A Charlotte. He played catch and is scheduled for a bullpen today.\n\n* 3B Cristian Pedroza of the GCL Rays and C Chris Betts, who is in Class A Hudson Valley DL, traveled to the Trop on Saturday to hit against Cobb during his simulated game.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T02:47:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5215686559677124, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373109", "time":

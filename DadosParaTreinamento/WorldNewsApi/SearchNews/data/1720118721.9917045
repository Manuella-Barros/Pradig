{"id": 227490654, "title": "The work of \u2018Uncle Kiu\u2019, a former Post chief photographer, goes on show at special exhibition in Hong Kong News-Expo", "text": "A Hong Kong exhibition to honour the work of photojournalist and former Post chief photographer Chan Kiu has opened and brought some of his most striking images back into the public eye. Chan, who died in April aged 96, covered some of the biggest events in the city\u2019s history, including riots, an influx of refugees, typhoons, and disasters on land and at sea. The exhibition, at the Hong Kong News-Expo in Central, is spread over two floors and also gives the stories behind Chan\u2019s classic photographs, adding historical context to the walk through of his illustrious career. Walter Cheung Shu-wai, a former deputy news editor at the Post turned public relations professional, said Chan was \u201cever a gentleman\u201d, despite the competitive nature of the job. \u201c[Chan] was the photographer I most respected, not just because of his photographic skills, but also his professionalism, dedication, and kindness towards people around him, even photographers at other newspapers,\u201d he said. \u201cEver a gentleman, he worked with drive, vigour but managed to keep cool in the face of frustration. I can\u2019t recall seeing him lose his temper. \u201cHe was willing to teach greenhorns, including myself. No condescending attitude, but very encouraging. \u201cIt was a joy to go out with him on assignments. He was eager to impart his knowledge and share his experience with others.\u201d Among the work on display at the exhibition is one of Chan\u2019s most-remembered and award-winning pictures, taken during the floods of 1966, of a woman falling into the water in Sai Ying Pun. But the image gives no hint of the patience behind the picture \u2013 Chan stood knee-deep in the floodwater for almost an hour waiting for it to happen. Chan, known in Hong Kong media circles as \u201cUncle Kiu\u201d, won the nickname in tribute to the way he selflessly imparted his knowledge to younger photographers and because of his long and distinguished career in the industry. He died in early April in Vancouver, Canada, where he had lived with his family since 1993. Chan, born in 1927 to a working class family, started his career in 1956 at the then Hong Kong Tiger Standard as a darkroom assistant. He joined the Post three years later as a photographer and spent the rest of his working life at the newspaper until he retired in 1987. Legend has it that he shot about 40,000 rolls of film over his near-30 years at the Post. Only English language newspapers hired specialised news photographers when Chan entered the media. Reporters on Chinese language newspapers were expected to take pictures themselves, mainly for budget reasons. Chan won more than 30 awards in Hong Kong and internationally. He was awarded the Badge of Honour by Queen Elizabeth for his service and contribution to the city\u2019s media industry in 1985, the first city photographer to gain the distinction. The Hong Kong News-Expo staged a special session on Saturday to celebrate the opening of the exhibition, where media veterans talked about their memories of Chan. Tam Sik-yeung, a former assistant director of the government\u2019s Information Services Department, said Chan was a \u201ctrue gentleman\u201d, who always wore a smile. Garman Chan Ka-yiu, a former editor at the Post, echoed Tam\u2019s views. \u201cI have never heard anyone say bad things about Uncle Kiu, not even his competitors or rivals,\u201d he said. The exhibition \u2013 \u201cIn Memory of a Master Photojournalist, History of Hong Kong Through the Lens of Chan Kiu\u201d \u2013 is open every day except Monday from 10am to 7pm and admission is free. The Hong Kong News-Expo, opened in 2018, is dedicated to the history and significance of the news media in the city. It is housed in the listed former Bridges Street Market at 2 Bridges Street in Central.", "summary": "Exhibition to honour ex-Post chief photographer Chan Kiu, who covered some of the biggest events in Hong Kong history, including floods, an influx of refugees, typhoons and other disasters, opens.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3265086/work-uncle-kiu-former-post-chief-photographer-goes-show-special-exhibition-hong-kong-news-expo", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/02/5b6bfa60-5a66-4599-9021-1b2478c9e06e_2114ebfd.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:29:27", "author": "Ng Kang-chung", "authors": ["Ng Kang-chung"], "language": "en", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": 0.436}

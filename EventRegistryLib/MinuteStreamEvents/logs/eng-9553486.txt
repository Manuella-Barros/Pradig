Estonia's MFA had likewise been in close communication with the Iranian Embassy in Helsinki as well as summoned Iran's charg\u00e9 d'affaires in connection with the seizure of the ship.\n\nThe Estonian ministry noted that Portugal contributed significantly to the release of crew members aboard the Portugal-flagged ship as well, which is why the Estonian Embassy in Lisbon communicated closely with the Portuguese Foreign Ministry as well.\n\nShip seized with crew of 25 aboard\n\nOn Saturday, April 13, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), Iran's official state news agency reported that the Special Naval Force of the IRGC had seized the MCS Aries, an Israel-linked container ship, near the Strait of Hormuz.\n\n\"Members of the force carried out a heliborne operation on the ship's deck, directing it toward Iran's territorial waters,\" the IRNA wrote. \"The Portuguese flagged vessel is operated by the Zodiac Maritime Shipping Company, which is partly owned by Israeli businessman Eyal Ofer.\"\n\nThe Italian-Swiss Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) confirmed the same day that there were 25 people aboard the container ship that had been seized in the Persian Gulf, acknowledging that at approximately 2:43 a.m. UTC, Iranian forces came aboard the vessel by helicopter.\n\n\"She has 25 crew on board, and we are working closely with the relevant authorities to ensure their wellbeing and [the] safe return of the vessel,\" MSC said.\n\nOn April 14, Tsahkna announced that the MFA had received confirmation that among the crew aboard the MSC Aries is an Estonian resident.\n\n\"We've contacted the individual's family, and together with our partners we're implementing measures at our disposal to ensure that Iranian authorities release the ship's crew, including the Estonian resident, so they can return home,\" the foreign minister added.\n\nRetaliation following Israel's embassy strike\n\nThe ship seizure came amid heightened expectation of an Iranian attack on Israel after Israel's deadly bombing of the consular annex of the Iranian Embassy in Damascus, Syria on April 1, the BBC reported, adding that Israel stated on April 13 that Iran would \"bear the consequences for choosing to escalate the situation any further.\"\n\nOvernight into April 14, Iran also launched hundreds of drones and missiles against Israel in what the BBC likewise described as a \"widely anticipated reprisal attack.\"\n\nThe IRGC said it had launched the attack \"in retaliation against the Zionist regime's repeated crimes, including the attack on the Iranian Embassy's consulate in Damascus.\"\n\nThe embassy attack had been preceded by likewise deadly suspected Israeli strikes on Damascus and Aleppo in March.\n\nAccording to an Israeli military spokesperson commenting at the time, launches on April 14 \"numbered more than 300,\" but 99 percent of them were intercepted in what was described by Israel as a \"very significant strategic success,\" the Associated Press reported.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden said that Sunday that U.S. forces helped Israel down \"nearly all\" of the drones and missiles, and pledged to convene allies to develop a unified response.", "source": {"uri": "news.err.ee", "dataType": "news", "title": "ERR"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Shipping_Company", "type":

Concerning their return, there are some technicalities and contractual obligations. Once they are done, it will decide their return,\" MEA spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal said in a weekly press briefing on April 25.\n\nThe Iranian Ambassador to India, Iraj Elahi, has also said that the Indian nationals, crew members of MSC Aries, are not detained and that they are free to go.\n\nIn the wake of the seizure of the container vessel, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar spoke to his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, bringing up the release of the 17 Indian crew members.\n\nResponding to the request of the Estonian side regarding the Portuguese ship seized in the territorial waters of Iran and the release of the crew, Amirabdollahian said, \"The ship, which turned off its radar in the territorial waters of Iran and endangered the security of navigation, is detained under judicial rules.\"\n\nAdditionally, during the telephone discussion between Iranian and Estonian officials, Iran stated that it \"has already released all the ship's crew members on humanitarian grounds, and if the ship's captain accompanies them, the crew, including the Estonians can return to their country.\"\n\nAmirabdollahian further underlined that compliance with maritime rules and regulations by all ships is necessary and unavoidable in order to maintain maritime safety, according to the statement.Tensions escalated between Iran and the West amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.

The industry is collaborating with technology and equipment providers to explore alternative solutions for managing stranded gases, says GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.\n\nGlobalData's thematic report, \"Gas Flaring,\" reveals that efforts to monetize stranded gases are ramping up, especially in countries, such as the US, the UK, and Norway. Despite the overall decline in global flaring volumes, the top gas-flaring nations continue to emit large quantities. Most of these countries have struggled to join the global trend of reduced flaring due to their economic reliance on oil exports and limited access to mitigation technologies. The report also reviews the involvement of industry leaders, such as, BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Saudi Aramco, Shell, and TotalEnergies, in curtailing gas flaring.\n\nRavindra Puranik, Oil and Gas Analyst at GlobalData, comments: \"Gas flaring activity has been long associated with crude oil production. As crude oil became the backbone of the world economy, gas flaring became more common. Eventually, people started recognizing the environmental ill effects and associated monetary losses caused by gas flaring. This resulted in global efforts to monitor and mitigate the gas flaring activity.\"\n\nThe World Bank leads the global effort to reduce gas flaring through regular emission monitoring and supports industry participants to curb this activity. Oil companies as well as several national governments are signatories to its Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. The collaborations among investors, governments, and oil companies have resulted in a downward trend of global gas flaring by volume.\n\nAlthough gas flaring prevents the direct release of methane into the atmosphere (venting), it still leads to the generation of carbon dioxide in significant volumes. Environmentally conscious investors are putting pressure on oil and gas companies to mitigate flaring and venting activities. One such investor is the World Bank, which is actively supporting emission reduction through its ongoing initiative.\n\nPuranik concludes: \"The Paris Agreement of 2015 has bolstered efforts to reduce global flaring. New regulations have been introduced in countries such as the US and some countries in the Middle East, which have helped reduce flaring volumes. Even when the oil demand bounced back in 2022 and the world economy began to gather pace, flaring volumes were relatively low compared to the pre-pandemic levels. This trend is expected to hold for the foreseeable future, through global cooperation.\"\n\nSource: GlobalData", "source": {"uri": "hellenicshippingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hellenic Shipping News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gas flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraction_of_petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extraction of petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_plc", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shell plc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TotalEnergies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TotalEnergies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Aramco", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Aramco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ExxonMobil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Methane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760888", "eventUri": "eng-9760888", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

Though this is a remarkable improvement, we must strive to meet our country's target of 100 per cent gas flare elimination by 2025 which is just one year away and six years away from global commitment of 2030,\" Orji said.\n\nNEITI said it recognised that Nigeria needed to position itself as the technology frontier to take full advantage of the opportunities that lie in the energy transition journey especially as relates to gas production, utilisation, gas flaring and carbon emission reduction.\n\nThe opportunities, it said, are in the areas of investments in technology and innovation that will ensure a 'Just Transition' to net zero emission by 2060.\n\nHaving identified natural gas as its transition fuel, Orji , who was represented by NEITI's Director (Technical), Dieter Bassey, stressed that with over 200 trillion cubic feet, Nigeria has the largest gas reserves in Africa and the 9th largest in the world.\n\nHe advocated that stringent measures should be put in place with a plan that has clear timelines for delivery of Nigeria's gas flare elimination programme.\n\nAlso speaking, the Executive Director, Spaces for Change (S4C), Victoria Ibezim-Ohaeri, said that in a world increasingly focused on sustainability, Nigeria stands at a critical juncture with its commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2060.\n\n\"The journey to a just transition is not one we undertake lightly. It demands the collective efforts of policymakers, industry leaders, academics, civil society, and community representatives -- all of whom are present here today.\n\n\"The stakes are high. Gas flaring has far-reaching socio-economic and environmental impacts, particularly on our host communities. It exacerbates global warming, leads to economic losses, and squanders potential power generation resources.\n\n\"However, it is within our power to change this narrative. By reducing gas flaring, we can significantly cut our carbon emissions, unlock economic value, and foster sustainable development that benefits all Nigerians,\" she stated\n\nIn his remarks, the Chairman of the Bayelsa State Traditional Rulers Council, and Ibemanaweri of Ekpetiama Kingdom, His Royal Majesty Bubawaye Dakolo Agada IV, stated that gas flaring still poses a significant threat to the lives of people of the Niger Delta. \"Most of us have not seen any sign of reduction in gas flaring so far,\" he said.\n\nAlso speaking , the Minister of State, Dr Adekunle Salako, stated that while a few international oil companies and other operators were heeding the call of government for reduction of flaring in gas-related activities, most international oil companies were misusing their sectors to cause harm.\n\n\"Our partners in the Nigerian oil and gas sector have a responsibility to lead from the front to support the future of Nigeria to end gas flaring,\" he stated.", "source":

He pointed out the tangible progress made under Nigeria's Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme, launched in 2016 to attract investment in gas capture technologies.\n\nSalako however, noted that despite advancements, Nigeria still faces formidable obstacles in achieving its gas flaring reduction targets by 2030.\n\nHe listed Infrastructure deficits, regulatory shortcomings, and technology gaps as factors that have continued to impede progress.\n\nThe Minister stressed the need for enhanced collaboration with international partners and increased investment in renewable energy solutions.\n\nHe said: \"Historically, gas flaring has been a common practice in the Nigerian oil and gas industry due to the absence of infrastructure. As a result, the gas has been continuously burned in oil fields leading to the release of harmful pollutants into the atmosphere.\n\nHe added that, \"Despite regulatory efforts, enforcement regulations have been challenging and many operators still flare gas due to insufficient penalties and the high cost of gas capture and utilisation technologies. Nigeria's policy on gas flaring has however evolved significantly over the years.\n\n\"As of today, Nigeria remains one of the top 10 countries in the world in terms of gas flaring volumes. The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), reported that approximately 324 billion cubic feet of gas was flared in 2023 translating to significant economic losses and environmental damages including damage to the health of the people. This volume, though, represents a slight decrease from previous years, figures derived from the National Gas Flare Tracker shows that Nigeria has flared 148.7 million static cubic feet of gas in the first six months of 2024 which is about seven percent above the same level above the for the same period in 2023.\n\n\"So I agree with his Royal Majesty, we are not making the desired progress yet in reducing gas flaring.\"\n\nIn her remarks, Victoria Ibezim-Ohaeri, Executive Director of Spaces for Change, noted the significance of\n\nof this year's dialogue, and the need to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060.\n\nHighlighting the ambitious target set by Nigeria's Climate Change Plan to cease gas burning by 2030, she stressed the critical need for collaborative efforts across sectors to manage climate change impacts and drive sustainable development.\n\nIbezim-Ohaeri expressed confidence that NED2024 will set a new standard for environmental protection within the nation's extractive industry.\n\n\"As we work towards mitigating climate change and preserving our local ecosystems, strengthening regulatory frameworks and enhancing compliance with environmental standards will be paramount.

non-payment of penalties,", "body": "The Senate has indicted International Oil firms, IOCs operating in Nigeria for their failure to remit gas-flaring penalties, as stipulated by the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nSimilarly the upper chamber also faulted the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) for aiding the IOCs to perpetrate such act by not effectively enforcing compliance of the oil firms with the PIA Act.\n\nThe Senate gave the verdict on Thursday during an engagement between the IOCs, management of the NUPRC and the Senate Committee on Gas chaired by Senator Jarigbe Agom to give account of their compliance with Metering, Gas Flaring, Decommissioning and abandonment plans.\n\nThe NUPRC who initially said they were not prepared to provide information on the gas flaring fines paid by the IOCs later gave answers to the Senators on their supervisory findings on the IOcs with regards to metering, gas flaring and decommissioning.\n\nOil firms involved include Shell Petroleum Development Company, Chevron and Total Energies while the committee threatened to sanction ExxonMobil Nigeria and Agip Company for failing to attend the meeting.\n\nAs revealed by the Jarigbe, backlogs of payment were found in the report submitted by the IOCs who all admitted to Gas flaring.\n\nJarigbe also faulted the companies for their non-compliance with the provisions of the PIA specifically on section 232, which provides for commissioning procedures and the exco account among others.\n\nThe meeting is premised on the need to address the environmental devastation caused by gas flaring particularly in the Niger Delta region and the World Bank report of a significant loss of potential revenue, estimated between $761.2 million and $893.1 million in 2022 alone due to gas flaring.\n\nDuring the interaction, the IOCs told the lawmakers that they had successfully reduced gas flaring by 97 percent and committed to achieving 100 percent reduction by the end of the year.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun Nigeria"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

AFP\n\nMANILA: Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte resigned on Wednesday from the cabinet of President Ferdinand Marcos and another key post, in the latest sign that her alliance with Marcos Jr has crumbled.\n\nMarcos had accepted Duterte's resignation from the posts of education minister and vice chair of an anti-insurgency task force, Presidential Communications Secretary Cheloy Garafil said in a statement, adding that the vice president did not provide a reason for the move.\n\nDuterte, who will remain vice president, said in a press conference that her \"resignation is not because of weakness but because of true concern for teachers and the youth.\"\n\nIn the Philippines, where the president and vice president are elected separately, without a cabinet position, the vice president's powers are largely limited to ceremonial roles.\n\nThe Marcos and Duterte families joined forces in 2022 with Sara Duterte standing as Marcos' vice-presidential running mate, allowing him to tap the Duterte family's huge support base and seal a comeback for the disgraced Marcos dynasty.\n\nThat alliance was always expected to collapse, but analysts were surprised by how soon the gloves came off after Marcos' predecessor, and Sara's father, Rodrigo Duterte, accused the president in January of using drugs.\n\nDuterte's son, the mayor of Davao city, also called for Marcos' resignation at the time, and Sara did not object to the calls either. \"It is the break we have all been waiting for,\" Jean Encinas-Franco, a political science professor at the University of the Philippines, said of the vice president's decision to step down from her cabinet post.\n\nFranco said Sara Duterte, who continues to enjoy high trust ratings based on independent opinion polls, would now have more leeway to criticise Marcos' policies.\n\nSince coming to power in 2022, Marcos has reversed Rodrigo Duterte's pro-China stance and pivoted back to the United States, granting Washington greater access to Philippine bases amid China's assertiveness in the South China Sea and near Taiwan.\n\nHe also brought to the fore a 2016 arbitral ruling, fortifying Manila's territorial claims in the South China Sea, which former president Rodrigo Duterte had largely set aside. -

comment during a rally in Davao City in late January, which opposed efforts to amend the 1987 Constitution.\n\nIn February, the Vice President stated that she and Marcos had no issues with each other despite the criticism from her father and brother, Davao City Mayor Sebastian \"Baste\" Duterte, toward the President.\n\nDespite his wife's feelings, Marcos said he saw no reason to replace Duterte

the University of the Philippines, said of the vice president's decision to step down from her cabinet post, suggesting that it would now give her more power to go against Marcos.\n\nDuterte, daughter of former president Rodrigo Duterte, was tipped to win the presidency in the 2022 elections, based on independent opinion polls, but she ran alongside Marcos, allowing the son of the late authoritarian leader to tap the Duterte family's huge support base and seal a comeback for the disgraced Marcos dynasty.\n\nBut the cracks in the alliance were laid bare several months into Marcos' presidency after he reversed many of his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte's policies from the South China Sea to the war on drugs as well as initiated potential peace talks with communist rebels.\n\nMarcos has also considered rejoining the International Criminal Court (ICC) which Duterte officially withdrew from in 2019 after the court's prosecutor then announced a preliminary examination into thousands of killings in Duterte's war on drugs.\n\nIn January, Rodrigo Duterte accused Marcos of using drugs, while his son, currently the mayor of Davao city, called on Marcos to resign, which Sara Duterte did not object to.\n\n\"This resignation is not off the cuff,\" said Aries Arugay, visiting senior fellow, ISEAS Yusof-Ishak Institute. \"This has something to do with widening distance of their positions in policy and politics.\"\n\nArugay believed Sara Duterte's resignation will give her the political space to oppose Marcos, which could potentially polarise the country. \"It is dynasty versus dynasty.\"\n\nUniversity of the Philippines' Franco also sees a possibility that Sara Duterte, who still enjoys high trust ratings, would contest the presidency in 2028, and endorse her set of candidates for the 2025 mid-term polls.\n\nRight now, Sara Duterte's role as the vice president, who is elected separately from the president, is largely ceremonial without a cabinet position.\n\nMarcos, on the other hand, is not eligible to run again for the top job as the constitution sets a single-six-year term limit for president.\n\nThe Philippines will hold mid-term elections in 2025 to choose half the Senate, elect congressmen, and local officials.\n\n\"The 2025 elections could be a referendum on which dynasty is stronger,\" said Arugay. \"It will be an indication where the winds are blowing.\"", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@staradvertiser.com", "name":

resignation from the posts of education minister and vice chair of an anti-insurgency task force, Presidential Communications Secretary Cheloy Garafil said in a statement, adding that the vice president did not provide a reason for the move.\n\nDuterte, who will remain vice president, said in a press conference that her \"resignation is not because of weakness but because of true concern

China's assertiveness in the South China Sea and near Taiwan.\n\nHe also brought to the fore a 2016 arbitral ruling, fortifying Manila's territorial claims in the South China Sea, which former president Rodrigo Duterte had largely set aside.\n\nA major blow to the Marcos-Duterte relationship came late last year when Marcos said the government was considering rejoining the International Criminal Court, nearly five years after Rodrigo had withdrawn membership over objections to a bid by the court to investigate a bloody anti-narcotics campaign under him.", "source": {"uri":

It came a week after she said that UniTeam, which propelled her and Marcos to victory in the 2022 elections, no longer existed as they were no longer candidates running for public office.\n\nThe Presidential Communications Office (PCO) disclosed her decision to reporters and on its Facebook page at around 2:40 p.m., barely 20 minutes after she submitted her \"irrevocable resignation\" letter to Marcos.\n\nREAD: First lady bares beef with Sara for laughing at 'addict' claim\n\n\"At 2:21 pm of 19 June 2024, Vice President Sara Duterte went to Malaca\u00f1ang and tendered her resignation as member of the Cabinet, secretary of the Department of Education and vice-chairperson of the NTF-Elcac, effective 19 July 2024,\" PCO Secretary Cheloy Garafil said.\n\nGarafil said Duterte \"declined to give a reason\" for her decision to step down from the Department of Education (DepEd) and the NTF-Elcac.\n\nREAD: Bongbong: Liza's beef with Sara 'won't affect our working relationship'\n\n\"She will continue to serve as Vice President. We thank her for her service,\" the PCO chief said in her brief statement.\n\n30-day transition plan\n\nIn her letter, Duterte said she prepared a 30-day \"transition plan\" for DepEd's academic strands and the different boards and councils chaired by DepEd and the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO) \"for a proper and orderly turn-over\" to her successor.\n\nAs education secretary, Duterte served as president of the SEAMEO Council.\n\n\"I shall remain of service to the country through the various programs, activities and projects of the Office of the Vice President (OVP). I thank you for the opportunity to have served as a member of your Cabinet,\" she told the President.\n\nDuterte said in her resignation letter that she would continue her \"services\" and \"projects\" as Vice President.\n\nSince her election in 2022, Duterte created over 10 satellite offices around the country as part of the OVP's efforts to \"extend\" their \"services\" to Filipinos such as provision of burial and medical assistance.\n\nFlagged by COA\n\nBut this was flagged by the Commission on Audit (COA), saying it bypassed the country's procurement laws.\n\nAccording to the OVP, the satellite offices were also part of another project to distribute school supplies packed in backpacks to students in several rural areas in the country that was called \"PagbaBAGo.\"\n\nThe OVP also has tree-planting projects and gift-giving to the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe PCO and DepEd did not reply to queries from reporters on whether Duterte met the President and personally handed him her resignation letter, what his reaction was and whether he would appoint an officer in charge for DepEd.\n\nPrior to her resignation, Duterte's last known interaction with the President was at a May 21 meeting in Malaca\u00f1ang where she presented options in the change of the school calendar.\n\nBefore this, the two former allies were last seen together in public at the May 18 graduation rites of the Philippine Military Academy in Baguio City.\n\nWhat went before\n\nDuterte's relationship with Marcos became the subject of speculation since she quit the Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats as its member and chairperson last year.\n\nThis was after the House demoted Duterte's ally, former President and Pampanga Rep. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, to just one of the lower chamber's deputy speakers. Arroyo previously held the post of House senior deputy speaker.\n\nThe Lakas-CMD is led by Speaker Martin Romualdez, Marcos' cousin and Duterte's campaign manager in the 2022 elections.\n\nIn mid-April this year, first lady Liza Araneta-Marcos admitted in an interview that she was hurt when the Vice President merely laughed at allegations that Mr. Marcos was stoned or under the influence of illegal drugs.\n\nIn an anti-Charter change rally in Davao City earlier this year, Duterte's father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, accused Marcos of being \"bangag\" (stoned). On another occasion, he also called the President a \"crybaby\" for flying to the United States amid the Philippines' escalating dispute with China over the West Philippine Sea.\n\nShe 'crossed the line'\n\nAraneta-Marcos said the Vice President \"crossed the line\" by just laughing at her father's claims, especially that the younger Duterte was an alter-ego and ally of Mr. Marcos as the education secretary.\n\nThe Vice President remarked that it was not part of her mandate as a government official to respond to the first lady's personal feelings.\n\nIn comments to the media, the Chief Executive said his working relationship with Duterte remained the same although he described his ties with the Duterte family as \"complicated.\"\n\nMr. Marcos also repeatedly stressed that he would keep Duterte as education secretary as she was neither incompetent nor corrupt.\n\nThe President also took to social media to greet Duterte on her 46th birthday last May 31, as he thanked her for her hard work and love of country as education secretary.\n\nFirst crack\n\nThe first crack in the ties between Marcos and Duterte may be traced to the early days of the administration when he appointed Gilberto Teodoro Jr. as his defense secretary.\n\nMonths before the May 2022 elections, Marcos said that Duterte, a lawyer, wanted the post in case they won. He even said it was a \"good idea.\" But for undisclosed reasons, he chose Teodoro.\n\nReacting to the President's decision, Duterte said that \"seeing the way things are at the moment, I expect that people who want to see the new administration to fail will fabricate intrigues about my loyalty and the DND position to break the UniTeam.\"\n\n\"The UniTeam wants a stable Philippines and the most harmonious administration possible,\" she said.\n\nAbout a week before they took their oaths of office following the elections, the military formed a new unit, called the Vice Presidential Security and Protection Group. Traditionally, it is the Presidential Security Group that provides security for the two highest officials of the country and visiting dignitaries.\n\nDuterte acknowledged that a \"request\" was made to form such a unit, in anticipation of \"future elections\" and the possibility of \"strained relations\" between the President and Vice President.\n\nP650-M 'secret funds'\n\nAnother major disappointment on the part of Duterte may have also been the lack of support from Malaca\u00f1ang as she battled criticisms from the public and Congress of her requests for confidential funds for DepEd and the OVP. As a result Congress eventually scrapped P650 million in \"secret funds\" for her two offices.\n\nMalaca\u00f1ang was mum during the deliberations for the 2024 budget despite its quick approval of Duterte's request for P125 million in confidential funds for the first six months they were in office in 2022. Duterte came under fire for using all the funds in just under two weeks.\n\nIn a speech on Oct. 4, 2023, she called critics of the proposed funding \"enemies of peace\" who had \"insidious motivations.\"\n\nResignation statement\n\nIn a statement she read at the DepEd central office in Pasig City, Duterte said she resigned not \"out of weakness\" but of \"concern\" for teachers and students and highlighted the changes and progress made in the agency under her two-year leadership.\n\nShe said that teachers were the \"cornerstone\" of any education system and the projects done in schools for additional classrooms and the launching of a new curriculum from kindergarten to Grade 10 students were among other changes implemented during her time as DepEd secretary.\n\n\"I did not do this alone, nor do I claim to have done so,\" she said. \"To our teachers, words can never capture how grateful the nation is for your sacrifices, for your passion, and for your unrelenting commitment to rearing the youth.\"\n\nShe then disclosed that she sought an audience with the President earlier in the day but did not say that they spoke with each other.\n\n\"My fellow Filipinos, my resignation was not out of weakness, but brought by my concern to teachers and to the Filipino youth,\" Duterte said in Filipino.\n\n\"I may not be your education secretary anymore, but I will continue to be a mother -- a mother that will continue to look after the welfare of every teacher and student in the country,\" she said.\n\nNot taking questions\n\nShe did not take questions from reporters and left after reading her statement.\n\nDepEd spokesperson Michael Poa, in a message to reporters later in the day, said that they would not be taking questions about Duterte's resignation \"during the transition period\" with the new upcoming DepEd secretary.\n\nIn recent months, Duterte made public statements that contradicted the policies of the administration.\n\nLast December, Duterte openly opposed holding \"exploratory talks\" between the Philippine government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) on a possible peace deal.\n\nThe government and the NDFP signed the Oslo Agreement and both parties agreed to come up with a framework that could eventually lead them back to the negotiating table.\n\nReds, Cha-cha, China\n\nThe Vice President, known for making Red-tagging remarks, urged the President to reconsider the exploratory talks and reject an \"agreement with the devil.\"\n\nShe questioned the granting of amnesty to rebels, saying it was \"not the path to peace.\"\n\nDuterte opposed the campaign for a Charter change through people's initiative led by Romualdez and called on Filipinos to \"safeguard\" the 1987 Constitution, which her father once wanted to revise during his administration.\n\nAs for the criminal charges against televangelist Apollo Quiboloy, a staunch supporter of the Dutertes, the Vice President condemned the hearings in the Senate on his cases, as well as the recent attempt by the police to serve an arrest warrant on the fugitive in Davao City.\n\nWhile she wailed against Quiboloy's plight, her critics say she has not spoken against China's incursions into the West Philippine Sea and attacks against Filipino fishermen and resupply missions for troops at Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal. -- with a report from Inquirer Research", "source": {"uri": "newsinfo.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julie_m_aurelio@newsinfo.inquirer.net", "name": "Julie M.

Presidential Communications Secretary Cheloy Garafil said in a statement adding that no reasons were given by her for stepping down.\n\nDuterte, who will remain vice president, said in a press conference that her \"resignation is not because of weakness but because of true concern for teachers and the youth\".\n\nHer resignation affirmed what political observers had predicted all along that

According to the statement, Duterte, 46, \"declined to give a reason\" for her resignation, but would remain on as vice president.\n\nIn the Philippines, the presidency and vice presidency are elected separately, and the positions are often held by members of opposing parties.\n\nIn her own statement, Duterte said that she had submitted one month's notice to ensure a \"proper and orderly transition\" for her successor.\n\n\"My resignation is not borne out of weakness, but was brought along by my concern for teachers and Filipino youth,\" she said, according to BenarNews. \"I may no longer be the secretary of education, but I will continue to closely monitor and stand up for the sake of the teachers and students if needed.\"\n\nWhile this was not explicit about her reasons for leaving the cabinet, the reason is clear enough. For the past six months, Marcos and Duterte's father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, have been engaged in open political conflict, sniping at each other in the press.\n\nThe war of words has strained the political compact between the two powerful political clans, which joined forces ahead of the 2022 presidential election and won an overwhelming victory. Marcos won the presidency with 58.77 percent of the vote, more than 30 points clear of his nearest rival, while Duterte was catapulted into the vice presidency with 61.53 percent of votes. Her nearest rival won less than 18 percent.\n\nBut a number of incidents and disagreements over the past year have revealed the fragility of the \"Uniteam\" alliance. Much of the tension seems to have originated with, and been magnified by, the increasingly erratic behavior of former President Duterte. The 79-year-old former leader has been especially critical about plans to amend the Philippine Constitution, accusing Marcos' legislative allies, including his cousin, House Speaker Martin Romualdez, of scheming to lift term limits and tighten their grip on power. (Philippine presidents are limited to a single six-year term.)\n\nIn a January speech, Duterte warned that these moves could lead to Marcos experiencing the same fate as his father, the late dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos, who was overthrown amid a mass uprising in 1986. The speech was given at one of a number of \"prayer rallies\" protesting changes to the Constitution, some of which have also been attended by Sara Duterte. He repeated this claim at several subsequent rallies, including one in April, in which he criticized the administration's foreign policy and said that any attempt by Marcos to extend his tenure would \"destroy the country.\"\n\nMarcos has also criticized Duterte's brutal anti-drug campaign, raising concerns that he might agree to hand Duterte over to the International Criminal Court in The Hague as part of its ongoing investigation into drug killings. In turn, Duterte has been critical of Marcos' more forceful policy on the intensifying disputes with China in the South China Sea, an issue that he downplayed in the interests of good relations with Beijing.\n\nOn a number of occasions, he has also accused Marcos of being a drug addict - a standby in Duterte's arsenal of insults. Marcos has responded by speculating that Duterte's mind has been damaged by prolonged fentanyl use.\n\nUp until now, Sara Duterte has pledged to carry out her duties as education secretary, and refused to exit the governing coalition. Her resignation appears to suggest that the relationship between the Marcos and Duterte clans has broken down entirely and that her continued service in the cabinet is no longer tenable.\n\nAll this has set up a bizarre situation in which the Duterte family, after scaling the pinnacle of Philippine politics, has been transformed into the de facto leader of the Philippine opposition. The clan will no doubt get to work electing its allies at next year's midterm elections before mounting another \"outsider\" assault on the presidency in 2028.", "source": {"uri": "thediplomat.com",

This earned her the ire of first lady Liza Araneta-Marcos.\n\nIt was the first time that a member of the first family had aired any grievance in public against the vice president since the \"UniTeam\" of Marcos and Duterte won the elections two years ago.\n\nThe vice president was the first government appointee of Marcos when he assumed office on June 30, 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a press conference at the DepEd office in Pasig City after she resigned, Duterte said she set a July 19 date for her exit because she wanted an orderly transition in the DepEd.\n\nShe also said her resignation was \"not a sign of weakness\" but a reflection of her concern for all teachers and the Filipino youth.\n\nShe added that she would remain in the service to the country through the various programs, activities and projects of the Office of the Vice President.\n\nA large part of her prepared statement dealt with gains that the DepEd made under her leadership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuterte said the new \"Matatag\" Education Curriculum would be implemented nationwide for the first time when schools open on July 29 and pointed to the strides in the procurement process for textbooks and learning materials for the new curriculum.\n\nShe also said 2,000 last-mile schools were given internet access through satellite technology, while 305 of them were connected through fiber.\n\nDuterte also highlighted the programs she created for teachers, including the establishment of a National Educator's Academy, the removal of administrative tasks, the provision of personal accident insurance and a 30-day no-mandatory or voluntary tasks break.\n\nDuterte thanked the department's staff, led by its management committee, central office and regional offices, as well as the national government, local government units, private and developmental partners, and other organizations for bringing her plans to fruition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I did not do this alone, nor do I claim to have done so. I would like to take this moment to express my most profound gratitude to those who took part in this journey,\" Duterte said in Filipino.\n\nShe lastly thanked teachers, noting that no words will capture how grateful the Philippines is for their sacrifices, passion and unrelenting commitment to rearing the youth.\n\n\"In the two years that we have been together, our story that we created is a story of our bond to achieve a nation for children and a child-friendly nation,\" Duterte said.\n\nShe vowed to continue to monitor and stand up for every teacher and student for a \"stronger Philippines.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormer Palace spokesman Harry Roque said Duterte's resignation from the Cabinet positions has effectively dissolved the \"UniTeam,\" which was the campaign name of Duterte, when she ran alongside Mr. Marcos in 2022.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Wednesday, Roque said the vice president would become a leader of the opposition to the Marcos administration.\n\n\"Uniteam has formally been dissolved, and she has just become the leader of the opposition,\" Roque said. He added that the Philippines now had \"a real leader.\"\n\nLong overdue\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuterte's frequent critic, ACT Teachers party-list Rep. France Castro, said the vice president's resignation was long overdue.\n\n\"Finally, VP Sara has resigned from DepEd. I wished she did it earlier so there would be a DepEd Secretary who came from the education sector and knows what they are going to do,\" Castro said in Filipino.\n\nShe said that the past two years were wasted in fixing the crisis in education and resolving the benefits and salaries of teachers and educational support personnel.\n\nCastro added that her resignation from the Cabinet marks an \"open war\" between former allies and the escalation of hostilities between the two camps.\n\nAlbay 1st District Rep. Edcel Lagman said Duterte's resignation would lead to a resolution of the alarming crisis in Philippine education.\n\nHe added that Duterte's incumbency was a \"liability to teachers and students.\"\n\nLagman said he hoped her replacement would come from the ranks of experienced and dedicated educators who can efficiently steer and professionally manage the country's educational system.\n\nHe added that Duterte's departure from a prime position in the President's Cabinet ends with finality what he called \"increasingly tenuous partisan relations between the Duterte and Marcos political blocs.\"\n\n\"This terminates absolutely the Uniteam,\" Lagman said.\n\nSenate President Francis Escudero said Duterte's resignation was inevitable due to the developing feud between her family and the members of the first family.\n\n\"I believe her resignation was inevitable when her father..., siblings and allies started attacking [the President] and members of the first family,\" Escudero said.\n\nIts inevitability became more pronounced when she remained silent on these attacks and did not support specific policies such as the administration's stand on the West Philippine Sea and the filing of child abuse and human trafficking charges against Apollo Quiboloy, her father's spiritual adviser.\n\nWITH JAVIER JOE ISMAEL AND ARIC JOHN SY CUA", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "catherine_s_valente@manilatimes.net", "name": "Catherine S.

reversed Rodrigo Duterte's pro-China stance and pivoted back to the United States, granting Washington greater access to Philippine bases amid China's assertiveness in the South China Sea and near Taiwan.\n\nHe also brought to the fore a 2016 arbitral ruling, fortifying Manila's territorial claims in the South China Sea, which former president Rodrigo Duterte had largely set aside.\n\nA major blow to the Marcos-Duterte relationship came late last year when Marcos said the government was considering rejoining the International Criminal Court, nearly five years after Rodrigo had withdrawn membership over objections to a bid by the court to investigate a bloody anti-narcotics campaign under him.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors":

Marcos, meanwhile, has claimed that Duterte was a long time user of the opioid fentanyl.\n\nCheloy Garafil, a spokeswoman for the president, confirmed Dutere's resignation on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAlong with the education post, Duterte also quit as the head of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict.\n\nThe position is high-profile and allowed the vice president to broadcast her criticisms of the communist rebels, who have been waging one of Asia's longest running insurgencies. Marcos on the other hand has opened preliminary peace talks with the insurgents, which were ended by his predecessor in 2017.\n\nIn a statement, Duterte said she had given one month's notice to ensure \"proper and orderly transition\" for her successor.\n\n\"My resignation is not borne out of weakness, but was brought along by my concern for teachers and Filipino youth,\" she said. \"I may no longer be the secretary of education, but I will continue to closely monitor and stand up for the sake of the teachers and students if needed.\"\n\nDuterte remains vice president despite resigning from her cabinet posts. In the Philippines, the president and vice president are elected separately - a mechanism that serves as a check and balance for the country's top post.\n\nBut both Duterte and Marcos had agreed on the alliance in a so-called \"Unity Team\" to beat Leni Robredo, the country's vice president in ex-leader Duterte's term who critically monitored his drug war.\n\nLast year, opposition lawmaker France Castro called for an investigation into alleged anomalies in the allocation of 650 million pesos (U.S. $11.4 million) to the Office of the Vice President and the Department of Education, both of which were overseen by Duterte.\n\nHer father, Rodrigo, subsequently made a death threat against the congresswoman, according to a criminal complaint that was later dismissed by the ombudsman.\n\nOpposition party Akbayan welcomed Duterte's decision to resign, saying it was \"long overdue.\"\n\n\"Her tenure at DepEd has been marred by massive controversies, particularly the murky waters of her multi-million confidential funds that have raised more eyebrows than standards,\" Akbayan said in a statement.\n\nAnalysts say hostilities between the two political dynasties began as the elder Duterte grew wary that Marcos would hand him over to the International Criminal Court (ICC), which is investigating his bloody anti-drugs campaign. Marcos has publicly said he would not allow ICC investigators into the country.\n\nThe two leaders are also at odds over the direction of Philippine relations with China, with Marcos taking a much firmer stance than his predecessor against Beijing's actions in the South China Sea.\n\nThe Marcos and Duterte clans formed an alliance in the 2022 presidential election.\n\nLawyer Harry Roque, a spokesman for the former president, on Wednesday said the alliance had been \"formally dissolved\" and Sara was now the leader of the opposition.\n\n\"The line has been drawn.

This move highlights the breakdown in their political alliance. Duterte cited true concern for teachers and youth as her reason for resigning.\n\nPhilippine Vice President Sara Duterte resigned on Wednesday from the cabinet of President Ferdinand Marcos and another key post, in the latest sign that her alliance with Marcos Jr has crumbled. Marcos had accepted Duterte's resignation from the posts of education minister and vice chair of an anti-insurgency task force, Presidential Communications Secretary Cheloy Garafil said in a statement, adding that the vice president did not provide a reason for the move.\n\nDuterte, who will remain vice president, said in a press conference that her \"resignation is not because of weakness but because of true concern for teachers and the youth.\" In the Philippines, where the president and vice president are elected separately, without a cabinet position, the vice president's powers are largely limited to ceremonial roles.\n\nThe Marcos and Duterte families joined forces in 2022 with Sara Duterte standing as Marcos' vice-presidential running mate, allowing him to tap the Duterte family's huge support base and seal a comeback for the disgraced Marcos dynasty. That alliance was always expected to collapse, but analysts were surprised by how soon the gloves came off after Marcos' predecessor, and Sara's father, Rodrigo Duterte, accused the president in January of using drugs.\n\nDuterte's son, the mayor of Davao city, also called for Marcos' resignation at the time, and Sara did not object to the calls either. \"It is the break we have all been waiting for,\" Jean Encinas-Franco, a political science professor at the University of the Philippines, said of the vice president's decision to step down from her cabinet post. Franco said Sara Duterte, who continues to enjoy high trust ratings based on independent opinion polls, would now have more leeway to criticise Marcos' policies.\n\nSince coming to power in 2022, Marcos has reversed Rodrigo Duterte's pro-China stance and pivoted back to the United States, granting Washington greater access to Philippine bases amid China's assertiveness in the South China Sea and near Taiwan. He also brought to the fore a 2016 arbitral ruling, fortifying Manila's territorial claims in the South China Sea, which former president Rodrigo Duterte had largely set aside.\n\nA major blow to the Marcos-Duterte relationship came late last year when Marcos said the government was considering rejoining the International Criminal Court, nearly five years after Rodrigo had withdrawn membership over objections to a bid by the court to investigate a bloody anti-narcotics campaign under him.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated

We thank her for her service,\" Garafil said.\n\nSenate President Francis Escudero said Duterte's resignation was \"inevitable from the time her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, and her siblings and allies started attacking the President and members of the First family.\"\n\n\"It's inevitability became more pronounced when she was already silent and not expressing her support on certain policy issues such as the West Philippine Sea, the Bagong Pilipinas Hymn, and the Quiboloy cases and attempted arrest, (among others),\" Escudero said.\n\nHouse Deputy Minority leader France Castro said Duterte's resignation \"marks the open war between the former allies and the upcoming escalation of hostilities between the two camps.\"\n\nIn April, President Marcos came to Duterte's defense, saying there was no need to replace her as Education Secretary amid questions on her loyalty as an alter-ego of the Chief Executive.\n\nMr. Marcos also assured the public their working relationship will not be affected amid the feud between the Vice President and First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos.\n\nMrs. Marcos earlier did not mince words in expressing her disappointment at the Vice President, saying the latter crossed the line for laughing at insinuations that the President is a drug user.\n\n\"Bad shot na yan sa akin (She's a bad shot to me),\" Mrs. Marcos said in an earlier interview.\n\n\"I was hurt because my husband will do everything to protect you... You ran together right? But you will go to a rally where they called your President a drug user, right? You're going to laugh - is that the proper thing to do?\" Mrs. Marcos added.\n\nRelations between the Marcos and Duterte families have plummeted in the past two years.\n\nFronting a rally of supporters in his home city Davao on January 28, Rody Duterte accused Mr. Marcos of being a \"drug addict,\" while his youngest son, Mayor Sebastian Duterte, said Mr. Marcos should resign.\n\nThe President hit back the next day, claiming that his predecessor's long-term use of the powerful opioid fentanyl had taken a toll on his health.\n\nThe former president has also urged the military and police to unseat Mr. Marcos if he pursued his proposal to amend the constitution, and threatened to get his southern home region of Mindanao to secede.\n\nThe Vice President also recently questioned the police operation against Quiboloy, saying her father's spiritual adviser - who is wanted for acts of child abuse, sexual abuse, and human trafficking, among others - was being unfairly targetted.\n\nIn a press conference yesterday, Duterte said she resigned \"not out of weakness but brought out of true compassion for our teachers and Filipino youth.\"\n\n\"Although I will no longer manage the department, we will continue to promote the quality of education that our Filipinos deserve...Even though I am not the standing Education Secretary, I will remain a mother who monitors and stands up for the welfare of each teacher and student in the Philippines,\" she added.\n\nEscudero said the Vice President has every right to have policy differences with her Chief Executive.\n\n\"I believe that people love and respect her precisely for that... for having and fighting for what she believes in and for her own beliefs,\" he said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Aquilino Pimentel III, for his part, urged Mr. Marcos to immediately appoint the next DepEd Secretary.\n\n\"He or she must be someone who has dedicated his or her life to education and can show the track record for it,\" he said.\n\nEditor's Note: This is an updated article.

exits Marcos cabinet as their alliance crumbles", "body": "MANILA, June 19 (Reuters) - Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte resigned on Wednesday from the cabinet of President Ferdinand Marcos and another key post, in the latest sign that her alliance with Marcos Jr has crumbled.\n\nMarcos had accepted Duterte's resignation from the posts of education minister and vice chair of an anti-insurgency task force, Presidential Communications Secretary Cheloy Garafil said in a statement, adding that the vice president did not provide a reason for the move.\n\nDuterte, who will remain vice president, said in a press conference that her \"resignation is not because of weakness but because of true concern for teachers and the youth.\"\n\nIn the Philippines, where the president and vice president are elected separately, without a cabinet position, the vice president's powers are largely limited to ceremonial roles.\n\nThe Marcos and Duterte families joined forces in 2022 with Sara Duterte standing as Marcos' vice-presidential running mate, allowing him to tap the Duterte family's huge support base and seal a comeback for the disgraced Marcos dynasty.\n\nThat alliance was always expected to collapse, but analysts were surprised by how soon the gloves came off after Marcos' predecessor, and Sara's father, Rodrigo Duterte, accused the president in January of using drugs.\n\nDuterte's son, the mayor of Davao city, also called for Marcos' resignation at the time, and Sara did not object to the calls either.\n\n\"It is the break we have all been waiting for,\" Jean Encinas-Franco, a political science professor at the University of the Philippines, said of the vice president's decision to step down from her cabinet post.\n\nFranco said Sara Duterte, who continues to enjoy high trust ratings based on independent opinion polls, would now have more leeway to criticise Marcos' policies.\n\nSince coming to power in 2022, Marcos has reversed Rodrigo Duterte's pro-China stance and pivoted back to the United States, granting Washington greater access to Philippine bases amid China's assertiveness in the South China Sea and near Taiwan.\n\nHe also brought to the fore a 2016 arbitral ruling, fortifying Manila's territorial claims in the South China Sea, which former president Rodrigo Duterte had largely set aside.\n\nA major blow to the Marcos-Duterte relationship came late last year when Marcos said the government was considering rejoining the International Criminal Court, nearly five years after Rodrigo had withdrawn membership over objections to a bid by the court to investigate a bloody anti-narcotics campaign under him.\n\nReporting by Mikhail Flores and Karen Lema; Additional reporting by Neil Jerome Morales; Editing by

Duterte, went to Malaca\u00f1ang and tendered her resignation as Member of the Cabinet, Secretary of the Department of Education and Vice Chairperson of the NTF-ELCAC, effective 19 July 2024.\n\n\"She declined to give a reason why. She will continue to serve as Vice President. We thank her for her service.\"\n\nAt a press briefing yesterday afternoon at the DepEd complex in Pasig, Duterte announced her resignation as education secretary.\n\n\"Earlier today, June 19, 2024, I sought an audience with the President and tendered my resignation as the Secretary of Education effective July 19, 2024,\" Duterte told reporters.\n\n\"I have given my 30-day notice to ensure the proper and orderly transition for the benefit of the next secretary,\" she added.\n\nIn her resignation letter addressed to President Marcos, she said she had already prepared a transition plan for all the nine strands of the DepEd, as well as for posts chaired by DepEd and the Southeast Asia Ministers of Education Organization. Duterte is SEAMEO Council president.\n\n\"I shall remain of service to the country through the various programs, activities and projects of the Office of the Vice President. I thank you for the opportunity to have served as a member of your Cabinet,\" she added.\n\nAmid criticisms and apparently soured relations between their families, Duterte said her resignation should not be construed as weakness.\n\n\"This is brought by true concern for our teachers and the Filipino youth. While I will not be heading the DepEd, I will continue to push for the quality of education that Filipinos deserve,\" she said.\n\n\"While I will no longer be the secretary of education, I will remain a mother who looks after and would stand up for the welfare of all teachers and students in the Philippines,\" she added.\n\nDuterte declined to answer questions about details of her resignation and the reason she decided to leave her posts within the Marcos Cabinet.\n\nQuestions about whether Duterte would still be aligned with the Marcos administration now swirl as the President looks for her replacement.\n\nCracks in UniTeam?\n\nSpeculations that there were cracks in the UniTeam mounted when former president and now Pampanga Rep. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, an ally of Sara, was demoted from House senior deputy speaker to deputy speaker. Sara resigned from the Romualdez-led Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats party after Arroyo's demotion.\n\nRumors of a rift among UniTeam members intensified after the House of Representatives, dominated by Marcos' allies, realigned the combined P650-million confidential funds of the Office of the Vice President and DepEd to agencies securing the West Philippine Sea.\n\nThe House lawmakers' decision to strip the agencies led by Sara of intelligence funds angered her father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, who labeled the legislative chamber as the \"most rotten\" institution and accused Speaker Martin Romualdez of \"swallowing\" discretionary funds.\n\nHouse members denied the accusation and approved a resolution affirming the chamber's honor and integrity. Two Duterte allies who did not sign the resolution - Arroyo and Davao City Rep. Isidro Ungab - lost their posts as deputy speakers.\n\nThings turned personal last January when Duterte claimed in an expletive-laden speech in Davao that Marcos is a drug addict, an allegation that the President just laughed off.\n\nDuterte also warned Marcos that the attempt of some administration allies to effect Charter change through a people's initiative signature campaign could lead to his ouster, similar to the fate of the President's late father and namesake in 1986. Marcos responded by linking Duterte's tirades to his use of the highly addictive drug fentanyl.\n\nDespite the word war, Marcos claimed that the UniTeam was still intact and \"vibrant.\"\n\nIn April, the political landscape took a surprising turn when First Lady Liza Marcos disclosed that she has come to view Sara negatively because the Vice President laughed when her father was calling Marcos \"bangag\" or high on drugs during a rally in Davao City. Sara responded by saying that Liza's personal feelings had nothing to do with her functions in the government.\n\nMarcos had also defended Sara from critics calling for her removal from the Cabinet, saying the issue did not affect his working relations with his runningmate in the 2022 elections.\n\nSara made headlines this month when she said that the UniTeam had already served its purpose.\n\n\"The UniTeam was a tandem during the 2022 elections. The elections are over, we won and we are grateful to those who supported us,\" she said during the 126th Independence Day celebration in Davao City last June 12.\n\nWhile Marcos repeatedly praised Sara's performance as a member of the Cabinet, they did not agree on some issues.\n\nWhen the Marcos administration and the National Democratic Front, which negotiates on behalf of communist rebels, agreed to seek a \"principled and peaceful\" resolution to the conflict, Sara said history has proven that the insurgents are not sincere in pursuing peace. She even called the government's joint statement with the NDF in Oslo as an \"agreement with the devil.\"\n\nSara has also drawn flak for her supposed silence on China's aggression in the West Philippine Sea. Marcos, who has issued strong statements against China's incursions in the strategic sea lane, defended Sara from her critics, saying discussing the dispute is not part of her mandate.\n\nMarcos also tweaked DepEd's proposals for the changing of the school calendar. Under the first option, there will be 182 school days, including 15 in-person Saturday classes.\n\nThe second option will have 167 school days and no Saturday onsite classes. Marcos said a 167-day school calendar would be \"too short\" while holding Saturday classes would entail more resources and \"jeopardize\" the well-being of students.\n\nHe then asked the DepEd to adjust the end of the school year from March 31 to April 15, 2025 so students could finish the 182 class days without having to go to school on Saturday.\n\nMarcos and Sara were last seen together in public during the Philippine National Police Academy graduation in Cavite last April. Their last known closed door meeting took place on May 21 in Malaca\u00f1ang, where they tackled proposals to amend the school calendar. - Alexis Romero", "source": {"uri": "philstar.com", "dataType":

19.\n\n\"Every story, no matter how beautiful, has to end,\" she told reporters.\n\n\"Even if I will not be the head of the department of education, I will continue to be a mother who will watch and stand for the rights of every teacher and every student in the Philippines.\"\n\nShe thanked the teachers, partner agencies and the national government for their commitment to improving the country's education system.\n\nRelations between the Marcos and Duterte families have plummeted in the past two years.\n\nFronting a rally of supporters in his home city Davao on January 28, Duterte accused Marcos of being a \"drug addict\", while his youngest son Sebastian Duterte said Marcos should resign.\n\nMarcos hit back the next day, claiming that his predecessor's long-term use of the powerful opioid fentanyl had taken a toll on his health.\n\nNeither man provided evidence of the other's alleged drug use.\n\nThe former president has also urged the military and police to unseat Marcos if he pursued his proposal to amend the constitution, and threatened to get his southern home region of Mindanao to secede.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.net.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

This came 20 minutes after she informed her followers on Facebook about her \"irrevocable resignation\".\n\nLast week, she quit the Uni-Team, the electoral alliance that allowed Marcos and Duterte to run the unprecedented ticket that won in May 2022.\n\nNow the team is no longer necessary since, as Duterte indicated, the two would no longer run together for public office.\n\nThe split was not only predictable, but it might lead an open hostility between the two, even to fresh elections.\n\nFor both, the team was not a finish line, but a springboard. Marcos needed it to complete the rehabilitation of his father, the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr, which Duterte had already begun during his term in office.\n\nMarcos Jr is taking a different path than his predecessor on public order, budget management, and international relations, including closer military cooperation with the United States to contain China (as well as better relations with Western partners in general), which Duterte opposes because it requires a quid pro quo on respect for human rights.\n\nUnder the Philippine constitution, Rodrigo Duterte was not eligible to run for a second term. His daughter's vice presidency would have provided an opportunity for him to play a future role in the Senate or as vice president if she was elected president. Both father and daughter share ideas, character, and experience as mayor of Davao, the largest city in southern Philippines.\n\nIt is no coincidence that Sara Duterte has been very busy since her election building up support for herself, not exclusively based on the fate (and contradictory statements) of her father.\n\nThe same goes even more for her relationship with the incumbent president. As VP, she set up scores of offices across the country to help Filipinos with burial assistance and medical care.", "source": {"uri": "asianews.it", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asia News.it"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Duterte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sara Duterte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Marcos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ferdinand Marcos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_Duterte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo Duterte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Task_Force_to_End_Local_Communist_Armed_Conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Communications_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential Communications Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_(Philippines)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Department of Education (Philippines)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipinos", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filipinos"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsiaNews", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AsiaNews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senate of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davao_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Davao City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Davao City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Virtual_Corporations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Virtual Corporations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.asianews.it/files/img/sara-duterte-122nd-anniversary-of-the-martyrdom-of-dr-jose-rizal-873-fb0259.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664054", "eventUri": "eng-9664054", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

their alliance crumbles", "body": "MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte resigned on Wednesday from the cabinet of President Ferdinand Marcos and another key post, in the latest sign that her alliance with Marcos Jr has crumbled.\n\nMarcos had accepted Duterte's resignation from the posts of education minister and vice chair of an anti-insurgency task force, Presidential Communications Secretary Cheloy Garafil said in a statement, adding that the vice president did not provide a reason for the move.\n\nDuterte, who will remain vice president, said in a press conference that her \"resignation is not because of weakness but because of true concern for teachers and the youth.\"\n\nIn the Philippines, where the president and vice president are elected separately, without a cabinet position, the vice president's powers are largely limited to ceremonial roles.\n\nThe Marcos and Duterte families joined forces in 2022 with Sara Duterte standing as Marcos' vice-presidential running mate, allowing him to tap the Duterte family's huge support base and seal a comeback for the disgraced Marcos dynasty.\n\nThat alliance was always expected to collapse, but analysts were surprised by how soon the gloves came off after Marcos' predecessor, and Sara's father, Rodrigo Duterte, accused the president in January of using drugs.\n\nDuterte's son, the mayor of Davao city, also called for Marcos' resignation at the time, and Sara did not object to the calls either.\n\n\"It is the break we have all been waiting for,\" Jean Encinas-Franco, a political science professor at the University of the Philippines, said of the vice president's decision to step down from her cabinet post.\n\nFranco said Sara Duterte, who continues to enjoy high trust ratings based on independent opinion polls, would now have more leeway to criticise Marcos' policies.\n\nSince coming to power in 2022, Marcos has reversed Rodrigo Duterte's pro-China stance and pivoted back to the United States, granting Washington greater access to Philippine bases amid China's assertiveness in the South China Sea and near Taiwan.\n\nHe also brought to the fore a 2016 arbitral ruling, fortifying Manila's territorial claims in the South China Sea, which former president Rodrigo Duterte had largely set aside.\n\nA major blow to the Marcos-Duterte relationship came late last year when Marcos said the government was considering rejoining the International Criminal Court, nearly five years after Rodrigo had withdrawn membership over objections to a bid by the court to investigate a bloody anti-narcotics campaign under him.", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Marcos, meanwhile, has claimed that Duterte was a long time user of the opioid fentanyl.\n\nCheloy Garafil, a spokeswoman for the president, confirmed Dutere's resignation on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAlong with the education post, Duterte also quit as the head of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict.\n\nThe position is high-profile and allowed the vice president to broadcast her criticisms of the communist rebels, who have been waging one of Asia's longest running insurgencies. Marcos on the other hand has opened preliminary peace talks with the insurgents, which were ended by his predecessor in 2017.\n\nIn a statement, Duterte said she had given one month's notice to ensure \"proper and orderly transition\" for her successor.\n\n\"My resignation is not borne out of weakness, but was brought along by my concern for teachers and Filipino youth,\" she said. \"I may no longer be the secretary of education, but I will continue to closely monitor and stand up for the sake of the teachers and students if needed.\"\n\nLast year, opposition lawmaker France Castro called for an investigation into alleged anomalies in the allocation of 650 million pesos (U.S. $11.4 million) to the Office of the Vice President and the Department of Education, both of which were overseen by Duterte.\n\nHer father, Rodrigo, subsequently made a death threat against the congresswoman, according to a criminal complaint that was later dismissed by the ombudsman.\n\nOpposition party Akbayan welcomed Duterte's decision to resign, saying it was \"long overdue.\"\n\n\"Her tenure at DepEd has been marred by massive controversies, particularly the murky waters of her multi-million confidential funds that have raised more eyebrows than standards,\" Akbayan said in a statement.\n\nAnalysts say hostilities between the two political dynasties began as the elder Duterte grew wary that Marcos would hand him over to the International Criminal Court (ICC), which is investigating his bloody anti-drugs campaign. Marcos has publicly said he would not allow ICC investigators into the country.\n\nThe two leaders are also at odds over the direction of Philippine relations with China, with Marcos taking a much firmer stance than his predecessor against Beijing's actions in the South China Sea.\n\nThe Marcos and Duterte clans formed an alliance in the 2022 presidential election.\n\nLawyer Harry Roque, a spokesman for the former president, on Wednesday said the alliance had been \"formally dissolved\" and Sara was now the leader of the opposition.\n\n\"The line has been drawn.

Her alliance with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. fell apart over differences on key issues, including the handling of territorial disputes with China and the allegations against religious leader Apollo Carreon Quiboloy.\n\nPhilippine Vice President Sara Duterte announced her resignation Wednesday from her roles as education secretary and head of an anti-insurgency body. This decision comes as her collaboration with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. disintegrated over crucial disagreements, particularly efforts to arrest a religious leader accused of child abuse and Manila's approach to escalating territorial disputes with Beijing.\n\nCommunications Secretary Cheloy Garafil stated that President Marcos accepted Duterte's resignation, which will take effect on July 19. Despite stepping down from the Cabinet, Duterte will continue to serve as vice president. The 46-year-old did not provide specific reasons for her resignation, though ongoing political hostilities between her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, and Marcos are widely seen as a factor.\n\nElected as vice president alongside Marcos under a hastily formed unity ticket, Duterte's resignation signifies a break in an alliance that had united two influential political dynasties but soon faced significant challenges. Notably, the younger Duterte's resignation highlights the growing rifts in Philippine politics, especially regarding ties with China and the handling of internal security issues.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Duterte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sara Duterte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Marcos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ferdinand Marcos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_disputes_in_the_South_China_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Territorial disputes in the South China Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheloy_Garafil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cheloy Garafil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_Duterte", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo Duterte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Political_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Political Science", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Burnout", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Burnout", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/19_06_2022_16_54_07_9347538.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664054", "eventUri": "eng-9664054", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 885, "textEnd": 892}], "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

What has happened since she was elected?\n\nDavao City mayor and presidential daughter Sara Duterte is elected vice president in the 2022 Philippine elections. She ran for the second highest position in the country in tandem with Marcos.\n\nDuterte obtains 32,208,417 votes - or 61.53% of the total votes cast. She gets more votes than Marcos' 31,629,783.\n\nShe initially filed for reelection as Davao city mayor, but eventually ran for vice president after filing as substitute under Lakas-CMD.\n\nPresumptive president Marcos announces that Duterte will take the education portfolio. He says that she \"has agreed to take the brief\" of DepEd, but does not confirm whether she asked for it.\n\n\"'Tinanong ko sa kanya kung kaya niya 'yung trabaho dahil mahirap ang trabaho ng secretary of education, pero nag-agree naman siya, at palagay ko kasama na diyan dahil she is a mother,\" he said. (I asked her if she wants the job because it is hard to be secretary of education, but she agreed, and I think part of her reason was because she is a mother.)\n\nBut Marcos, prior to winning in the 2022 elections, said that Duterte wanted to lead the Department of National Defense (DND). A Philippine Daily Inquirer report in January 2022 quoted the then-presidential candidate as saying that it surprised him, but added that \"it seems like it's going to be a good idea.\"\n\n\"Sabi niya, \"Yung problem of security, problem of terrorism, kami sa Davao biktima kami lahat diyan at marami na kaming mga programa na ginagawa na nakatulong,'\" he said. (She told me, \"that \"Davao City has seen the problems of security and terrorisms, so we have a lot of programs that helped address those.\")\n\nDuterte is designated as co-vice chairperson of the NTF-ELCAC.\n\nNational Security Adviser Eduardo A\u00f1o, who also serves as co-vice chairperson, says that Duterte's \"unstinting commitment [to] the cause of NTF-ELCAC will undoubtedly be invaluable,\" adding that her engagement will make the task force \"reinvigorated and more active.\"\n\nHer designation to the government agency comes as she has found herself under fire multiple times for red-tagging. As DepEd secretary, Duterte has tagged multiple groups as being front organizations for the communist movement.\n\nDuterte resigns from Lakas-CMD following significant controversies at the House of Representatives involving her long-time ally former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and House Speaker Martin Romualdez, Marcos' first cousin.\n\nThe House under Romualdez has demoted Arroyo from senior to regular deputy speaker. In a statement expressing support for her mentor, Duterte says that she is \"here today because of the trust of the Filipino people in me to lead and serve them and the country, and this cannot be poisoned by political toxicity or undermined by execrable political power play.\"\n\nThe Commission on Audit (COA) releases the annual audit report covering the 2022 budget of the Office of the Vice President (OVP). Among the findings include Duterte's office spending P125 million on confidential funds during the latter part of the year, a far cry from Leni Robredo's zero confidential fund spending.\n\nThis development opens a floodgate of criticism against Duterte, who also does not hold back in her response to critics.\n\nIt was discovered that Duterte sent a letter in August 2022 to the Department of Budget and Management to give her office more funds.\n\nThe COA confirms that the OVP under Duterte spent its 2022 confidential funds amounting to P125 million within 11 days.\n\nThis information, uncovered during plenary deliberations at the House of Representatives, corrects earlier reports that the OVP spent it within 19 days.\n\nThe House of Representatives announces that it is blocking the confidential funds requested in the 2024 budget of five government agencies, including two headed by Duterte: DepEd and the OVP.\n\nDuterte's office requested P500 million in confidential funds while DepEd proposed P150 million, moves that earned massive scrutiny both from the government and the public.\n\nDuterte asks Marcos to reconsider his decision to restart peace negotiations with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP). In a video message, the Vice President says that it is \"an agreement with the devil.\"\n\n\"Gagamitin nila itong peace negotiation sa pagtraydor sa pamahalaan at paglinlang sa taumbayan,\" Duterte says. (They will use this peace negotiation to betray the government and fool the people.)\n\nDuterte urges Filipinos to \"safeguard\" the 1987 Philippine Constitution in the face of ongoing efforts for charter change. She says the signature campaign happening across the country is exploiting the poverty of Filipinos.\n\nDuterte says she is running in the 2025 election, but does not specify what position.\n\nThe Vice President's younger brother, Davao City Mayor Sebastian Duterte, calls on Marcos to resign if he does not have love and aspirations for the Philippines.\n\nSara Duterte attends a rally that calls for the resignation of Marcos. It is organized by supporters of the fugitive preacher Apollo Quiboloy, a close ally of her father Rodrigo. She does not give a statement during the event.\n\nDuterte echoes the statement of his brother, Davao City 1st District Representative Paolo Duterte, who earlier said that it was not the job of the DepEd secretary and vice president to \"demonize China or any country for that matter.\"\n\n\"I think the statement of [my brother] about me and the West Philippine Sea is comprehensive,\" the Vice President says.\n\nMarcos defends Duterte's silence, saying that it is \"not the role of the Vice President or the secretary of education to talk about China.\"\n\n(I was hurt, because my husband will do everything to protect you. You ran together, didn't you? Our motto was we would rise together. Then you attend a rally where your president is being called high. Then you're going to laugh. Is that right? Even Leni never did that.)\n\n\"Bilang tao, karapatan ni Unang Ginang Liza Marcos para makaramdam ng sama ng loob at galit. Subalit ang kaniyang personal na damdamin ay walang kinalaman sa aking mandato bilang opisyal ng pamahalaan,\" the Vice President says.\n\n(As human, First Lady Liza Marcos has the right to feel upset and angry. But her personal feelings have nothing to do with my mandate as a government official.)\n\nDuterte tenders her resignation from the Cabinet effective July 19. In her letter, she says that she will \"remain of service to the country\" through the OVP. - with reports from Dwight de Leon/Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news",

The alliance of the scions of two authoritarian leaders combined the voting power of their families\u00b4 political strongholds but compounded worries of human rights activists. The alliance, however, rapidly faced political headwinds.\n\nEarly this year, the former president accused Marcos\u00b4 legislative allies of plotting to amend the constitution to lift term limits and warned that could lead to him being ousted by a public uprising like his father, the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, in 1986. He also accused Marcos of being a drug addict.\n\nMarcos laughed off the allegations and claimed his predecessor was using fentanyl, a powerful opioid.\n\nFILE - Sara Duterte, daughter of outgoing populist president of the Philippines, signs documents during her oath taking as vice president in her hometown in Davao city, southern Philippines, Sunday, June 19, 2022. Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte resigned Wednesday, June 19, 2024, from President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s Cabinet in the latest sign that their whirlwind political alliance has unraveled over key differences, including government efforts to arrest a religious leader accused of sex abuses and Manila's handling of its escalating territorial disputes with Beijing. (AP Photo/Manman Dejeto, File)\n\nDuterte and his daughter, Sara, back Apollo Carreon Quiboloy, the leader of a Philippines-based church known as the Kingdom of Jesus Christ who has been sought by Philippine authorities for his alleged involvement in child abuse and exploitation. Quiboloy had also been indicted on a raft of charges in the United States, including conspiracy, sex trafficking of children and sex trafficking by force. He has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nOn China\u00b4s increasingly aggressive moves against the Philippines in the South China Sea, Marcos has become one of the most vocal critics of Beijing\u00b4s actions, in sharp contrast to the vice president\u00b4s refusal to comment on the issue.\n\nHer father nurtured cozy ties during his presidency with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin while often criticizing the security policies of the United States and its Western allies. Marcos, who took office in 2022, backpedaled by rapidly boosting security ties with Washington, which he said needed to have a presence in Asia as a counterweight to China.\n\nMarcos also announced that he would shift his predecessor\u00b4s brutal crackdown against illegal drugs which killed thousands of mostly poor suspects, to refocus on the rehabilitation of drug dependents. The killings under Duterte sparked an investigation by the International Criminal Court as a possible crime against humanity.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

Imee Marcos has vowed to stand by Vice President Sara Duterte despite her quitting the Cabinet of President Marcos, the senator's brother.\n\n\"My trust and confidence in our friendship and in your kindness and integrity remain the same,\" Senator Marcos said in Filipino on Wednesday.\n\n\"I am with you in every step of the way in this fight for the country,\" she added.\n\nFor his part, Sen. Bong Go thanked Duterte for her service in her short stint as Department of Education (DepEd) secretary.\n\n\"There is always a time for everything. This is the time to prioritize the people's welfare,\" Go said in Filipino.\n\nMeanwhile, former president and former House senior deputy speaker Pampanga 2nd District Rep. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo distanced herself from any issues surrounding the Vice President's resignation from her Cabinet posts.\n\n\"I understand the Vice President did not give a reason for resigning from the Cabinet. Thus, I am not in a position to give a statement,\" said Arroyo, a close friend and political ally of Duterte.\n\nBeginning of everything\n\nThe resignation of Vice President Duterte as DepEd secretary and vice chair of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict signals the start of a full-blown 'war' with the Marcos administration, according to former presidential spokesman Harry Roque.\n\n\"This signals the beginning of everything,\" said Roque.\n\nBefore the Vice President quit the Cabinet, there were already hints of her stepping down. Duterte was even expected to tender her resignation from her Cabinet posts last June 8, sources said. She deferred the date to June 19 when she went to Malaca\u00f1ang and made clear her resignation before President Marcos himself.\n\nThe Vice President hinted of cracks in the relationship with the Marcos administration when she earlier said there is no longer a UniTeam with Marcos, as it was only good during the 2022 elections when they were still candidates.\n\nShe even naughtily quipped that one should remain beautiful and be able to wear two-piece when oppressed.\n\nVarious groups supporting the Vice President were said to have also prepared for what will happen after her resignation effective July 19.\n\nBut Duterte gave assurance that she will still look after the concerns of the education sector even if she is no longer DepEd secretary.\n\nThe Vice President is still expected to grace certain functions as head of the education department between now and July 19.\n\nSupporters have been waiting\n\nSupporters of Vice President Duterte have been waiting for her resignation from the Cabinet amid the drop in the popularity and trust rating of President Marcos, former chief legal counsel Salvador Panelo said on Thursday.\n\n\"The resignation was not surprising. In fact, those who support and love her have been expecting this,\" said Panelo, who served as chief legal counsel of former president Rodrigo Duterte.\n\n\"They (supporters) felt that it's time for Inday Sara to resign as she is affected by the drop in the popularity and trust rating of the administration of President Marcos,\" Panelo added.\n\n\"Many have expressed their discontentment on the administration amid its failure to address various problems being faced by the country. They really felt it's time for Inday Sara to leave (the Cabinet),\" he said.\n\nPanelo said that the environment has become uncomfortable for Vice President Duterte. \"It becomes hostile for her that she needs to free herself so that she will be able to fully express herself on everything she wants to tell the Filipino people on what's happening in our country,\" he said.\n\nPanelo added that Duterte will remain to perform her functions as vice president despite her resignation from the Cabinet.\n\n'Hired vloggers'\n\nFormer president Duterte and his \"hired vloggers\" should be blamed for the resignation of Sara from the Marcos Cabinet, presidential adviser on poverty alleviation Larry Gadon said yesterday.\n\nGadon, however, defended the Vice President against criticism by some netizens that she resigned due to her alleged incompetence.\n\n\"Her resignation from the Marcos Cabinet was a welcome development,\" he said.\n\nGadon pointed out that \"the duty of the Vice President is to assist President Marcos and to perform other functions that may be assigned to her by the Chief Executive.\"\n\n\"How could she do that when her father and his vlogger-supporters were calling the President as a drug user in their funded rallies,\" Gadon said.\n\nPolitical tension\n\nFor former Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission chairman Greco Belgica, it was the political tension between the Duterte family and the Marcos administration that led to her resignation.\n\nIn a message to The STAR, Belgica said that the House of Representatives also cut the budget for the DepEd that were intended for the programs of the agency.\n\n\"This (budget cut) will anger the teachers and students and will reflect on the Vice President,\" Belgica said, and it \"only shows that the 1987 Constitution granted so much power to the president and Congress, as they can control the budget of officials who are not considered as allies.\"\n\n\"That's the power which should be removed or lessen as often it is abused,\" he said, adding that it justifies the need to amend the present Constitution through constitutional convention (con-con).\n\nAccording to Belgica, under a federal form of government, the budget of an agency will not be affected despite the differences of national officials.\n\n\"We are respectfully including Vice President Sara on the list (of proposed con-con delegates), together with the group of President Marcos, First Lady Liza Marcos, former vice president Leni Robredo and other factions,\" he added. - Edith Regalado, Bella Cariaso", "source": {"uri":

Edcel Lagman expressed hope that the issues hounding Philippine education will be resolved as a result of Duterte's resignation.\n\nLagman also hoped that Duterte's replacement would come from the ranks of \"experienced and dedicated educators who can efficiently steer and professionally manage\" the country's educational system.\n\nHe noted that Duterte's departure from a prime position in the President's Cabinet signifies the end of the \"increasingly tenuous partisan relations\" between the Marcos and Duterte political power blocs.\n\nACT Teachers party-list Rep. France Castro expressed optimism that President Marcos would appoint a DepEd secretary with experience in the field who would truly serve the education sector.\n\nGABRIELA Party-list Rep. Arlene Brosas said Duterte's resignation as DepEd secretary highlights the urgent need to appoint a genuine public servant who will prioritize uplifting the long-neglected education sector.\n\n\"From the very start, the Vice President had no real intention of addressing the crisis in our education system,\" Brosas said.\n\nBrosas described Duterte's exit as a political move in preparation for the 2025 elections to \"set the stage for a potential power struggle\" between the Duterte and Marcos factions.\n\nManila Rep.

It is the first major and politically significant resignation in the nearly three-year-old Marcos Cabinet. Sara, who had initially wanted to become defense secretary, was Marcos Jr.'s first Cabinet appointee, and is now the first to bail out.\n\nMany administration officials have expressed relief that the unstable relationship between her and Malaca\u00f1ang has finally been resolved, but it may have set off its own wave of domestic problems.\n\nThe resignation takes effect on July 19, according to Sara. A lot of things could still happen during that one-month period. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is obviously taking no chances and has summoned all officials of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, down to director level, to a conference in Manila on June 24, presumably to assess the situation. He has also called on the military and the police to tighten security measures in an abundance of caution.\n\nThe resignation puts an end to the Marcos Jr.-Duterte \"UniTeam\" that captured the 2022 presidential election in an unprecedented landslide. And it puts Sara Duterte, who got more votes than Marcos Jr. in that election, at the head of a new political force that could provide real opposition to the Marcos government, if it decides to do so.\n\nSara is likely to replace her father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, who was the first to break ties with Marcos Jr. on the issue of proposed Charter change, saying the President was pushing the proposed people's initiative of House Speaker Martin Romualdez in order to extend his term beyond 2028. Duterte has also accused Marcos Jr. of using illegal drugs and called on his followers in Mindanao to consider a possible \"secession\" or a \"revolutionary government,\" if needed.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nAt the same time, the resignation has provoked fears that Marcos Jr. might be compelled to withdraw his support for Duterte in his ongoing fight with the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague, which wants to investigate him for \"crimes against humanity\" in connection with alleged killings in his bloody drug war in Mindanao. Marcos Jr. has repeatedly said he will not allow the ICC to investigate Duterte, but a number of legislators continue to call on the government to cooperate with the ICC process. Some of them even want Marcos Jr. to consider rejoining the ICC, from which Duterte withdrew in 2019 after Mindanao lawyer Jude Sabio filed charges against him for crimes against humanity in connection with the alleged drug killings.\n\nWhile these fears loom large, some other highly informed sources seem convinced that the administration is ready to throw in the towel on the ICC issue, and this is what triggered Sara's unexplained resignation. There are unconfirmed reports that the ICC prosecutors have succeeded in gaining access to some key witnesses against Duterte, who are being positioned to testify against him at The Hague. Whether or not these reports are true, Sara's resignation is believed to be the first reaction to them; it should be followed by a reaction from the former president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wasn't quite clear whether Marcos Jr. personally received Sara's resignation letter and decided not to say anything about it. But in an unusual press statement, Secretary Cheloy Grail of the Presidential Communications Office (PCO) said \"she declined to give any reason why. She will continue to serve as vice president. We thank her for her service.\" Two things seem amiss in this statement.\n\nFirst, since Sara did not offer to resign her elective position, there was absolutely no need for the PCO to say she would \"continue to serve as vice president.\" And although the President chose not to say anything about it, PCO could have said, the President is grateful for her services, instead of saying, \"We thank her for her service.\" To begin with, who is \"we\" in this sentence? PCO? It does not have the legal personality to say this; its only role is to report that the vice president has resigned, and that the President has accepted her resignation, without comment.\n\nHow will this resignation affect the administration? Will it have any destabilizing effect? The situation bears watching. Duterte is the first Filipino president from Mindanao, so he claims Mindanao as his bailiwick. If he decides to take a stand in Mindanao to actively resist any ICC effort to subject him to its legal process, will the Mindanaoans unite to protect him from possible arrest?\n\nIn his previous public dialogue with Mindanaoans, Duterte has dropped broad hints that what happened to Marcos Sr. in 1986 could happen to Marcos Jr. during his term if he wasn't extra careful. Marcos Sr. was ousted by rebellious military generals with US support during the bloodless EDSA \"revolution.\" Duterte has repeated this veiled warning not once but a few times. This coincides with certain retired military groups circulating manifestos against corruption and other ills, and calling for reforms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, both the President and AFP Chief of Staff Gen. Romeo Brawner have acknowledged the existence of destabilization efforts within the administration. This seems to be a mistake which, I hope, is not repeated.

The alliance of the scions of two authoritarian leaders combined the voting power of their families' political strongholds but compounded worries of human rights activists. The alliance, however, rapidly faced political headwinds.\n\nEarly this year, the former president accused Marcos' legislative allies of plotting to amend the constitution to lift term limits and warned that could lead to him being ousted by a public uprising like his father, the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, in 1986. He also accused Marcos of being a drug addict.\n\nMarcos laughed off the allegations and claimed his predecessor was using fentanyl, a powerful opioid.\n\nDuterte and his daughter, Sara, back Apollo Carreon Quiboloy, the leader of a Philippines-based church known as the Kingdom of Jesus Christ who has been sought by Philippine authorities for his alleged involvement in child abuse and exploitation. Quiboloy had also been indicted on a raft of charges in the United States, including conspiracy, sex trafficking of children and sex trafficking by force. He has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nOn China's increasingly aggressive moves against the Philippines in the South China Sea, Marcos has become one of the most vocal critics of Beijing's actions, in sharp contrast to the vice president's refusal to comment on the issue.\n\nHer father nurtured cozy ties during his presidency with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin while often criticizing the security policies of the United States and its Western allies. Marcos, who took office in 2022, backpedaled by rapidly boosting security ties with Washington, which he said needed to have a presence in Asia as a counterweight to China.\n\nMarcos also announced that he would shift his predecessor's brutal crackdown against illegal drugs which killed thousands of mostly poor suspects, to refocus on the rehabilitation of drug dependents. The killings under Duterte sparked an investigation by the International Criminal Court as a possible crime against humanity.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Her resignation from the other posts she had in Marcos' Cabinet was accepted by the president and takes effect July 19, Communications Secretary Cheloy Garafil said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nAlso Read | Vladimir Putin's North Korea Visit: Russian President Putin, Kim Jong Un Sign Strategic Partnership Treaty Calling for Mutual Assistance if Either Gets Attacked.\n\nDuterte, 46, did not cite any reason for her resignation, Garafil said, but there have been open political hostilities between her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, and Marcos.\n\nShe ran as the vice-presidential running mate of Marcos, the son and namesake of an ousted dictator, under a hastily forged unity ticket and won with huge margins in 2022. The alliance of the scions of two authoritarian leaders combined the voting power of their families' political strongholds but compounded worries of human rights activists. The alliance, however, rapidly faced political headwinds.\n\nAlso Read | Hajj 2024: At Least 550 Die During This Year's Hajj Pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia Amid Intense Heat.\n\nEarly this year, the former president accused Marcos' legislative allies of plotting to amend the constitution to lift term limits and warned that could lead to him being ousted by a public uprising like his father, the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, in 1986. He also accused Marcos of being a drug addict.\n\nMarcos laughed off the allegations and claimed his predecessor was using fentanyl, a powerful opioid.\n\nDuterte and his daughter, Sara, back Apollo Carreon Quiboloy, the leader of a Philippines-based church known as the Kingdom of Jesus Christ who has been sought by Philippine authorities for his alleged involvement in child abuse and exploitation. Quiboloy had also been indicted on a raft of charges in the United States, including conspiracy, sex trafficking of children and sex trafficking by force. He has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nOn China's increasingly aggressive moves against the Philippines in the South China Sea, Marcos has become one of the most vocal critics of Beijing's actions, in sharp contrast to the vice president's refusal to comment on the issue.\n\nHer father nurtured cosy ties during his presidency with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin while often criticising the security policies of the United States and its Western allies. Marcos, who took office in 2022, back-pedalled by rapidly boosting security ties with Washington, which he said needed to have a presence in Asia as a counterweight to China.\n\nMarcos also announced that he would shift his predecessor's brutal crackdown against illegal drugs which killed thousands of mostly poor suspects, to refocus on the rehabilitation of drug dependents. The killings under Duterte sparked an investigation by the International Criminal Court as a possible crime against humanity.

The alliance, however, rapidly faced political headwinds.\n\nEarly this year, the former president accused Marcos' legislative allies of plotting to amend the constitution to lift term limits and warned that could lead to him being ousted by a public uprising like his father, the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, in 1986. He also accused Marcos of being a drug addict.\n\nMarcos laughed off the allegations and claimed his predecessor was using fentanyl, a powerful opioid.\n\nDuterte and his daughter, Sara, back Apollo Carreon Quiboloy, the leader of a Philippines-based church known as the Kingdom of Jesus Christ who has been sought by Philippine authorities for his alleged involvement in child abuse and exploitation.\n\nQuiboloy had also been indicted on a raft of charges in the United States, including conspiracy, sex trafficking of children and sex trafficking by force. He has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nOn China's increasingly aggressive moves against the Philippines in the South China Sea, Marcos has become one of the most vocal critics of Beijing's actions, in sharp contrast to the vice president's refusal to comment on the issue.\n\nHer father nurtured cozy ties during his presidency with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin while often criticising the security policies of the United States and its Western allies.\n\nMarcos, who took office in 2022, backpedaled by rapidly boosting security ties with Washington, which he said needed to have a presence in Asia as a counterweight to China.\n\nMarcos also announced that he would shift his predecessor's brutal crackdown against illegal drugs which killed thousands of mostly poor suspects, to refocus on the rehabilitation of drug dependents. The killings under Duterte sparked an investigation by the International Criminal Court as a possible crime against humanity.

there's no OIC yet,\" Garafil said via Viber.\n\nIn her resignation letter to President Marcos, Duterte emphasized her intent for a smooth transition: \"I hereby tender my irrevocable resignation as Secretary of the Department of Education and Co-Vice Chairperson of the NTF-ELCAC effective 19 July 2024.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribune.net.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jom_garner@tribune.net.ph", "name": "Jom Garner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "tiziana_celine_piatos@tribune.net.ph", "name": "Tiziana Celine Piatos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "gabriela_baron@tribune.net.ph", "name": "Gabriela Baron", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UniTeam_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UniTeam Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loren_Legarda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Loren Legarda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_(Philippines)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Department of Education (Philippines)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Philippine_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2022 Philippine presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Senate of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Marcos", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ferdinand Marcos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Task_Force_to_End_Local_Communist_Armed_Conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Duterte", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sara Duterte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Organisation of Islamic Cooperation"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_Duterte", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo Duterte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_Education_(Philippines)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of Education (Philippines)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheloy_Garafil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cheloy Garafil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davao_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Davao City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Davao City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Luddism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Luddism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Burnout", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Burnout", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/tribune%2F2024-06%2F03672af7-4cfe-4bcb-a8a5-4cbc6a4525de%2Freceived1205049343830538.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664054", "eventUri": "eng-9664054", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 1947, "textEnd": 1954}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

She also has the capabilities of a lawyer and a leader of the executive branch.\n\nDuterte stands firm on issues against the Marcos administration and has the \"highest net satisfaction and approval ratings\" among government officials, he said.\n\n\"She proved in her resignation that she is not an opportunist and that it's not in her desire to remain in office,\" Roque said.\n\nFinally, he said the vice president will not only fight for the interests of those in Mindanao but all Filipinos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I hope she accepts the challenge of time,\" Roque said.\n\nAnother Facebook post from Roque showed what the vice president accomplished as Education secretary, including the Matatag curriculum, Catch-Up Friday, and overtime pay for all teachers.\n\nOn Wednesday, Duterte resigned as Education secretary and as vice chairman of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-Elcac).\n\n'Ideological'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, LP President and Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman said the LP remained as the \"ideological and conscientious\" opposition.\n\n\"Vice President Sara Duterte may assume the leadership of the partisan opposition to the Marcos Jr. administration, but the Liberal Party remains the ideological and conscientious opposition to both the current administration and Duterte's breakaway power bloc,\" Lagman said.\n\nIn a press conference on Thursday, Kabataan Rep. Raoul Manuel said he wanted to know if Duterte was in favor of abolishing the Elcac task force or the phasing out of traditional jeepneys.\n\nIf her stand on the two issues concurs with the stand of the administration, Duterte does not belong to the opposition, Manuel said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother former Duterte spokesman, Salvador Panelo, said the resignation of the vice president is a huge loss to the Marcos administration.\n\nPanelo said Sara is one of the six Cabinet members \"who have salvaged the dismal performance of the other department secretaries that has contributed immensely to the creeping discontent among the citizenry and dragged [President Marcos] to a low popular and trust rating.\"\n\nHe said Duterte's departure from the Cabinet \"was forthcoming given the hostile environment the vice president found herself in -- created by the allies of [the President] who were in a hurry to diminish and dislodge her enviable leading spot in the 2028 presidential race.\"\n\nThe demolition job on Duterte began with the ouster of her strong political ally, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, as senior deputy speaker and later as deputy speaker, Panelo said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This was followed by the almost unanimous approval of the removal of her confidential funds coming from the Office of the President,\" he said.\n\nThe failure of the President to defend Duterte \"on this issue added to her discomfort.

France Castro, Gabriela party-list Rep. Arlene Brosas, and Kabataan party-list Rep. Raoul Manuel questioned former presidential spokesperson Harry Roque's anointing of Duterte as the opposition leader.\n\nBrosas said that opposition stalwarts usually have a clean track record, which is why politicians oppose a ruling administration.\n\n\"Our position on that has been clear, she's not a true opposition. First, we say that the person has to have a clean record, right? That's why you are in the opposition...But here, there are corruption issues when you spent confidential funds (CFs) in 11 days,\" Brosas said, referring to reports that Duterte spent CFs transferred to the Office of the Vice President (OVP) in 2022.\n\n\"And second, she should push for human rights, but in that alone, she fails. She's a red-tagger, there's so many issues regarding human rights faced by (Vice President) Sara Duterte,\" she added.\n\nREAD: Quimbo: OVP's P125M secret fund in 2022 spent in just 11 days\n\nManuel, meanwhile, speculated that Roque labeled Duterte as an opposition only because they are opposed to a possible International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecution of her father, former president Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nThe older Duterte is facing crimes against humanity complaints before ICC for alleged human rights violations in the drug war he implemented.\n\nREAD: Trillanes: ICC expected to issue arrest warrant vs Duterte by June or July\n\n\"Maybe they called the Duterte camp as an opposition because they are opposed to an ICC investigation, opposed to the pursuit of justice for the victims of the fake drug war. But these things are being asked by the people because we want justice and accountability,\" Manuel said.\n\n\"If they do not want that, then they are not members of the opposition who serve the public. They are only opposing because they do not want the Marcoses in power, and they want to replace the ruling party with themselves,\" he added.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Presidential Communications Office relayed that Duterte has resigned from her posts as Education secretary and vice chairperson of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-Elcac).\n\nDuterte held a press briefing at the Department of Education (DepEd) office to confirm her resignation.\n\nREAD: Sara Duterte resigns as DepEd secretary, says Palace\n\nAfter the Vice President stepped down from her post, Roque said that Duterte emerged as the new leader of the opposition. Officials of the Liberal Party (LP) countered this, saying that their bloc is still the opposition to the Marcos and Duterte factions.\n\nREAD: VP Sara as new opposition leader? LP's De Lima doesn't think so\n\nFor Castro, if the Vice President wants to be a part of the opposition, she has to support causes raised by the public, like the fight against traditional jeepney phaseout.\n\n\"What former Secretary Harry Roque said regarding Sara being a leader of the position is unbelievable and unacceptable. Because she has not given out statements supporting the public's cause, right? Like for the PUV (public utility vehicle) modernization, she has not said anything,\" Castro said.\n\n\"Up to now, she still carries the policies that she believed in before resigning as secretary of the Department of Education, like in topics such as support for the NTF-Elcac and other issues that she has been silent on,\" she added.\n\nOther personalities also lauded Duterte's resignation from the DepEd post, which supposedly allows the government to clean up whatever mess was left.\n\nManila 3rd District Rep. Joel Chua on Wednesday said that the Matatag curriculum crafted during the time of Duterte as Education secretary must be put on hold, along with alleged \"brainwashing\" in the DepEd.\n\nINQUIRER.net

Rappler's Bonz Magsambol reports.\n\nOn Wednesday, June 19, Vice President Sara Duterte resigned from President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s Cabinet, relinquishing her position as education secretary.\n\nDuterte did not say why she resigned. She insisted that it was not a sign of weakness.\n\nCritics said the Marcos-Duterte alliance was doomed from the start, that it was a mere \"marriage of convenience.\"\n\nDuterte feuded with House Speaker Martin Romualdez, the President's cousin. Romualdez denied Duterte's request for millions in confidential funds in this year's national budget.\n\nEarlier this year, the Duterte family began attacking Marcos and accused him of using illegal drugs. Since then, the Vice President has openly opposed some of Marcos' policies like the proposal to revive peace talks and charter change.\n\nIn April, First Lady Liza Marcos confirmed suspicions she and the Vice President were not on good terms.

The possibilities include Ms Duterte becoming an opposition leader fielding her own slate against Mr Marcos in the mid-term election next year and further afield, gunning for the presidency in 2028.\n\nWith her resignation, Ms Duterte is now free to position herself as an opposition figure against her erstwhile ally, said ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute fellow Dr Aries Arugay.\n\n\"Their power-sharing agreement was not feasible because of many factors, like significant policy differences. But this also has something to do with the Marcoses not being able to really give the concessions that the Dutertes thought they earned or they deserved because they helped catapult the Marcoses into power,\" he told The Straits Times.\n\nMr Marcos and Ms Duterte may end up endorsing different sets of candidates in next year's mid-term polls, when Filipinos vote for half of the members of the Senate and other local posts down to the village level, added Dr Arugay.\n\nMs Duterte could possibly upset Mr Marcos' agenda in his last four years of office if more candidates allied with her win during the mid-term polls next year, political science professor Dr Jean Encinas-Franco from the University of the Philippines told ST.\n\nMs Duterte resigned from her posts as education secretary and vice-chair of an anti-insurgency task force, without providing a reason. Her resignation is effective July 19 and she will remain as vice-president until her term officially ends in 2028.\n\n\"My resignation was not borne out of weakness but brought about by genuine concern for our teachers and Filipino youth,\" she said in a 12-minute media briefing later in the day, where she declined to take questions.\n\n\"I may no longer be your education secretary, but I will remain as a mother - a mother watching over and fighting over the rights of every teacher and student in the Philippines. This is for a stronger Philippines,\" she added.\n\nInstead, much of the briefing was spent recounting her achievements as education chief for the past two years, including introducing new learning material to kindergarten up to junior high school levels, and providing internet access to over 2,000 schools in far-flung areas in the country.\n\nThe Marcos and Duterte families joined forces in 2022 for the presidential election, with Ms Duterte standing as Mr Marcos' vice-presidential running mate, allowing Mr Marcos to tap the Duterte family's huge support base and seal a comeback for the disgraced Marcos dynasty.\n\nIn the Philippines, the president and vice-president are elected separately. Hence, candidates for the two highest posts in the land may run as a team or on opposing sides.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mara_cepeda@straitstimes.com", "name": "Mara Cepeda", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Marcos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ferdinand Marcos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_Duterte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo Duterte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISEAS\u2013Yusof_Ishak_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Duterte", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sara Duterte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coffin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Philippines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Straits_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Straits Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcos_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcos family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_(emblem)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seal (emblem)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet service provider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindergarten", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kindergarten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2024/06/19/20230814-brigadaeskwela-ph4.jpg?VersionId=SQNIexCXyr_2kvwoqdI5GVZGOKJzWF2R", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664054", "eventUri": "eng-9664054", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 197, "textEnd": 204}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 1829, "textEnd": 1836}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

She explained that \"Tambaloslos in Bisaya may be interpreted as a joke. It may also be interpreted as an insult.\"\n\nDuring the same day, Romualdez said efforts to destabilize the House and unseat him as Speaker should be nipped in the bud.\n\nVice President Duterte refuses to mention the President's middle name, Romualdez, in a speech during a Department of Education event.\n\nAt the \"Pasidungog,\" an event to pay tribute to the Office of the Vice President's stakeholders, Duterte acknowledged Marcos' \"all-out support\" for the OVP.\n\n\"Hindi ko na banggitin ang middle initial niya... Apo, alam mo 'yan na mahal kita,\" a smiling Duterte said, drawing laughter from the crowd.\n\nDuring the deliberations on the proposed 2024 budget, it was revealed that the OVP spent P125 million of its confidential funds in 2022 in just 11 days, even if the 2022 national budget did not provide for a budget item for confidential fund for the OVP.\n\nHouse leaders announced that they are considering realigning the proposed P500 million confidential funds of the OVP to security agencies where this fund is urgently needed.\n\nVice President Duterte hits back at confidential fund critics, saying those against the confidential fund are against peace and as such, those against peace are enemies of the state.\n\nThe House of Representatives officially strips OVP and four other agencies of over P1 billion of confidential fund under the proposed 2024 budget.\n\nDuring a prayer rally in Davao city that coincided President Marcos, Jr.'s Bagong Pilipinas rally in Manila, the Vice President's father and former President Duterte called Marcos \"bangag\", meaning high on drugs, as well as someone who wants to be a dictator just like his late father, President Ferdinand Marcos, Sr.\n\nMoreover, the Vice President's brother and Davao City mayor Sebastian Duterte said Marcos should step down from his post because he lacks vision for the country.\n\nThe Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency said the President was never on their drug watch list.\n\nOn the same day, the Vice President was still tasked by the President to be the caretaker while he was in Vietnam for a state visit despite the comments made against Marcos by father and son Rodrigo and Sebastian Duterte.\n\nBefore Marcos departs for Vietnam, the First Lady did not greet Duterte before she boarded the plane.\n\nJanuary 31, 2024\n\nThe Vice President thanks the President for the trust, saying she does not always need to agree with her family members.\n\nThe Vice President said herself and President Marcos, Jr. do not have problems with each other and they have a good relationship.\n\n\"We have no problem with each other. President Bongbong Marcos and I are doing good. We are okay in terms of our relationship,\" Duterte said when asked about her and the President.\n\nAsked about her ties with First Lady Liza Araneta Marcos, Sara said, \"I have no comment as of this time.\"\n\nApril 13, 2024\n\nPresident Marcos, Jr. defends his Vice President over criticisms that Duterte was not speaking out against Chinese aggression of Filipino vessels and personnel in the West Philippine Sea, saying that he is confident that the Vice President will personally talk to him in the event she disagrees with the policy of the administration.\n\nFirst Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos said she the Vice President is already on her bad side, given that she allowed her father to make disparaging comments on her husband and President Marcos, Jr.\n\nThe First Lady said she was hurt when Duterte attended a rally where the President was called \"bangag\" (high on illegal drugs).\n\n\"For me, nasaktan ako because my husband will do everything to protect you. You ran together 'di ba -- sama sama tayong babangon muli,\" Liza Marcos told journalist Anthony Taberna.\n\n(I was hurt because my husband will do everything to protect you. You ran together during the elections, right -- we will rise together.)\n\n\"Pupunta ka sa rally, tatawagin 'yung Presidente mong 'bangag,' 'di ba, you're going to laugh? Tama ba 'yan? Even Leni [Robredo] never did that,\" she added.\n\n(You went to a rally, then the President gets called bangag, and then you're going to laugh? Is that right? Even Leni [Robredo] never did that.)\n\nPresident Marcos, Jr. says there is no reason to replace the Vice President as Education chief, saying :Kapag hindi talaga marunong o corrupt, tatanggalin ka talaga namin. Hindi naman ganoon si Inday,\", referring to the Vice President's nickname.\n\n''Why? I don't see the reason behind that,'' Marcos said in an ambush interview in Occidental Mindoro.\n\n''Any of the Cabinet secretaries will be replaced kapag hindi nila ginagawa 'yung trabaho nila. All the other things are not part of the discussion,\" added Marcos.\n\n(They will be replaced if they are not doing their jobs.)\n\n\"Kapag hindi talaga marunong o corrupt, tatanggalin ka talaga namin. Hindi naman ganoon si Inday,'' emphasized the President.\n\n(If they are incompetent or corrupt, we will replace you. But Inday is not like that.)\n\nVice President Duterte resigns from Marcos cabinet. Duterte said her resignation as Secretary of the Department of Education (DepEd) was not due to weakness, but out of concern for teachers and students.\n\nShe said she gave a 30-day notice \"to ensure the proper and orderly transition for the benefit of the next Secretary.\"\n\n\"Mga kababayan, ang aking pagbibitiw ay hindi lulan ng kahinaan kundi dala ng tunay na malasakit para sa ating mga guro at kabataang Pilipino,\" she said.\n\n(Although I will not continue heading the Department, I will continue to promote the quality of education that Filipinos deserve.)\n\nDuterte refused to answer follow-up questions from the media after giving her statement. --VAL, GMA Integrated News", "source": {"uri": "gmanetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GMA Network"}, "authors": [{"uri": "llanesca_t_panti@gmanetwork.com", "name": "Llanesca T.

(LOOK: VP Sara Duterte's resignation letter as DepEd secretary, NTF-ELCAC vice chairperson)\n\nFor many observers, Duterte's decision signaled the end of the Uniteam alliance that brought them to power in 2022, and attention is now shifting to the future strategies of the once-united political camps.\n\nThe resignation has resulted in different reactions across the provinces, reflecting diverse political views.\n\nThe Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Pimentel wing said Duterte's decision to resign was \"long overdue,\" and only made the political divide between the Marcoses and Dutertes more pronounced.\n\nOther than the political landscape, \"her exit will not in any way affect basic education programs,\" said PDP-Pimentel wing acting secretary general Manuel Jaudian.\n\nThe PDP was the administration party during the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte, Sara's father. The party ended up divided as the group of the then-president dominated the party and isolated the faction of Senator Aquilino Pimentel III, son of the PDP's founder.\n\nThe Cagayan de Oro-based Jaudian said Sara would likely distance herself from her father's circle, maintain and strengthen her political party, the Hugpong ng Pagbabago (HNP), and field a full ticket for Senate seats this October for the 2025 elections.\n\nIn the Duterte family's hometown of Davao, opinions were varied. Retired dressmaker Inday Marging, for instance, bluntly said, \"It's very good that she resigned, because she achieved nothing in the department and failed to handle controversies.\"\n\nFormer National Irrigation Administration (NIA) chief Peter Lavina lamented Duterte's decision to quit and lashed out at the Marcos Jr. administration.\n\n\"The government lost its most productive Cabinet member. She likely resigned because she couldn't support an administration that curtails liberties and drags our country into unnecessary conflicts,\" said Lavina, who once served as a Davao City councilor.\n\nFormer Bayan Muna representative Carlos Zarate, who hails from Davao, said the move of Duterte as well as the Uniteam's collapse were long expected.\n\nZarate said her resignation confirmed the disintegration of the Uniteam, and that \"their alliance was based on selfish interests, not principles.\"\n\nHe said: \"This will now signal an open war for dominance of the two camps and their allies to hoodwink the people once again into supporting each own faction. The people should now be more discerning and vigilant and reject these two camps that caused much misery to our people and country.\"\n\nIn the Visayas, Negros Occidental Vice Governor Jeffrey Ferrer, a close ally of Duterte, said while Sara chose to quit as education secretary and NTF-ELCAC vice chairperson, \"she remains the Vice President and still holds the people's mandate.\"\n\nIn Zamboanga City, Councilor Rogelio Valesco said Duterte can focus more on her duties as the second-highest ranking official in the country now that she has quit the Marcos Cabinet.\n\nBut Dr. Myra Borja Mangkabung, superintendent of the Bangsamoro Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education Lamitan City Division of Schools, said she was concerned about how Duterte's resignation would affect the education department.\n\n\"The DepEd (Department of Education) is already improving, and with her resignation we will surely start all over again. It is sad that politics in the Philippines is so volatile and unstable,\" Mangkabung said.\n\nFor Hans Noel Balila, Supreme Student Council president of the University of San Carlos in Cebu, Duterte should have quit a long time ago given that her lack of experience in the education sector only worsened the working conditions of teachers and the quality of instruction for students.\n\n\"Hopefully, the next DepEd secretary is a competent replacement who is able to appropriately answer the calls for teachers' salary increase, does not antagonize teachers who campaign for their rights, and one that improves the quality of education for the students,\" Balila said.\n\nConversely, a public school teacher in Angeles City, Pampanga, said he was relieved when he learned about Duterte's resignation.\n\n\"I'm glad she resigned. It was insulting for an education secretary to refuse raising teachers' salaries while holding confidential funds. Her resignation feels like the world is finally healing,\" he said. - Herbie Gomez, John Sitchon, Dennis Jay Santos, Erwin Delilan, Joann Manabat, and Teofilo Garcia Jr./Rappler.com", "source":

Not so fast, says LP", "body": "IN BETTER TIMES President Marcos and Vice President Sara Duterte engage in small talk during the graduation rites of the Philippine Military Academy Bagong Sinag Class of 2024 in\n\nBaguio City on May 18. -- MARIANNE BERMUDEZ\n\nAfter Vice President Sara Duterte announced her resignation as education secretary, anti-Marcos and pro-Duterte forces saw her as the new leader of the opposition. Not so fast with that, Liberal Party (LP) spokesperson and former Sen. Leila de Lima said on Thursday.\n\nThe LP, which has been the main opposition party, in Congress, is \"strongly objecting\" to any such declaration, De Lima said in a statement.\n\nThe real opposition \"has a foundation of accountability, transparency and concern for the people -- which cannot be seen in VP Sara's track record\" and her resignation did not come with any change in principles, she said.\n\n\"The opposition puts the people first, not the expansion and maintenance of power; not defending wanted religious leaders or killing of thousands of Filipinos; especially not turning a blind eye on the oppression of our fishermen and foreigners stealing our territories,\" said De Lima.\n\nREAD: Sara Duterte resigns as DepEd secretary, says Palace\n\nDe Lima added that Duterte's resignation only confirmed what many people already knew -- that the unity of the UniTeam, her political alliance with President Marcos, \"was just for show.\"\n\n\"This is just a maneuver during the elections to gain support of the voters. And now it's clear that a new maneuvering is happening,\" she said.\n\nDuterte herself said as much -- that the UniTeam was only for the election campaign.\n\n\"The people need true service and care from the leaders. We call on our leaders to prioritize the Filipinos, not your personal interests,\" added De Lima.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Aquilino Pimentel III said it would be \"good for the cause of democracy to have an active, dynamic, and competent opposition segment of society.\"\n\n\"Titles are not important to me. What is more important is the quality of our democracy. There must be an opposition to check as well as 'to balance' whatever is being told to the people,\" Pimentel said in response to declarations that Duterte was the new leader of the opposition.\n\nWake-up call\n\nAccording to political science professor Jean Encinas-Franco, Duterte's break from the administration of President Marcos should serve as a wake-up call for the so-called \"real opposition\" or they will be eclipsed by the Vice President's popularity.\n\nThe University of the Philippines-Diliman professor said the longtime opposition -- which includes LP president and Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman and the Makabayan bloc in the House of Representatives -- should \"come up with creative ways on how to be more visible and more active rather than reactive.\"\n\n\"I understand that this has not been easy especially since (their numbers have been diminished) since (former President Rodrigo) Duterte's time, and both Duterte and Marcos remain very popular,\" Encinas-Franco said.\n\nShe doubted the Vice President's capability to stand as the \"real opposition\" since she had not deviated much from the Marcos administration's policies, save for a few issues.\n\nThese include Mr. Marcos' openness to rejoining the International Criminal Court (ICC) which is now investigating the Vice President's father for committing alleged crimes against humanity during the drug war and the country's assertive stance against China for its increasing aggressiveness in the West Philippine Sea.\n\nLosing momentum\n\nMore importantly, Encinas-Franco noted, Duterte had not criticized Mr. Marcos for his family's bloody legacy during the dictatorship. \"Otherwise, what's the soul of being the opposition to Marcos?\" she said.\n\nShe said also that Duterte \"seemed to lack the eloquence needed to be a good opposition leader\" and always relied on prepared speeches. Duterte's departure from the Cabinet could also \"cost her momentum\" in going around the country in the run-up to the 2028 presidential elections, according to Encinas-Franco.\n\nDuterte would lose a sizable portfolio as education secretary, a plum post that would have kept her visible throughout her term, if she had ambitions for the presidency, the professor said.\n\n\"It's a no-brainer that if you run for the vice presidency, it's not hard to predict you will run for the presidency also ... but I'm sure she must have weighed that before resigning from her post,\" she said.\n\nSolid approval rating\n\nStill, Duterte \"could be a force to be reckoned with\" in next year's midterm polls, the professor said, citing the Vice President's \"solid approval rating\" in surveys.\n\nLagman asserted that LP remained the \"ideological and conscientious opposition to both the current administration and Duterte's breakaway power bloc.\"\n\n\"The LP continues to uphold its iconic principles on good governance, participatory democracy, constitutionalism, human rights protection, and anti-authoritarian rule, all of which are not in the track record of the leaders of the now-defunct UniTeam,\" he added.\n\nKabataan Rep. Raoul Manuel of the Makabayan bloc said Duterte's so-called \"oppositionist\" stance was self-serving as \"she was opposed to the ICC investigation, opposed to seeking justice for their victims.\"\n\nManuel said Duterte's resignation could give lawmakers, during deliberations on the 2025 budget, an opportunity to finally make her explain how her office had spent millions of pesos in confidential funds after she assumed office in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "newsinfo.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "krixia_subingsubing@newsinfo.inquirer.net", "name": "Krixia Subingsubing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "tina_g_santos@newsinfo.inquirer.net", "name": "Tina G.

On Wednesday, there was little surprise when Vice President Sara Duterte tendered her resignation effective July 19 as secretary of education and co-vice chair of the controversial National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict.\n\nDuterte's departure from the Cabinet, which she announced at a press conference wherein she did not take questions, formalizes the breakup of the UniTeam. Just recently, she had said that the UniTeam was good only for the 2022 general elections, which she and President Marcos won by a landslide.\n\nMalaca\u00f1ang quickly announced that the President had accepted Duterte's resignation, which she had personally tendered to him at Malaca\u00f1ang. Duterte, who garnered more votes than Marcos in the 2022 race, said only that the 30 days before her resignation takes effect would allow for a smooth transition in the Department of Education. She also stressed that she resigned not because of \"weakness\" but out of \"compassion for teachers and students.\"\n\nTeachers' groups, which have long been at odds with Duterte, welcomed her resignation. The transition period should focus on ensuring the smooth opening of the new schoolyear, with the return to the old school calendar being fast-tracked. Critics of the Vice President and her family have always questioned her qualifications for the Department of Education, and were dismayed that political alliances became the key criteria for the selection of the DepEd chief.\n\nTwo international assessment tests have shown the seriousness of the problem besetting Philippine education, with Filipino 15-year-olds ranking at the bottom among peers from other countries in terms of mathematics, science and reading competencies.\n\nAdvanced economies have long understood the critical role played by education in national development. Early childhood learning in particular, which is under DepEd, can shape a person's prospects for advancement in life.\n\nWith the resignation of his estranged UniTeam partner, President Marcos should keep politics out of education and pick a replacement for Duterte who won't be sidetracked by political intramurals - one who can focus fully and competently on the many problems besetting this sector.

The possibilities include Sara becoming an opposition leader fielding her own slate against Marcos in the mid-term election next year and further afield, gunning for the presidency in 2028.\n\nWith her resignation, Sara is now free to position herself as an opposition figure against her erstwhile ally, said ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute fellow Dr Aries Arugay.\n\n\"Their power-sharing agreement was not feasible because of many factors, like significant policy differences. But this also has something to do with the Marcoses not being able to really give the concessions that the Dutertes thought they earned or they deserved because they helped catapult the Marcoses into power,\" he told The Straits Times.\n\nMarcos and Sara may end up endorsing different sets of candidates in next year's mid-term polls, when Filipinos vote for half of the members of the Senate and other local posts down to the village level, added Dr Arugay.\n\nSara could possibly upset Marcos' agenda in his last four years of office if more candidates allied with her win during the mid-term polls next year, political science professor Dr Jean Encinas-Franco from the University of the Philippines told ST.\n\nDuterte resigned from her posts as education secretary and vice-chair of an anti-insurgency task force, without providing a reason. Her resignation is effective July 19 and she will remain as vice-president until her term officially ends in 2028.\n\n\"My resignation was not borne out of weakness but brought about by genuine concern for our teachers and Filipino youth,\" she said in a 12-minute media briefing later in the day, where she declined to take questions.\n\n\"I may no longer be your education secretary, but I will remain as a mother - a mother watching over and fighting over the rights of every teacher and student in the Philippines. This is for a stronger Philippines,\" she added.\n\nInstead, much of the briefing was spent recounting her achievements as education chief for the past two years, including introducing new learning material to kindergarten up to junior high school levels, and providing internet access to over 2,000 schools in far-flung areas in the country.\n\nThe Marcos and Duterte families joined forces in 2022 for the presidential election, with Sara standing as Marcos' vice-presidential running mate, allowing Marcos to tap the Duterte family's huge support base and seal a comeback for the disgraced Marcos dynasty.\n\nIn the Philippines, the president and vice-president are elected separately. Hence, candidates for the two highest posts in the land may run as a team or on opposing sides.\n\nThe Philippine vice-president holds a mostly ceremonial role in the constitution but is the first in line of succession if the president dies or becomes permanently disabled. The incumbent president traditionally appoints the vice-president to the Cabinet and assigns the latter various official government functions.\n\nThus, it is not unusual in the Philippines for vice-presidents to eventually leave the Cabinet, either to distance themselves from the incumbent president's faulty policies or in a bid to rebrand themselves in anticipation of a greater political goal.\n\nSara was once the top contender in the 2022 presidential race, but gave way to Marcos and instead formed their so-called \"UniTeam\" alliance. The scions of two well-entrenched political clans in the nation swept the polls, with Marcos getting 31 million votes and Sara garnering 32 million votes.\n\nBut that alliance was quick to crumble in the aftermath of their electoral victory.\n\nMarcos began dropping key policies of his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, Sara's father, including the bloody drug war that is now being investigated by the International Criminal Court. Marcos also reversed Rodrigo Duterte's appeasement of Beijing on its sweeping claims over the South China Sea.\n\nMarcos' allies in Congress later rejected Sara's request for millions of confidential funds for the vice president's office and the education ministry this year.\n\nThe Dutertes then pushed back against Marcos, leading protests in their hometown Davao City in southern Philippines against attempts by the president to amend the constitution in early 2024. Marcos and Rodrigo even accused each other of using illegal drugs.\n\nTherefore, political pundits believe Sara's resignation as vice-president clearly signals her interest and intent for the presidential race in 2028.\n\nHowever, University of the Philippines'Franco said that Sara's resignation will place her in a more politically vulnerable position, even if she enjoys high approval ratings among Filipinos for now.\n\n\"Because she [Sara] no longer has a Cabinet portfolio, she will no longer have as much of a budget as she used to before. That will prevent her from moving around the country. Her activities will be limited,\" she added.\n\nMeanwhile, the political effect from Sara's resignation remains to be seen. In the near term, Dr Arugay at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute thinks Marcos has the upper hand, as the incumbent president.\n\n\"Expect more attacks and criticisms against the Dutertes now. As far as Marcos and his allies are concerned, she's fair game now,\" he said. - The Straits Times/ANN", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [],

DepEd and the Office of the Vice President told the media it would not entertain questions on the matter during the 30-day transition period.\n\nOn the same day, former presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said Duterte \"has just become the leader of the opposition\" and added that the UniTeam electoral partnership between her and Marcos during the 2022 elections had just been \"formally dissolved.\"\n\nDe Lima took exception to Roque's remarks, saying that the \"real opposition\" is founded on the principles of \"accountability, transparency and concern for the people,\" which the former senator said is non-existent in Duterte's track record.\n\n\"In her resignation, there was neither an acceptance of responsibility nor a change in principles and stance. How can someone who still owes accountability to the people be considered opposition?\" De Lima said in Filipino.\n\n\"Above all: The opposition prioritizes the people. Not the expansion and maintenance of power. Not defending a wanted religious leader or the killing of thousands of Filipinos. Certainly not turning a blind eye to the oppression of our fishermen and the seizure of our territory by foreigners,\" the former senator added.\n\nSimilarly, LP president Edcel Lagman, also the representative of Albay's 1st District, said Duterte may assume the role of the leader of the \"partisan opposition to the Marcos Jr. administration\" while LP remains the \"ideological and conscientious opposition to both the current administration and Duterte's breakaway power bloc.\"\n\nDe Lima said Duterte's exit from Marcos' Cabinet was merely an admission of what most already knew, \"that the 'unity' of the 'UniTeam' was only for show during elections to gain voter support.\"\n\n\"Now, it's evident that another maneuver is underway,\" De Lima said.\n\nTo recall, critics of the vice president have recently called her out for her continued silence on Chinese aggression in the West Philippine See while she has issued statements defending controversial preacher Apollo Quiboloy, a close ally of her family, among other issues.\n\nRELATED: Paolo Duterte defends Sara's silence on China aggression at WPS\n\nPolitical science professor Cleve Arguelles said these recent developments point to a showdown between the Dutertes and the Marcoses in the 2025 and 2028 elections, but the \"competition will be tough for the Dutertes\" given Marcos' resources at Malaca\u00f1ang.\n\nBut the divided administration forces -- whose rifts have been deepening since 2023 and then turned into a full-blown word war at the start of the year -- may also give the opposition an opening due to votes being divided between Marcos and Duterte, said Arguelles, who also serves as CEO of the public opinion research firm WR Numero Research.\n\nThe political science expert noted that Duterte's resignation gives her \"more time and opportunity for a pre-campaign tour\" ahead of the 2028 elections.\n\n\"Beginning yesterday too, her potential presidential campaign is now free of the baggage of whatever will happen with the Marcos administration,\" Arguelles added.\n\nA Pulse Asia survey released in April shows that Duterte and Sen. Raffy Tulfo are statistically tied among potential presidential candidates in the 2028 elections.\n\nMeanwhile, Duterte remains Filipinos' top choice for president in a WR Numero poll released in March.\n\nArguelles said in January that public services and programs meant for marginalized Filipinos may be \"hijacked\" by political forces to capture supporters amid the spat between the Marcoses and the Dutertes.", "source": {"uri": "philstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Philstar.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cristina_chi@philstar.com", "name": "Cristina Chi", "type": "author",

Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, an ally of Vice President Sara Duterte, was demoted from House senior deputy speaker to deputy speaker.\n\nSara resigned from the Romualdez-led Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats party after Arroyo's demotion.\n\nRumors of a rift among UniTeam members intensified after the House of Representatives, dominated by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s allies, realigned the combined P650-million confidential funds of the Office of the Vice President and Department of Education to agencies securing the West Philippine Sea.\n\nThe House lawmakers' decision to strip the agencies led by Sara of intelligence funds angered her father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, who labeled the legislative chamber as the \"most rotten\" institution and accused Speaker Martin Romualdez of \"swallowing\" discretionary funds.\n\nHouse members denied the accusation and approved a resolution affirming the chamber's honor and integrity. Two Duterte allies who did not sign the resolution - Arroyo and Davao City Rep. Isidro Ungab - lost their posts as deputy speakers.\n\nThings turned personal last January when Duterte claimed in an expletive-laden speech in Davao that Marcos is a drug addict, an allegation that the Marcos just laughed off.\n\nDuterte also warned Marcos that the attempt of some administration allies to effect Charter change through a people's initiative signature campaign could lead to his ouster, similar to the fate of the president's late father and namesake in 1986. Marcos responded by linking Duterte's tirades to his use of the highly addictive drug fentanyl.\n\nDespite the word war, Marcos claimed that the UniTeam was still intact and \"vibrant.\"\n\nIn April, the political landscape took a surprising turn when First Lady Liza Marcos disclosed that she has come to view Sara negatively because the vice president laughed when her father was calling Marcos \"bangag\" or high on drugs during a rally in Davao City. Sara responded by saying that Liza's personal feelings had nothing to do with her functions in the government.\n\nMarcos had also defended Sara from critics calling for her removal from the Cabinet, saying the issue did not affect his working relations with his runningmate in the 2022 elections.\n\nSara made headlines this month when she said that the UniTeam had already served its purpose.\n\n\"The UniTeam was a tandem during the 2022 elections. The elections are over, we won and we are grateful to those who supported us,\" she said during the 126th Independence Day celebration in Davao City last June 12.", "source": {"uri": "philstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Philstar.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "edith_regalado@philstar.com", "name": "Edith Regalado", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "neil_jayson_servallos@philstar.com", "name": "Neil Jayson Servallos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UniTeam_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UniTeam Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Marcos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ferdinand Marcos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_Duterte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo Duterte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Macapagal_Arroyo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gloria Macapagal Arroyo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Duterte", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sara Duterte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakas\u2013CMD", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lakas\u2013CMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_(Philippines)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Department of Education (Philippines)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Representatives of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davao_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Davao City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Davao City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pampanga", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pampanga"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pampanga"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Speaker_of_the_House_of_Representatives_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Philippine_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Philippine Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Romualdez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martin Romualdez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidro_Ungab", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isidro Ungab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Representatives_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Philippine_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 Philippine presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fentanyl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://media.philstar.com/photos/2024/06/20/uniteam_2024-06-20_08-42-41.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664054", "eventUri": "eng-9664054", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 2654, "textEnd": 2661}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Someone familiar with how the department works as well as with the problems of the education sector and educational system. Someone who has dedicated his or her life to education and can show the track record for it,\" Pimentel pointed out.\n\nHe declined to comment on Duterte's future political plans.\n\n\"Whatever her reason may be for resigning as DepEd secretary, I believe that it was well thought of. I believe it was a choice that took into consideration the best interest of our people, as has always been characteristic of her. Of that I am sure,\" Sen. Ronald dela Rosa said.\n\nHe assured Duterte of his support in \"whatever future decisions she is going to make to better serve the country, regardless of function and position.\"\n\nEducation crisis\n\nIn the Lower House, opposition lawmakers welcomed Duterte's resignation, saying the move could lead to the solution of the country's education crisis and that it \"absolutely terminated\" the UniTeam, referring to the alliance between the Dutertes and the Marcoses during the 2022 presidential election.\n\nIn a statement, House Deputy Minority Leader and ACT Teachers party list Rep. France Castro said the resignation should have come sooner as the country's education crisis could have been solved in the more than two years the Vice President held the post.\n\n\"In resigning her post from the [National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict] we hope that the Red-tagging agency would also be abolished. It is nothing but an apparatus of the state to violate human rights and spread fake news,\" she added.\n\nThe resignation of Duterte \"also marks the open war between the former allies and the upcoming escalation of hostilities between the two camps,\" she warned, urging President Marcos to immediately appoint a secretary from the education sector.\n\nAlbay Rep. Edcel Lagman agreed that Duterte's resignation \"will hopefully lead to the solution of the alarming crisis in Philippine education.\"\n\n'A liability'\n\nLagman cited Duterte's statement that she was resigning out of genuine concern for teachers and the Filipino youth, claiming that it meant \"her incumbency was a liability to teachers and students.\"\n\n\"It is hoped that her replacement will come from the ranks of experienced and dedicated educators who can efficiently steer and professionally manage the educational system of the country,\" he said.\n\nThe lawmaker, who is president of the Liberal Party, also noted that Duterte's departure from a prime position in the President's Cabinet \"ends with finality the increasingly tenuous partisan relations between the Duterte and Marcos political power blocs,\" and \"this terminates absolutely the UniTeam.\"\n\nMeanwhile, House Assistant Minority Leader and Gabriela Women's party Rep. Arlene Brosas described the resignation as a \"political move\" in preparation for next year's elections, setting the stage for a potential \"power struggle between the Duterte and Marcos factions.\"\n\nBrosas said that from the very start, the Vice President had \"no real intention of addressing the crisis in our education system,\" pointing out that her appointment \"reeked of traditional political maneuverings rather than a sincere commitment to improve our schools and protect our teachers and students.\"\n\nTask Force cites gains\n\nMeanwhile, the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-Elcac) said it respects the decision of Duterte to resign from her role as vice chair of the task force.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the NTF-Elcac lauded Duterte's tenure in the task force as being \"marked by significant progress\" in efforts to address the root causes of insurgency and promote sustainable peace in conflict-affected areas.\n\n\"Her leadership and unwavering commitment to the mission of NTF-Elcac have been instrumental in advancing our collective goal of achieving lasting peace and development in the Philippines,\" said Undersecretary Ernesto Torres Jr., NTF-Elcac executive director.\n\nTorres added that Duterte's dedication to the task force resulted in numerous successful initiatives and operations that \"have strengthened the resolve and capacity of our communities to stand against insurgency.\"\n\n\"Her leadership has also emphasized the importance of education as a vital component in combating insurgency,\" he noted.\n\nAccording to Torres, the NTF-Elcac will ensure a seamless transition and remain focused on its mandate to end local communist armed conflict in the country. -- with a report from Nestor Corrales", "source": {"uri": "newsinfo.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeannette_i_andrade@newsinfo.inquirer.net", "name": "Jeannette I.

Duterte said she planed to lay down a 30-day transition plan for a smooth and orderly turnover of her duties in the offices she used to head. No reason for her irrevocable resignation was given in her letter addressed to President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr.\n\nUpon hearing the news, I asked a fellow historian, Dr. Efren Isorena, to join me as a guest in my radio talk show at DZRJ 810 AM to discuss Duterte's resignation from the Marcos administration.\n\nIsorena saw the resignation as undeniable proof that the so-called UniTeam of the May 9, 2022 elections is finished; Sara herself said on June 12, 2024 that the UniTeam was only created for the elections and hinted that since they are \"not candidates anymore,\" the Marcos-Duterte tandem also ceased to exist. This was inevitable, said Isorena, pointing to the looming International Criminal Court (ICC) action against Sara's father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, and a series of Rodrigo-led \"Hakbang ng Maisug\" rallies, where anti-Marcos statements were hurled by members of the Duterte family.\n\nI have written extensively about signs that it was the Marcos camp which actively sought to dissolve their alliance with the Dutertes. To be sure, Rodrigo started the fireworks when he was still president, and Bongbong and Sara emerged as a tandem for the May 9, 2022 elections, suggesting that the then-presidential candidate had issues with narcotics and that his character was essentially weak. However, not much was said after that and Rodrigo pretty much stayed away from the limelight after his term of office ended on June 30, 2022. Nevertheless, during the first two years of the Marcos presidency, the ICC issue never really went away, suggesting that it was being used by the new administration as a sort of \"sword of Damocles\" hanging over the head of Rodrigo.\n\nFrom the election season of 2022 -- beginning with the filing of the certificate of candidacy -- Sara has habitually washed her hands of the statements of her father and other family members, reiterating on many occasions her fidelity first to the UniTeam during the elections and to the Marcos administration, where she was appointed secretary of education. I remember pro-UniTeam social media personalities emphasizing the fact that Sara never attacked Marcos, and was in fact tireless in campaigning for the tandem. As a member of the Marcos administration, Sara was also quick to deflect the actions of her father and siblings when the Marcos-Duterte alliance was beginning to show signs of fraying at the seams, causing untold frustration among the ranks of Duterte supporters who felt that Marcos was using the weight of the state apparatuses to run after Rodrigo and surrogates, particularly the controversial Pastor Apollo Quiboloy.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nIsorena added that aside from the threat of the ICC, the Marcos camp tried to revive the issue of the extrajudicial killings related to the Duterte administration's infamous war on drugs, as well as the supposed \"secret\" agreement with China concerning the West Philippine Sea as ammunition against the Dutertes. Isorena and I both forgot to mention on air the attack leveled by Marcos allies in the legislature against Sara concerning the so-called confidential funds.\n\nIsorena and I, however, agreed that the break between Bongbong and Sara was inevitable, especially when we look at historical trends. For context, the 1987 Constitution -- and the 1935 Constitution before that -- allowed for a separate democratic mandate for the president and the vice president. In fact, on many instances, especially after 1986, the president and vice president belonged to different tandems during the elections. As the end of their terms approached, and elections loomed on the horizon, the president becomes absorbed with promoting his or her chosen successor. The vice president, on the other hand, frequently emerges as a candidate for the presidency, often in a different tandem from the one supported by the president, leading to the inevitable break. This happened with then-president Corazon Aquino and then-vice president Salvador Laurel in 1992; Fidel Ramos and Joseph Estrada in 1998; Estrada and Gloria Arroyo during the former's impeachment in 2001; Arroyo and Teofisto Guingona Jr. in 2004. Surprisingly, it did not happen with Arroyo and then-vice president Manuel de Castro in 2010; Benigno Aquino III and Jejomar Binay in 2016; and Rodrigo Duterte and Ma. Leonor Robredo in 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, in this particular cycle, the break came earlier than usual. Isorena and I noticed that, usually, the split occurs after the midterm elections or toward the next presidential elections. Why did the Marcos-Duterte break happen before the 2025 midterm elections?\n\nLastly, we talked about the implications of the Marcos-Duterte break for the 2025 midterm elections. I asserted that it will have very little impact on local politics. However, because of the Dutertes' massive influence in Mindanao and the Visayas, most senatorial candidates in 2025 would probably not openly side with Marcos versus the Dutertes. On the other hand, with Marcos as the incumbent president, senatorial candidates would also not want to be identified with the Dutertes.\n\nI predict a repeat of the midterm elections during the presidency of Aquino III, where senatoriables joined both (!) the administration and opposition slates as \"guest candidates.\" Isorena maintains that the Duterte camp will be pressed to field candidates -- not necessarily a complete 12-member slate -- who can perform strongly in the midterm elections to maintain the image of popular support behind them. The Marcos camp shall also be pressured to perform well in these midterms for the same reason, making it one of the most interesting non-presidential elections since 2001 after the Estrada impeachment.", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "van_ybiernas@manilatimes.net", "name": "Van Ybiernas", "type": "author",

Panelo also acted as his spokesman for the portion of the Duterte administration.\n\nPanelo said the Vice President's resignation from the Cabinet was forthcoming given the hostile environment that she found herself in, ''created by the allies of PBBM who were in a hurry to diminish and dislodge her enviable leading spot in the 2028 presidential race.''\n\nPanelo claimed that the supposed ominous omission by Marcos to defend her on various issues ''added to her discomfort.''\n\nThe lawyer also mentioned First Lady Louise ''Liza'' Araneta-Marcos' rift with the Vice President, saying that the former's public disclosure of her displeasure on a perceived but misplaced slight reinforced the suffocating atmosphere.\n\n''As a principled individual with a high sense of delicadeza, she was caged and chained -- divesting her of the freedom to express herself on government policies not in sync with her convictions without embarrassing the present dispensation,'' Panelo

Duterte is poised to build his own coalition critical of the Marcos government.\n\nCritics on Thursday rejected proposals to make his daughter Vice-President Sara Duterte-Carpio, who on Wednesday resigned from the Marcos Cabinet, the face of the opposition.\n\n\"Based on previous surveys, there's a sizable population not aligned to any of them,\" Hansley A. Juliano, who teaches political science at Ateneo de Manila University, said in a Facebook Messenger chat.\n\n\"Instead of trying to preach to the opposition choir or convince hardline Marcos or Duterte supporters, it's best for the traditional opposition to stick to capturing undecided voters,\" he added.\n\nSenator Risa Hontiveros-Baraquel is the highest elected official among opposition personalities, leading Senate investigations of various corruption and human rights issues hounding the government, including the case of religious leader Apollo C. Quiboloy, who is a close friend of the Duterte family.\n\nThe Liberal Party (LP), which supports her, said Ms. Duterte-Carpio \"might assume the leadership of the partisan opposition\" but it remains \"the ideological and conscientious opposition to both the current administration and Duterte's breakaway power bloc.\"\n\n\"LP continues to uphold its iconic principles on good governance, participatory democracy, constitutionalism, human rights protection and anti-authoritarian rule, all of which are not in the track record of the leaders of the now-defunct UniTeam,\" President and Albay Rep. Edcel C. Lagman said in a statement.\n\nBagong Alyansang Makabayan, another traditional opposition group, urged Filipinos to \"reject the rottenness of the current political system that is marred by factional infighting, corruption and self-serving agendas.\"\n\n\"The ruling system continues to crumble under the weight of its own moribund crisis,\" it said in a separate statement. \"Genuine change will not come from these elite factions but from the collective struggle of the people.\"\n\nMr. Juliano said a three-way fight is likely in the 2025 midterm polls, with the Duterte camp likely projecting itself as an opposition force.\n\nHakbang Maisug, a movement supposedly created by Mr. Duterte and his allies to oppose the government's push for constitutional amendments, urged Ms. Duterte-Carpio to lead them in their \"struggle for transparency, accountability, peace and security.\"\n\nMr. Marcos and Ms. Duterte-Carpio campaigned on a platform of unity in 2022, but critics say it was just a marriage of convenience.\n\n'OPPORTUNITY'\n\nCracks within the ruling coalition became more apparent after the House of Representatives led by Speaker Ferdinand Martin G. Romualdez, a cousin of Mr. Marcos, last year denied Ms. Duterte-Carpio's request for confidential funds under the 2024 national budget.\n\nMs. Duterte- Carpio, who was appointed vice-chairperson of the anti-communist task force in May last year, was among the first to hit the government's attempt to pursue peace talks with Maoist rebels, calling it \"an agreement with the devil.\"\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) is investigating her father and Mr. Marcos' predecessor, Rodrigo R. Duterte, for his deadly war on drugs.\n\nMr. Marcos had said his government was studying the possibility of rejoining the ICC after an exit in 2019, although he has opposed the ICC probe, which he sees as an affront to Philippine sovereignty.\n\nMr. Duterte, who has accused Mr. Marcos of being a drug addict, has been active in rallies calling for his resignation. Mr. Marcos has fired back by linking his predecessor's drug accusations against him to his fentanyl use.\n\n\"Measuring which among the House members, and by extension the local government officials they represent, are on the side of Marcos-Romualdez is going to be a key consideration in the leadup to 2025 and after,\" Mr. Juliano said.\n\nThe President's Partido Federal ng Pilipinas party has allied itself with Mr. Romualdez's Lakas CMD and the Nacionalista Party ahead of the 2025 midterm elections.\n\nMr. Marcos has veered away from, if not totally reversed, some of Mr. Duterte's key policies including pursuing closer security ties with the United States away from China.\n\n\"As for the old opposition, the Marcos-Duterte split is an opportunity, if and only if they want to and can actually project loyal opposition that can resonate with more moderate partisans from the Marcos camp,\" said Anthony Lawrence Borja, a political science professor at De La Salle University.\n\n\"If not, then they will remain with their current base and the probability of their success will be proportional to public discontent towards both the factions of Marcos and Duterte,\" he said via Messenger chat.\n\nBased on Octa Research's poll in March, the trust rating of Mr. Marcos declined by six points to 69% from December. Ms. Duterte-Carpio's rating also fell by nine points to 68%.\n\nMr. Borja said new middle forces might emerge in the leadup to the 2025 elections \"but it might be under the growing trend of independent and shared candidates who can dance between the triad of Marcos, Duterte and the old liberal opposition.\"", "source": {"uri": "bworldonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

students.\"\n\nShe and Marcos both ran under the \"Uniteam\" electoral alliance for the 2022 national elections with the platform banked on \"unity\" as key to recovering from the crisis brought by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMarcos previously said Duterte wanted to head the Department of National Defense, citing the latter's comments about security and terrorism.\n\nShe later said she had

Lawmakers on Sara Duterte's resignation as DepEd chief", "body": "MANILA, Philippines - Several lawmakers on Wednesday, June 19, weighed in on the decision of Vice President Sara Duterte to resign as secretary of the Department of Education (DepEd) and ultimately, from the cabinet of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., calling the move either \"long overdue\" or \"regrettable.\"\n\nFor Gabriela Representative Arlene Brosas, Duterte's resignation as education secretary is \"long overdue,\" as the country needs an experienced \"genuine public servant\" to lead the government agency.\n\n\"From the very start, the Vice President had no real intention of addressing the crisis in our education system,\" the teacher-lawmaker said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"Her controversial appointment reeked of traditional political maneuverings rather than a sincere commitment to improve our schools and protect our teachers and students,\" she added.\n\nDuterte's appointment as education secretary in 2022 drew criticism from those in the education sector who cited her lack of experience in addressing critical sectoral issues. The country is still grappling with the effects of the pandemic, among them a learning crisis. (READ: History in crisis)\n\nACT Teachers Representative France Castro said the education sector lost two years - the period of Duterte's stint at DepEd - in addressing its problems.\n\n\"Nasayang ang dalawang taon para ayusin agad ang education crisis sa bansa at benepisyo at sahod ng mga guro at education support personnel,\" Castro said.\n\n(Two years were wasted instead of immediately fixing the country's education crisis, and the benefits and salaries of our teachers and education support personnel.)\n\nThe Vice President did not elaborate much on her decision to step down from DepEd as well as from her duties as vice chairperson of the country's National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC). She, however, said this should not be seen as a sign weakness but because of her \"genuine concern for our teachers and the Filipino youth.\"\n\nAlbay 1st District Representative Edcel Lagman noted how Duterte herself admitted that \"her incumbency was a liability to teachers and students.\"\n\n\"It is hoped that her replacement will come from the ranks of experienced and dedicated educators who can efficiently steer and professionally manage the educational system of the country,\" said Lagman, who is also Liberal Party president.\n\nSenator Sherwin Gatchalian, who chairs the Senate committee on basic education, expressed regret over Duterte's decision to leave the DepEd, citing the work that the committee and DepEd had jointly done to improve the country's education system.\n\n\"Marami kaming ongoing joint programs and activities at ang edcom ay nakikipagcoordinate para maiayos ang problema sa education system. Nanghihinayang lang ako,\" he said, when asked about his reaction to Duterte's resignation.\n\n(We have many ongoing joint programs and activities and the education committee coordinates [with DepEd] to fix the problems in the education system. It's regrettable.)\n\nSenator Chiz Escudero said that he respects that he called Duterte's \"inevitable\" resignation from the Marcos Cabinet.\n\n\"I believe her resignation was inevitable from the time her father, FPRRD, and her siblings and allies started attacking PBBM and members of the First family. Its inevitability became more pronounced when she was already silent and not expressing her support on certain policy issues such as the West Philippine Sea, the Bagong Pilipinas Hymn, the Quiboloy cases and attempted arrest, etc.,\" Escudero said.\n\n\"As the Vice President, she has every right to have policy differences with the President and I believe that people love and respect her precisely for that...for having and fighting for what she believes in and for her own beliefs. I wish her well in this, her new journey as she continues to serve our people as our Vice President,\" Escudero added.\n\nSenator Imee Marcos, for her part, vowed to continue to be Duterte's staunch ally.\n\nDuterte's resignation from her posts can also be viewed as a political move, especially as the midterm polls are right around the corner.\n\nThe power struggle between the Marcos and Duterte clans have been prominent since late 2023, with calls for the Vice President to resign from Marcos' cabinet popping after after a word war between the two families in early in 2024.\n\n\"Duterte's departure from a prime position in the President's Cabinet ends with finality the increasingly tenuous partisan relations between the Duterte and Marcos political power blocs,\" Lagman said. \"This terminates absolutely the Uniteam.\"\n\nPolitical analysts have earlier warned that the Dutertes may be posturing themselves as the new opposition or the underdog. For instance, the House of Representatives has begun looking into legacies of the Duterte administration, including an investigation on the bloody war on drugs.\n\nBrosas, however, reminded the public to stay vigilant. \"They remain united in pushing anti-people policies and governance that favor only their dynastic interests at the expense of the Filipino people.\" - Rappler.com", "source":

Such a person, he said, would \"understand the problems of the public school system.\"\n\nHe said Duterte's stance or silence on many controversial issues hounding the country was disappointing, given that she was DepEd secretary.\n\nWhile DepEd was parroting the message, \"We dream of Filipinos who passionately love their country,\" under Duterte, the Vice President kept mum over China's actions against Filipinos at the West Philippine Sea (WPS).\n\nWorse, Gelangre said, was Duterte's consistent defense of fugitive Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC) leader Apollo Quiboloy, who is wanted in connection with cases of child abuse and human trafficking.\n\nHe noted that the Vice President once described the investigation into the alleged abuses of Quiboloy and his group as \"unfair,\" \"trial by publicity,\" and criticized the police about the way they tried to catch the fugitive preacher in Davao City.\n\nGelangre said Duterte's position on Quiboloy was inconsistent with DepEd's mission on child protection.\n\nHe also said the unexplained spending of P125 million in intelligence funds in just 11 days in 2022 has continued to hound the Vice President to this day.\n\n\"This is totally against DepEd's policy, which is honesty is the best policy,\" Gelangre said.\n\nMeanwhile, Human Rights Advocates Negros (HRAN) said Duterte's resignation from the cabinet and as vice chair of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) signaled an intensification of the factional strife in the Marcos Jr. administration.\n\n\"We can only surmise that the conflict between the Marcos and Duterte factions will intensify from hereon, from the State of the Nation Address (SONA) to the 2025 midterm elections. But while the two reactionary factions of the ruling elite slug it out well before the mid-term elections, the people are still reeling from severe economic and political crises,\" read part of the statement of the Negros-based human rights watchdog.\n\nFormer Negros Occidental governor Rafael Coscolluela said Duterte apparently has new plans that could mean more political discord.\n\n\"But what really matters now is finding an education secretary who can transform DepEd and effectively address our education crisis,\" Coscolluela said. -

Marcos, Jr., according to the presidential palace, ending two years of political partnership with the Marcoses.\n\nShe would no longer serve as Education secretary and as vice chairperson of the government's anti-communist task force effective July 19, Presidential Communications Office Secretary Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil said in a statement.\n\nShe did not say why she resigned, Ms. Garafil said, adding that the President had accepted her decision. \"We thank her for her service.\"\n\nMr. Marcos and Ms. Duterte-Carpio ran in tandem in the 2022 elections and won.\n\nIn the Philippines, the president and vice-president are elected separately and may come from opposing political parties. The Vice-President usually becomes powerless unless the President gives him a key post in his Cabinet.\n\nIn a speech shortly after the palace announcement, Ms. Duterte-Carpio said she met with the President earlier in the day to file her resignation. She added that she gave him a 30-day notice to ensure an orderly transition.\n\n\"My resignation is not a sign of weakness but was brought by genuine concern for our teachers and the Filipino youth,\" she said in Filipino. \"We will continue to promote the quality of education that Filipinos deserve.\"\n\nMr. Marcos and Ms. Duterte-Carpio campaigned on a platform of unity and reconciliation.\n\n\"UniTeam as a team was formed out of convenience,\" Jan Robert R. Go, a political science professor at the University of the Philippines, said in a Facebook Messenger chat. \"The resignation is only indicative of the fragile coalition that they had. That's the final nail in the UniTeam's coffin.\"\n\nCracks within the ruling coalition became more apparent after the House of Representatives last year denied Ms. Duterte-Carpio's request for confidential funds under the 2024 national budget.\n\nMs. Duterte-Carpio, who was appointed vice-chairperson of the anti-communist task force in May last year, was among the first to hit the government's attempt to pursue peace talks with Maoist rebels, calling it \"an agreement with the devil.\"\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) is investigating her father and Mr. Marcos' predecessor Rodrigo R. Duterte for his deadly war on drugs.\n\nMr. Marcos had said his government was studying the possibility of rejoining the ICC after an exit in 2019, although he has opposed the ICC probe, which he sees as an affront to Philippine sovereignty.\n\nMr. Marcos has veered away from, if not totally reversed, some of Mr. Duterte's key policies, including pursuing closer security ties with the United States away from China.\n\nMr. Duterte in January accused Mr. Marcos of being a drug addict, a claim that Mr. Marcos attributed to Mr. Duterte's fentanyl use.\n\nMaria Ela L. Atienza, who teaches political science at UP, said Ms. Duterte's resignation from the Marcos Cabinet was \"long overdue.\"\n\n\"Finally, the fa\u00e7ade or formality of unity is [gone] and both camps can freely attack each other,\" she said in a Viber message. \"After all, Philippine politics is dominated by political dynasties and factions supporting them and not political parties.\"\n\nMs. Duterte-Carpio left the Department of Education (DepEd) in a poor state, with groups criticizing the agency's poor performance in handling the education crisis brought by lockdowns under a global coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Philippines ranked 77 among 81 countries in the 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), with Filipino students aged 15 lagging in math, reading and science.\n\nIn a recent report on PISA 2022, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on Tuesday said 15-year-old Filipino students ranked 63 out of 64 countries in terms of creative thinking.\n\nHansley A. Juliano, who teaches political science at the Ateneo de Manila University, said in a Facebook Messenger chat that Ms. Duterte-Carpio might be \"running away\" from the potential consequences of her DepEd leadership.\n\n\"Ms. Duterte tried to cling to her position, knowing how instrumental DepEd is for political control as well as for her future political plans,\" said Arjan P. Aguirre, a political science professor at the Ateneo.\n\n\"Expect her to be more aggressive for the midterm elections,\" he said via Messenger chat.\n\nThe political parties of Mr. Marcos and his cousin Speaker Ferdinand Martin G. Romualdez have built a coalition with two other parties ahead of the 2025 midterm elections for a full Senate slate.\n\nMs. Duterte-Carpio's regional party, Hugpong ng Pagbabago, is not part of the new coalition, although Mr. Romualdez has said their group was open to an alliance with the Mindanao-based group.\n\n\"As the midterm elections come closer, Sara is probably consolidating her position and support to build up for her possible presidential bid,\" Mr. Go said.\n\nHe said Mr. Marcos now has \"greater leeway\" to act without considering the sensibilities of the Dutertes \"and even directly confront them when necessary.\" \"In the end, the losers are the people who are mere spectators of this political elite's bickering.\"", "source": {"uri": "bworldonline.com", "dataType":

In Philippine politics, loyalties often shift whenever elections are approaching and more so when the dust settles.\n\n\"There's uncertainty surrounding the loyalties within Bongbong Marcos' slate. The political allegiance of those rallying behind the administration's candidates beyond the midterms is far from guaranteed,\" he explained.\n\nLlamas further noted the uniqueness of the current political environment, marked by high-stakes maneuvering between the Duterte and Marcos camps.\n\nThis unprecedented level of involvement by two powerhouse political families, coupled with international pressures such as those from the International Criminal Court (ICC), adds layers of complexity to the situation.\n\nWhen questioned about whether Duterte's resignation could boost her or her party's approval ratings, Llamas expressed skepticism.\n\nHe suggested that any potential benefits would depend on whether the Vice President can use this opportunity to strengthen both her organizational leadership and the coherence of her political message.\n\n\"For this resignation to be advantageous, Sara would need to consolidate not only her leadership base but also the narrative of the Duterte camp. Often, their messages have been contradictory, with differing statements from her father, spokesperson Harry Roque, and herself,\" Llamas observed.\n\nHe added, \"If Sara can lead effectively and unify both their base and their messaging, it could indeed turn into a positive development. However, managing her father's influence remains a significant challenge.\"\n\nA recent OCTA Research survey conducted from March 24-27, 2024, revealed a significant drop in her popularity: trust ratings fell to 68 percent, down from 77 percent in December 2023, while approval ratings decreased to 64 percent, an 11 percent drop.", "source": {"uri": "manilastandard.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manila Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_Duterte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo Duterte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Task_Force_to_End_Local_Communist_Armed_Conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Duterte", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sara Duterte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_(Philippines)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Department of Education (Philippines)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benigno_Aquino_III", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benigno Aquino III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senate of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Marcos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ferdinand Marcos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bongbong_Marcos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bongbong Marcos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the Philippines"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social exclusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCTA_Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OCTA Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Roque", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Roque"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Political_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Political Science", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Tests_and_Quizzes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Tests and Quizzes", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://cdn.manilastandard.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/uniteam_marcos_sara.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664054", "eventUri": "eng-9664054", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 491, "textEnd": 498}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-24", "textStart": 2828, "textEnd": 2836}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Over. Kaput. The eagle from the south and the lion from the north are taking opposite routes, making a head-on collision inevitable.\n\nThe implosion was bound to happen. The only question was who between President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. and Vice President Sara Duterte wanted, to quote a line from a Gladys Knight and the Pips hit, \"to be the first to say goodbye.\"\n\nIt turned out to be Duterte. But just as noteworthy as the vice president's decisiveness in submitting her resignation from the Cabinet was the swiftness with which Marcos accepted it. Both anticipated or even wanted the divorce and were prepared to move on.\n\nThe dissolution of this marriage of political convenience will have a huge impact on local politics, particularly in Cebu. Politicians with an eye on the 2025 midterm elections will have to make a choice sooner than later. Gov. Gwendolyn Garcia deserves praise for making hers before the breakup was formalized. She has chosen Marcos.\n\nMayor Michael Rama with whom the governor is feuding tried to play both sides by continuing to profess his loyalty to the president even after he attended a rally for former president Rodrigo Duterte in Cebu. Judging from what he said when he was preventively suspended, Rama may have already made up his mind to ally with Duterte.\n\nBut of course. His choices are limited. The Marcos camp is now too small for him and Garcia so that is no longer an option for him. On the other hand, the overcrowded field of mayoral aspirants in Cebu City demands that he moves fast to get Duterte's endorsement before others beat him to it.\n\nDuterte's support would be ironic if you recall how he maltreated Rama in the past. Duterte accused him of being a drug coddler and initially rebuffed his efforts to see the president so he could personally give his side.\n\nBut one cannot hold grudges in perpetuity especially in politics. Duterte and Rama need each other now, more than ever. The tough-talking former president has thousands of admirers in Cebu and he has that uncanny ability to make winners of candidates with limited chances. Think Bong Go. Think Bato dela Rosa.\n\nRama is definitely easier to sell than the above-named senators. In fact, he could probably pull it off on his own. He has proven that in past elections. His suspension may have taken out his access to the city government's enormous resources but it also gave him a vast opportunity to appeal to the emotion of the voters. They threw me out of City Hall straight into the arms of my people. How does that sound coming from someone like Mike Rama?\n\nStill, he is a wise candidate who believes in accumulating all plus factors for his candidacy. A Duterte endorsement is definitely a plus and it would do Rama well to strike a deal with the former, if he hasn't yet.", "source": {"uri": "sunstar.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sun.Star Network Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frank_malilong@sunstar.com.ph", "name": "Frank Malilong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bongbong_Marcos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bongbong Marcos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_Duterte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo Duterte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cebu", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cebu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cebu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UniTeam_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UniTeam Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Duterte", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sara Duterte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwendolyn_Garcia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gwendolyn Garcia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladys_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gladys Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midterm_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midterm election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Rama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cebu_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cebu City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cebu City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bong_Go", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bong Go"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_dela_Rosa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronald dela Rosa"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/sunstar%2F2024-05%2F13afd98e-dd2d-44a4-9c58-6170c62da713%2FSunStar%20Malilong?rect=0%2C28%2C750%2C394&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664054", "eventUri": "eng-9664054", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Such a person, he said, would \"understand the problems of the public school system.\"\n\nHe said Duterte's stance or silence on many controversial issues hounding the country was disappointing, given that she was DepEd secretary.\n\nWhile DepEd was parroting the message, \"We dream of Filipinos who passionately love their country,\" under Duterte, the Vice President kept mum over China's actions against Filipinos at the West Philippine Sea (WPS).\n\nWorse, Gelangre said, was Duterte's consistent defense of fugitive Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC) leader Apollo Quiboloy, who is wanted in connection with cases of child abuse and human trafficking.\n\nHe noted that the Vice President once described the investigation into the alleged abuses of Quiboloy and his group as \"unfair,\" \"trial by publicity,\" and criticized the police about the way they tried to catch the fugitive preacher in Davao City.\n\nGelangre said Duterte's position on Quiboloy was inconsistent with DepEd's mission on child protection.\n\nHe also said the unexplained spending of P125 million in intelligence funds in just 11 days in 2022 has continued to hound the Vice President to this day.\n\n\"This is totally against DepEd's policy, which is honesty is the best policy,\" Gelangre said.\n\nMeanwhile, Human Rights Advocates Negros (HRAN) said Duterte's resignation from the cabinet and as vice chair of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) signaled an intensification of the factional strife in the Marcos Jr. administration.\n\n\"We can only surmise that the conflict between the Marcos and Duterte factions will intensify from hereon, from the State of the Nation Address (SONA) to the 2025 midterm elections.

She will continue to serve as Vice-President.\u201d\n\nFollowing the palace statement, Duterte-Carpio held a press conference where she extolled her accomplishments as education secretary \u2013 such as improving the basic education infrastructure, launching a new curriculum, and improving teachers\u2019 welfare \u2013 but gave no specific reason for stepping down from her roles.\n\n\u201cMy countrymen, my resignation is not due to weak resolve, but it is brought on by my genuine care for teachers and the Filipino youth,\u201d she said.\n\nHer departure from the cabinet came a week after she told reporters inquiring about her no-show at various palace functions, \u201cWe are not candidates any more.\u201d\n\nShe explained that the \u201cBongbong-Sara Uniteam\u201d, as they called themselves when they campaigned in the 2022 presidential election, was only a political \u201ctandem\u201d to get both elected.\n\nIt also occurred two months after the president\u2019s wife, first lady Louise \u201cLiza\u201d Araneta-Marcos, said she had purposely snubbed Duterte-Carpio during a send-off for a foreign trip by cabinet officials because the latter had \u201ccrossed the line\u201d by laughing during a rally when former president Duterte called Marcos Jnr a drug addict.\n\nAnalysts told This Week in Asia that both Marcos Jnr and Duterte-Carpio had long politically separated and this merely formalised it.\n\n\u201cThis was long overdue,\u201d former congressman Barry Gutierrez told This Week in Asia on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWhen her father, brothers, and allies started attacking the administration at the start of the year, it was clear that the alliance had collapsed,\u201d said Gutierrez, who was spokesman for former vice-president Leni Robredo.\n\n\u201cBut she held on for the advantage of heading an executive department,\u201d he added, referring to Duterte-Carpio\u2019s positions as vice-president and education secretary that meant she had access to billions of pesos in funding.\n\nPolitical risk analyst Ronald Llamas said the split was \u201clong overdue\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have been saying that for one year. She just formalised her untenable and unsustainable situation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMaybe she realised, although belatedly, that being in the official family of the president while all her political allies and family [members] are throwing everything at the government and the president \u2013 even the kitchen sink \u2013 that this is costing her more than it\u2019s benefiting her.\u201d\n\nFormer Senator Antonio Trillanes IV said the resignation was \u201cabout time\u201d, noting that \u201ca more principled public servant would have done it earlier\u201d.\n\nDuterte-Carpio\u2019s resignation marks a political turning point for the Marcos Jnr government \u2013 one that analysts say is not wholly in his favour.\n\n\u201cThe fact that she\u2019s leaving now means they [the Duterte family] have something else lined up,\u201d Llamas said.\n\nTrillanes agreed, telling This Week in Asia that the Dutertes \u201cwill oust BBM [Marcos Jnr\u2019s initials] whenever they get a chance\u201d.\n\nAs the vice-president, Duterte-Carpio is next in the succession line if the presidency becomes vacant. Should this happen after June 30, Llamas had said in an earlier interview with This Week in Asia that Duterte-Carpio could serve the rest of Marcos Jnr\u2019s unfinished term and then run for a new six-year term as president come 2028.\n\nGutierrez said her departure from his cabinet would in a sense make governing for Marcos Jnr more difficult. \u201cYou can now expect the Dutertes to go all out against him. No more pretence at \u2018unity\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt also puts Marcos Jnr in a position where he has to decide if he will likewise pull no punches against the Dutertes. He is the president, he has more moves, the ICC [International Criminal Court] case being one of the strongest,\u201d Gutierrez added.\n\nHe was referring to the alleged crimes against humanity case filed against the elder Duterte over his vicious drug war which killed thousands of drug suspects, as well as innocent bystanders.\n\n\u201cIt certainly puts the Dutertes in a spot where an extra constitutional option becomes a more enticing option for them,\u201d Llamas said, but noted that there must first be a vacancy for a succession battle to happen.\n\nAsked if Duterte-Carpio could become the leader of the political opposition after quitting the cabinet, Trillanes said, \u201cShe would be the de facto opposition leader by virtue of her relatively stronger political base. But [Akabayan party] Senator Risa Hontiveros would like to remain as an independent opposition leader.\u201d\n\nGutierrez noted, however, that Duterte-Carpio could \u201cbecome a third pole in the political landscape\u201d, but that would depend on how effectively she could garner support, given the midterm elections next year and whether she manages to emerge from her father\u2019s political shadow.\n\nSince 1986, the Philippines has followed a multiparty system that allows parties to either align themselves with the administration or ruling party, or be part of the opposition.\n\nThe political opposition currently has two leaders in the Senate: Senator Hontiveros of Akbayan and former Senate president Aquilino \u201cKoko\u201d Pimentel III of the original PDP-Laban Party.\n\nHontiveros\u2019 Akbayan issued a statement welcoming Duterte-Carpio\u2019s resignation as \u201clong overdue\u201d, noting that the vice-president\u2019s tenure as education secretary \u201chas been marred by massive controversies\u201d that the party said diverted attention from improving the country\u2019s education system.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news",

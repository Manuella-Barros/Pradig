This growth was driven by a stock split and a surge in demand for its AI processors. Nvidia reached record highs on Wednesday, with the AI chipmaker's valuation surpassing the $3 trillion mark and overtaking Apple as the world's second most valuable company. The company is set to conduct a ten-for-one stock split on June 7, potentially boosting its attractiveness to individual investors.\n\nNvidia's climb in market value above Apple signals a pivotal change in Silicon Valley, traditionally dominated by Apple since the iPhone's debut in 2007. Nvidia's shares increased by 5.2% to close at $1,224.40, bringing its valuation to $3.012 trillion, slightly above Apple's last recorded $3.003 trillion market cap after a 0.8% rise in its shares.\n\nMicrosoft remains the most valuable company globally, with a valuation of $3.15 trillion, following a 1.9% increase in its shares.Jake Dollarhide, CEO of Longbow Asset Management, noted that Nvidia is currently profiting from AI, while companies like Apple and Meta are heavily investing in it. He also suggested that Nvidia might soon outpace Microsoft, fueled by substantial retail investment.\n\nNvidia's shares have soared 147% in 2024, with demand for its high-end processors greatly exceeding supply as major tech firms like Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet vie to expand their AI computing capabilities. Since May 22, when Nvidia issued an impressive revenue forecast, its stock has risen nearly 30%. On Wednesday alone, Nvidia added nearly $150 million to its market capitalization, exceeding AT&T's total value. Overall optimism about AI contributed to a broad rally in chip stocks, with the PHLX chip index jumping 4.5% and Super Micro Computer, which utilizes Nvidia chips in its AI-optimized servers, climbing 4%.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang received extensive coverage on Taiwanese television and was greeted enthusiastically at the Computex tech trade fair in Taipei, his birthplace, before he moved to the United States. While Nvidia benefits from the current AI enthusiasm on Wall Street, Apple faces challenges such as declining iPhone demand and stiff competition in China, the largest smartphone market globally. Some investors also see Apple as trailing behind other tech giants in integrating AI into their products and services.\n\nDespite Nvidia's significant stock gains, analysts' projections for future earnings suggest that the stock, trading at 39 times expected earnings, is relatively less expensive compared to last year when it was over 70 times, according to LSEG data.", "source": {"uri": "electronicsb2b.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ElectronicsB2B"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aryaman_raghuvanshi@electronicsb2b.com", "name": "Aryaman Raghuvanshi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taipei"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Taipei"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.electronicsb2b.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Nvidia.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629044", "eventUri": "eng-9629044", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 422, "textEnd": 428}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 1470, "textEnd": 1476}], "sentiment": 0.5294117647058822, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

The AI chipmaker's market capitalization soared to $3.019 trillion, nudging past Apple's $2.99 trillion market cap, and is now just behind Microsoft, which stands at $3.15 trillion.\n\nNvidia's stock surged by 5.2% to around $1,224.4 per share, pushing its market cap over the $3 trillion mark. This significant leap places Nvidia among the elite, making it the third company in the US to reach this milestone, following Apple and Microsoft.\n\nShares of Apple, meanwhile, increased by 0.8% to $196, but this was not enough to maintain its position above Nvidia. The gains in Nvidia's stock also contributed to new record highs for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes.\n\nNvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom that has captivated Wall Street. The company's stock has surged by 147% this year, following a 239% increase in 2023. Nvidia's dominance in the AI semiconductor market is evident, accounting for approximately 70% of sales in this sector.\n\nLooking ahead, Nvidia is set to roll out its most advanced AI chip platform, Rubin, in 2026. This platform will succeed the Blackwell, which was introduced in March and hailed as the \"world's most powerful chip.\"\n\nHere's a snapshot of the financial standings and projections of Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple:\n\nNvidia's continuous advancements and strong market demand for its AI chips suggest it might not only maintain its position but potentially surpass Microsoft. Analysts believe Nvidia could become the world's first $4 trillion company, driven by the insatiable demand for AI technology.\n\nJensen Huang, in a recent statement, said, \"The Rubin platform will redefine the capabilities of AI technology, setting new benchmarks for performance and efficiency.\"\n\nIn an effort to make its shares more accessible to individual investors, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split.

At market close, Nvidia had a market value of $3.019 trillion, versus Apple's, which stood at $2.99 trillion.\n\nNvidia passed Apple in market valuation on Wednesday as investors continue betting on the chipmaker behind the artificial intelligence boom. It is now the second-most valuable public company, behind Microsoft. Shares of Nvidia rallied to record highs on Wednesday, with the AI chipmaker's stock market valuation hitting the $3 trillion mark. The latest share rally in Nvidia comes as it prepares to split its stock ten-for-one, effective on June 7, a move that could increase its appeal to individual investors.\n\nNvidia's market valuation\n\nThe surge in Nvidia's stock market valuation above Apple's underscores a shift in Silicon Valley, where the company co-founded by Steve Jobs has dominated since it launched the iPhone in 2007.\n\nNvidia also hit a $3 trillion market valuation milestone on Wednesday after shares rose over 5%. At market close, Nvidia had a market value of $3.019 trillion, versus Apple's, which stood at $2.99 trillion. Microsoft is the most valuable publicly traded company, with a market cap of $3.15 trillion, as of Wednesday.\n\nNvidia's growth in sales\n\nNvidia has an estimated 80% market share in AI chips for data centers, which are attracting billions of dollars in spending from big cloud vendors.\n\nInvestors are also becoming more comfortable that Nvidia's huge growth in sales to a handful of cloud companies can persist. For the most recent quarter, revenue in its data center business, which includes its GPU sales, rose 427% from a year earlier to $22.6 billion, about 86% of the company's overall sales.\n\nNvidia beats Apple\n\nApple shares are up only about 5% this year, as the iPhone maker's sales growth has stalled in recent months. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Apple said overall sales dropped 4% and iPhone sales fell 10% from the year-ago period.\n\nApple was the first company to reach a $1 trillion and $2 trillion market cap. It long held the title of most valuable U.S. company but was passed by Microsoft earlier this year. Microsoft has also benefited from investor demand for AI infrastructure.\n\nNvidia has been more volatile as a stock than Apple. Founded in 1991, the company was primarily targeting gaming, selling hardware to play 3D computer games. More recently, it sold cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud subscription services.\n\nNvidia shares rise\n\nNvidia shares have risen more than 24% since the company reported first-Q1 earnings in May and have been on a tear since last year. Nvidia shares have gone parabolic as its AI business has developed, rising more than 3,290% over the past five years. The company announced a 10-for-1 stock split in May.", "source": {"uri": "industryleadersmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Industry Leaders Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mia_garcia@industryleadersmagazine.com", "name": "Mia Garcia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "3D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PC game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Employment", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Associations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.industryleadersmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Nvidia-Beats-Apple-in-Market-Valuation-Hits-3-Trillion-Mark.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629044", "eventUri": "eng-9629044", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 649, "textEnd": 655}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, remained the world's most valuable company at $3.15 trillion following a 1.9 per cent rise in its shares.\n\n\"Nvidia is profiting from AI now, whereas companies like Apple and Meta are currently investing in AI,\" commented Jake Dollarhide, CEO of Longbow Asset Management. \"It seems likely that Nvidia will overtake Microsoft as well, with substantial retail investment pushing the stock higher.\"\n\nNvidia's stock has surged 147 per cent in 2024, driven by high demand for its premium processors from companies like Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Google-owner Alphabet, all striving to enhance their AI computing capabilities and lead in emerging technology.\n\nThe company's stock has rallied nearly 30 per cent since May 22, following an impressive revenue forecast.

This surge comes as investor interest continues to grow in Nvidia, which is at the heart of the boom in generative AI. Nvidia has now surpassed Apple to become the second-largest public company, just behind Microsoft.\n\nThis achievement is part of a remarkable trend, with Nvidia's stock price rising by over 3,224% in the past five years. Additionally, the company will undergo a 10-for-1 stock split later this month. Microsoft, the world's most valuable company, saw its stock rise by 1.91 percent, while Apple's stock gained 0.78 percent.\n\nNVIDIA's Rally Continues\n\nApple was the first U.S. company to reach a $3 trillion market cap during intraday trading in January 2022. Microsoft achieved a $3 trillion market value in January 2024. Nvidia, founded in 1993, reached a $2 trillion valuation in February and took roughly three months to surpass $3 trillion.\n\nNvidia's impressive rally is being powered by the company's graphics processing units that have sparked a boom in artificial intelligence (AI). Over the past year, Nvidia's revenues have soared by more than 260 percent as tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon rush to develop AI technologies.\n\nYear to date, Nvidia's shares have more than doubled, following a tripling in value in 2023.\n\nLast month, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split to make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors. This split, which takes effect on Friday, is expected to make the company's shares even more attractive to investors.\n\nIn May, Nvidia reported first-quarter earnings that highlighted continued strong demand for its expensive and powerful graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nThe company reported overall sales of $26 billion, more than triple what it made a year ago. Nvidia also exceeded Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings and projected revenue of about $28 billion for the current quarter.\n\nNo Stopping NVIDIA\n\nThis week's rally in Nvidia's stock follows an announcement on Sunday by CEO Jensen Huang. Speaking at an industry conference, he revealed that the company will release a high-powered version of its Blackwell chip, called the Blackwell Ultra, in 2025.\n\nThis will be followed by a new AI chip platform, Rubin, in 2026, and an Ultra version of Rubin in 2027.\n\nNvidia is the tech industry's leading supplier of AI chips and integrated software.\n\nTech giants, including Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla, use Nvidia's hardware to power their cloud-based AI offerings for customers as well as their own AI models and services.\n\nHowever, Nvidia isn't the only player in the AI chip market. AMD and Intel are advancing their own AI chips to challenge Nvidia. AMD has announced its MI325X and MI350 chips, which will be available in 2024 and 2025, respectively, and its next-generation MI400 AI accelerator platform, set to launch in 2026.\n\nIntel has introduced its Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3 AI accelerators, which promise to be more cost-effective than competing chips. With companies investing billions in AI chips, any cost savings will be significant.\n\nNvidia also faces growing competition from its own customers. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are working to reduce their reliance on Nvidia's chips to save on capital expenditures.\n\nDespite these challenges, Nvidia continues to dominate the AI space and is expected to maintain its leading position in the near term.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times, Singapore Edition"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_ghosh@ibtimes.sg", "name": "R.

This milestone comes as Nvidia gears up to implement a ten-for-one stock split, effective June 7, a strategic move aimed at enhancing its appeal to individual investors.\n\nNvidia's stock soared by 5.2% on Wednesday, closing at $1,224.40 and valuing the company at an impressive $3.012 trillion, while Apple's market capitalization settled at $3.003 trillion after a modest 0.8% increase.

With Nvidia's stock surging by 147% in 2024, demand for its cutting-edge processors has significantly outpaced supply, driven by the race among tech giants like Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet to dominate the AI computing landscape.\n\nThe optimism surrounding AI innovations has also buoyed chip stocks broadly, with the PHLX chip index witnessing a substantial 4.5% surge. Notably, Super Micro Computer, a company specializing in AI-optimized servers featuring Nvidia chips, experienced a 4% climb in its stock.\n\nNvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, has been the centre of attention, garnering extensive coverage on Taiwanese television and drawing crowds at the Computex tech trade fair in Taipei, his birthplace. Meanwhile, Apple faces challenges stemming from sluggish iPhone demand and stiff competition in China, the world's largest smartphone market, leading some investors to perceive the company as lagging in integrating AI features into its products and services.\n\nDespite Nvidia's remarkable stock gains, analysts remain bullish on its future earnings prospects. Trading at 39 times expected earnings, Nvidia appears comparatively less expensive than a year ago, when it traded at over 70 times expected earnings, according to LSEG data.\n\nREAD ALSO: Your Google Maps' 'Timeline' data may soon be deleted on the web.

The company first reached a $1 trillion valuation in May 2023 and then soared past $2 trillion in February of this year, overtaking both Amazon and Alphabet in terms of value.\n\nNeedless to say, Nvidia is drowning in money at the moment.

This surge in Nvidia's market value to surpass Apple is another landmark moment in the tech sector, as Apple had reigned supreme since the launch of its iPhone in 2007.\n\nEarlier this year, Apple was dethroned as the world's most valuable publicly listed company by Microsoft due to concerns over iPhone demand and Microsoft's investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which gave it a head start in generative AI. Now, Nvidia joins Microsoft and Apple as the only US stocks ever to exceed $3trillion in total value.\n\nFollowing overnight share increases across the sector, Microsoft is valued at $3.15trillion (\u00a32.46trillion), Nvidia at $3.012trillion (\u00a32.35trillion), and Apple at $3.003trillion (\u00a32.34 trillion). Nvidia's chips are fuelling much of the AI rush, making it a poster child for the AI boom, with demand for its processors from tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook owner Meta outstripping supply.\n\nNvidia's shares now up nearly 150% so far this year are also being buoyed by an upcoming move to split its stock by 10-to-one on Friday. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, commented on the stock split, saying it will \"bring its share price down and make it more affordable to investors who cannot afford to splash out more than a grand per share, as well as to benefit employees who use some of their monthly pay packet to invest in the company\".\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia hit all-time highs on Wall Street during a broader market rally, with the S&P 500 climbing 1.2% to surpass its record from two weeks prior, and the Nasdaq composite surging by 2%, setting a new record.

This significant milestone underscores the burgeoning optimism surrounding Nvidia's pivotal role in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nNvidia, the renowned chipmaker, has seen its stock skyrocket by over 200% this year, driven by its integral contributions to AI technology. This week, Nvidia's market capitalization reached $3.01 trillion, surpassing Apple and trailing only Microsoft, according to the Dow Jones Market Data Group.\n\nDuring a recent visit to Taiwan, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was lauded as a local hero. In Taipei, Huang detailed the transformative potential of AI during Computex 2024. Clad in his signature black leather jacket, he emphasized the radical shift from traditional computing to generative AI, which creates new information rather than retrieving it from existing data sets. \"The computing world has been mostly running on ideas that are 60 years old,\" Huang said. \"But after 20 years of collaboration with other tech giants, we've reinvented the computing wheel.\"\n\nNvidia's rise is not just a market phenomenon but also a reflection of its robust financial performance. The company reported a net income of $14.9 billion on revenue of $26 billion last quarter, a substantial increase from $0.7 billion in the final quarter of 2022. This profitability has made Nvidia a standout in the tech industry, with its high-margin chips being essential for training AI models and other advanced technologies.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives highlighted the broader implications of Nvidia's success. \"For the elite, transformational tech stories such as Nvidia and the AI Revolution, investors must see the forest through the trees,\" Ives said, predicting that 60% to 70% of enterprises will adopt AI, resulting in an estimated $1 trillion of incremental AI spend over the next decade.\n\nIn response to its soaring stock price, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split, effective June 10. This move aims to make shares more accessible to smaller investors by increasing the number of shares and reducing their individual value. Nvidia's stock, which closed at an all-time high of $1,224.40 on Wednesday, will be distributed at $122.44 per share post-split.\n\nThe AI-driven optimism has also contributed to broader market gains, propelling the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to new records. Nvidia's rapid ascent highlights the increasing importance of AI across various sectors and its potential to drive future technological advancements.\n\nFounded in 1993, Nvidia initially focused on graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming. However, the company has long been adding features to its chips to support machine learning, positioning it as a key player in the AI landscape. Huang has heralded this era as the \"next industrial revolution,\" driven by AI-powered technology.\n\nNvidia's rise comes amid a broader wave of investment in AI, with other tech giants like Microsoft also benefiting from their AI initiatives.

Whatever they wanted to pursue in life, they had to run for it. \"Run. Don't walk.\"\n\nIt's a message that Nvidia believers appear to have lapped up, too.\n\nInvestors in a desperate rush for a share of Nvidia's growing AI riches helped the Santa Clara-based chip giant surge past Apple to a $3 trillion market capitalization for the first time on Wednesday.\n\nIt's now the world's second most valuable company, placing it in a select club of $3 trillion titans that has just two other members: Microsoft and Apple. What is truly remarkable is the pace at which Nvidia got there.\n\nIt took Apple almost three years to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion. Microsoft accomplished the feat in January, about two and a half years after hitting $2 trillion in June 2021. But for Nvidia, the trip took little more than three months.\n\nThe growth story appears to have a simple explanation.\n\nInvestors have become increasingly certain that Nvidia's chips, known as GPUs, are the lifeblood of the generative AI boom, with large language models from the likes of OpenAI, Meta, and Google dependent on them.\n\nIn May, Huang offered the latest sign of how dependent Silicon Valley's most mighty AI companies are on his chips after reporting a massive 262% year-on-year rise in revenue for the first quarter of 2024 to $26 billion.\n\nNvidia has benefited from software, too, with its CUDA program serving as a plug-and-play system for developers seeking to use Nvidia GPUs for various complex AI tasks and training.\n\nCritically, Nvidia's entry into the $3 trillion club shows just how much hope is now being placed into AI.\n\nLast month, Huang signaled that Nvidia would shift from a two-year release cycle for new chips to a \"one-year rhythm\" to deliver more powerful hardware to desperate companies faster as they seek to push out ever-smarter AI models.\n\nMicrosoft has become the world's most valuable company on the back of hope in AI too. It has made strategic investments into the technology under the leadership of Satya Nadella in firms such as OpenAI.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple is preparing to make its next phase all about AI as it prepares to unveil a partnership with the ChatGPT maker at its WWDC event next week.\n\nWhat isn't clear is just how long AI can keep fueling this lighting growth. While Nvidia enjoys a near-unstoppable surge for now, it faces some challenges with competitors trying to come up with an alternative to its secret sauce CUDA, for example -- and geopolitical complexities with China making its dependence on Taiwan for manufacturing a risk.\n\nMicrosoft and Apple both face risks, too, by betting heavily on large language models, a type of AI that has shown itself to be vulnerable to errors.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CUDA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/business_insider_articles_888/725ffc056025dbcad57ec5ed69434f70", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629044", "eventUri": "eng-9629044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

However, Nvidia is close with a $3.01 trillion valuation.\n\nWith a market capitalization of $3.01 trillion, and Nigeria's GDP projected to hit $253 billion by 2024 end, the company's valuation is about 12 times the size of the Nigerian economy.\n\nNvidia Corporation, which is relatively less known than Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Hewlett Packard, Meta, Tesla, is at the forefront of next generation computing.\n\nThe company, through its AI-powered cloud services, AI microchips, data center GPU, and other heavy computing devices is the world's leader in advanced IT architecture.\n\nIn 2024, NVIDIA has been one of the most trending names in the global capital markets, due to the incredible gains, as well as exceptional financial performance. Thus, here are five things to note about Nvidia.\n\nNvidia was founded in 1993 by CEO, Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem. The founders had a vision of introducing 3D graphics to computer graphics and taking accelerated computing to the next level. They had their first contract with Japanese gaming company, Sega to build the graphics chip for the Dreamcast gaming console.\n\nBy 1999, Nvidia developed its first GPU product for sale, GeForce 256, and it was a commercial success. In the same year, the company went public, listing on NASDAQ with a share price of $0.44.\n\nNvidia is the world's leading producer of GPUs used in data centers and high-end computing devices. The company has ventured into AI chip making, and currently boasts a customer base of over 1,600 generative AI companies.\n\nIn May 2023, Nvidia crossed the $1 trillion valuation mark for the first time ever, as its share price hit $401.11. Before then, only Apple, Alphabet Inc (Google), Microsoft, and Amazon hit had the $1 trillion mark.\n\nIn June 2023, Nvidia comfortably settled in the $1 trillion valuation region. However, it continued a massive run, hitting the $2 trillion market cap in February 2024. It then crossed the $3 trillion mark on June 5, 2024.\n\nHaving recorded a year-to-date gain of 147.2%, Nvidia is the fastest gaining stock on NASDAQ 100 this year. With a share price of $1,224.40 as of close of trading on June 5, the stock has advanced well beyond the $481.68 it started 2024 with.\n\nNvidia stock overwhelmingly outperforms the NASDAQ Composite Index, which has posted a year-to-date gain of 16.40%. In one year, Nvidia posted a gain of 226.72%, as it closed June 6, 2023, with a share price of $374.75.\n\nThis is significantly higher than the gains posted by other companies within the $1 trillion valuation mark. Apple Inc has posted a 5.42% YTD gain, Meta Inc, 43.56% YTD gain, Alphabet, 27.44% YTD, and Amazon, 22.16% YTD gain, and Microsoft Inc with a 13.99% YTD gain.\n\nDuring the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, Nvidia posted a revenue of $60.9 billion, which marks a 126% growth from the previous fiscal year. It also posted a 681% growth in its operating income to $33 billion, representing an operating margin of 54.2%.\n\nNvidia's financial performance in the fiscal year was driven by a 217% growth in its data center revenue. The company recorded $47.5 billion from the sales of Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) and InfiniBand used in data centers.\n\nIt is quite notable that there is a boom in the data center market, as the number of internet-connected devices continues to increase, as IoT analytics put the number at 16.7 billion. As the data center industry booms, it is expected that Nvidia's revenue will also boom.\n\nNvidia is the leading supplier of GPUs, a critical element in data center. The company is also reputed to have a 98% share in the data center GPU market.\n\nAnother strong prospect for Nvidia is its high-power GPU which is used to power generative AI companies. Currently, ChatGPT runs on Nvidia's H100 graphics cards, while the company provides AI infrastructure for cloud services such as Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services.\n\nSpeaking on the company's strong performance in the past fiscal year, the CEO, Jensen Huang, highlighted the shift from traditional data centers to AI-powered data centers.\n\n\"Companies and countries are partnering with Nvidia to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center - AI factories - to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence.\"\n\nConsidering the growing size of its share price, Nvidia's board decided to carry out a 10-for-1 stock split. Essentially, shareholders will receive nine new stocks for every one they hold.\n\nThis stock split would be carried out on June 7, 2024, and trading on the split stock basis would commence on June 10.\n\nThe company noted \"make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors\" as the reason for the stock split. With a share price of $1,224.40, the stock split would result in a new share price of $122.44, which is more accessible to investors.\n\nIt would also increase the company's outstanding shares from 2.46 billion shares to 24.6 billion.", "source": {"uri": "nairametrics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nairametrics"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_olujinmi@nairametrics.com", "name": "David

Nvidia's market value (share price multiplied by the total number of shares) has now hit the $3 trillion mark - only Microsoft ranks higher in terms of market capitalisation.\n\n\"Such stratospheric share price rises can come with a drawback,\" says Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor. \"The bar has now been raised, meaning that the shares could be vulnerable to disappointment, with increasing pressure on the company to surprise to the upside.\"\n\nDespite this, he acknowledges that there is \"little sign of that for the moment\", as the chipmaker continues to go from strength to strength.\n\nWe look at what has driven the rise of this tech giant. Will it overtake Microsoft and should you invest in Nvidia stock? Plus, what will Nvidia's planned stock split on Friday 7 June mean for investors?\n\nNvidia has easily been the best performing of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks in recent years. Its share price has climbed by more than 150% year-to-date. Meanwhile, over the past five years, it has grown by more than 3,000%. These are glittering returns.\n\nInvestors looking to profit from the rising tide of AI have been snapping up the stock, making it one of the most popular investments on DIY platforms. This, combined with a string of impressive results, has propelled its rise.\n\nThe company reported its most recent earnings on 22 May - and they were impressive. First-quarter revenue was $26 billion, up 18% from the previous quarter and up 262% compared to a year ago.\n\nIn addition to its chips, growth in the company's data centre business has been driving its strong performance. Data centres made up 87% of overall revenues in the first quarter.\n\nThe company's ascent is \"remarkable\", says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, \"particularly as it is now considered to be more valuable than one of the most lauded electronic device makers in the world\".\n\nHe adds: \"There is a feeling that as long as Nvidia's share price is rising, investors are happy and everything is fine on the markets.\"\n\nAs far as the S&P 500 is concerned, this has quite literally become the case in recent years. Nvidia has accounted for around a third of the S&P 500's overall return so far this year. This makes concentration risk a concern for many investors - something we have explored elsewhere when looking at whether it's time to ditch tracker funds.\n\nNvidia now isn't far behind Microsoft, which has a market capitalisation of around $3.15 trillion (compared to Nvidia's $3.01 trillion). But given the rapid rate at which Nvidia is growing, the company might not be in Bill Gates's rear-view mirror for long.\n\nThe below chart from Reuters shows the trajectory the stock is on.\n\nThat's not to discount the outlook for Microsoft, which remains strong. The company has shown its ability to deliver consistent returns over the long term. What's more, it has embraced AI and has a strong plan for what it means for its business.\n\n\"The path to AI monetisation is clearest for Microsoft,\" says Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \"Its substantial AI investments have driven gains in its formidable cloud business, and its other products are also easily kitted out with AI additions.\"\n\n\"While there are rumblings of tech-spending pullbacks, the overriding message is that Microsoft remains potentially the biggest beneficiary of AI demand over the longer-term, when compared to its immediate peers,\" she adds.\n\nNvidia's share price continues to reach record highs - and investors on the sidelines will be disappointed they didn't snap it up earlier. But there are risks associated with investing at the top of the market. This begs the question, will Nvidia continue to soar?\n\nThe investment case all rests on the group's \"cutting edge\", \"market leading products\" and \"hugely dominant market share,\" according to Lund-Yates. \"Nvidia relies on a small number of customers for the bulk of its revenue, but these are high calibre names, who have a lot to lose by dabbling with lesser proved chip technology,\" she adds.\n\nIndeed, generative AI requires enormous computing power to work, and Nvidia's chips facilitate this. They can carry out technical processes faster and with greater energy efficiency than many competitor chips. The company describes itself as having \"pioneered accelerated computing to tackle challenges no one else can solve\".\n\nSome valuation-focused investors might worry that Nvidia - and Big Tech in general - has entered a bit of a bubble. But investors believe AI will revolutionise the world around us. It's these future opportunities that they are pricing in.\n\nOf course, there are risks associated and a regulatory clampdown could create headwinds. There are also concerns that AI is too energy-hungry, and that electricity grids might not be able to cope. We explored this topic in a recent MoneyWeek article: Should you invest in the US stock market and will Big Tech crash?\n\nAnother risk for Nvidia investors is that the market becomes more competitive - a challenge Tesla is facing at the moment.\n\nAs the AI revolution wages on, other chipmakers will continue to invest in their technology in an attempt to snap at Nvidia's heels, even if they're not quite there yet. Competitors include the likes of Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm.\n\nAs well as hitting the $3 trillion mark, Nvidia is in the headlines this week with a stock split. On Friday 7 June, common stock investors will see each of their shares divided in ten.\n\nThe company explains that this should \"make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors\". At the time of writing (prior to the split), a single share costs more than $1,200.\n\nOnce the stock split is carried out, Nvidia's share price will fall - but Mould points out that investors shouldn't panic. \"The market value of the business won't change, just its share price,\" he explains. It is a technical event.\n\nSometimes, stock splits can encourage a period of outperformance as they attract a wider pool of investors by making shares more affordable. That said, many trading platforms have offered fractional shares in recent years, helping get around the affordability problem.", "source": {"uri": "moneyweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyWeek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katie_williams@moneyweek.com", "name": "Katie Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Do it yourself"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trajectory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Gates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_analyst", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial analyst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Efficient energy use"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pB7mE2LBD3p27Gp2pAD8ic-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629044", "eventUri": "eng-9629044", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 76, "textEnd": 82}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 1079, "textEnd": 1085, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 1644, "textEnd": 1650}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Microsoft continues to hold the top spot with a market capitalisation of $3.15 trillion.\n\nThe impressive 147 per cent surge in Nvidia's stock price since the beginning of 2024 highlights the company's critical role in advancing AI technology. Major tech corporations, including Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet (Google's parent company), are heavily investing in Nvidia's high-performance chips to enhance their AI capabilities.\n\nThis surge in value follows Nvidia's optimistic revenue forecast released on May 22, which significantly boosted market confidence and caused the stock to jump nearly 30 per cent. Furthermore, the company's planned ten-for-one stock split, scheduled for June 7, is anticipated to attract even more interest from individual investors.\n\nALSO READ: Nvidia Rally Drives Investors Towards AI-Themed ETFs\n\nNvidia's ascent underscores a broader trend within the tech industry, where AI has become a central focus. Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, has emerged as a prominent figure in the tech world, drawing large audiences at events like the recent Computex trade show in Taipei.\n\nConversely, Apple is encountering hurdles, including a slowdown in iPhone sales and increasing competition in the vital Chinese market. Analysts have also pointed out that Apple may be falling behind in incorporating AI into its products and services.\n\nDespite its rapid growth, Nvidia's stock remains appealing based on future earnings projections.

The company will debut an Ultra version of Rubin in 2027.\n\nNvidia is the tech industry's go-to supplier for AI chips and integrated software.\n\nTech behemoths, including Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft, Tesla (TSLA), and others, use its hardware to power everything from their cloud-based AI offerings for customers to their own AI models and services.\n\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, jumps of 461% and 262%, respectively, from the same period a year ago.\n\nNvidia's Data Center revenue in the most recent quarter increased 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 86% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. Nvidia's gaming segment, which was previously its most important business, saw revenue of $2.6 billion.\n\nNvidia also announced that its stock would undergo a 10-for-1 split on June 7, and the company will raise its dividend from $0.04 per share to $0.10 per share.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't the only game in town.\n\nAMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are pushing forward with their own AI chips with the goal of outmaneuvering Nvidia. AMD recently announced its MI325X and MI350 will hit the market in 2024 and 2025, respectively, and said its next-generation MI400 AI accelerator platform will land in 2026.\n\nIntel, meanwhile, said its Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3 AI accelerators will undercut competing chips on price. And with companies spending billions on AI chips, any price savings will certainly be welcome.\n\nNvidia is also contending with growing competition from its own customers, as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft seek to wean themselves off of their dependence on the company's chips and save on capital expenditures while they're at it.\n\nFor now, though, Nvidia continues to maintain its grip on the AI space, and it will do so for the foreseeable future.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

This surge is part of a rapid climb that commenced last year, driven by widespread anticipation that the US-based firm is well-positioned to benefit significantly from the ongoing wave of investment in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe company's rise in value now places it just behind Microsoft, another major player in the tech industry, primarily due to its investments in OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT. Nvidia's market capitalization, previously valued at \"just\" $2 trillion as recently as February, experienced a renewed surge in share purchases following the announcement last month of plans for a stock split.\n\nScheduled to take place on Friday, the stock split will increase the number of shares by a factor of 10, subsequently reducing their value. This strategic move aims to make Nvidia shares more accessible to small-scale investors, generating heightened demand for the stock.\n\nEstablished in 1993, Nvidia initially gained prominence for manufacturing computer chips specialized in graphics processing, particularly for gaming. Anticipating the AI revolution, the company began incorporating features into its chips aimed at enhancing machine learning capabilities, contributing to its expanding market share.\n\nNvidia is now regarded as a pivotal player in assessing the proliferation of AI-powered technology across various sectors, a phenomenon Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, has hailed as the \"next industrial revolution.\" The company has witnessed explosive growth, reporting a staggering $26 billion in sales for the three months ending April 28 - a figure more than triple the corresponding period in 2023, with an 18% increase from the previous quarter.\n\nOptimism surrounding the potential of AI has been a driving force behind the broader market rally observed over the past year, propelling both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to record highs on Wednesday.\n\nWhile Apple had experienced a slowdown in sales growth earlier this year, recent weeks have seen its shares buoyed by anticipation regarding its AI integration strategy.

Microsoft currently holds the top spot.\n\nWednesday's rally came amid a broader gain in tech stocks, with softer US economic data and a decline in Treasury yields boosting markets on hopes the Federal Reserve may cut rates as early as July.\n\nNvidia has been the poster child for investor enthusiasm in AI, which accelerated with OpenAI's release of ChatGPT in late 2022.\n\nThe stock is up over 140% this year and 200% over the last year; Nvidia shares have gained more than 3,300% in the last five years. Over those same periods, the Nasdaq has gained a more modest 14%, 29%, and 126%, respectively.\n\nNvidia shares were steady in pre-market trading on Thursday, up less than 1%\n\nThis week's rally in Nvidia follows an announcement on Sunday from its CEO, Jensen Huang, who said at an industry conference the company will release a high-powered version of its Blackwell chip -- called the Blackwell Ultra -- in 2025, followed by a new AI chip platform, Rubin, in 2026. The company will debut an Ultra version of Rubin in 2027.\n\nNvidia is the tech industry's go-to supplier for AI chips and integrated software.\n\nTech behemoths, including Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft, Tesla (TSLA), and others, use its hardware to power everything from their cloud-based AI offerings for customers to their own AI models and services.\n\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, jumps of 461% and 262%, respectively, from the same period a year ago.\n\nNvidia's Data Center revenue in the most recent quarter increased 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 86% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. Nvidia's gaming segment, which was previously its most important business, saw revenue of $2.6 billion.\n\nNvidia also announced that its stock would undergo a 10-for-1 split on June 7, and the company will raise its dividend from $0.04 per share to $0.10 per share.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't the only game in town.\n\nAMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are pushing forward with their own AI chips with the goal of outmaneuvering Nvidia. AMD recently announced its MI325X and MI350 will hit the market in 2024 and 2025, respectively, and said its next-generation MI400 AI accelerator platform will land in 2026.\n\nIntel, meanwhile, said its Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3 AI accelerators will undercut competing chips on price. And with companies spending billions on AI chips, any price savings will certainly be welcome.\n\nNvidia is also contending with growing competition from its own customers, as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft seek to wean themselves off of their dependence on the company's chips and save on capital expenditures while they're at it.\n\nFor now, though, Nvidia continues to maintain its grip on the AI space, and it will do so for the foreseeable future.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

That's more than triple the $7.2 billion it reported in the same period a year ago. Wall Street expects Nvidia to bring in revenue of $117 billion in fiscal 2025, which would be close to double its revenue in 2024 and more than four times its receipts the year before that.\n\nNvidia's estimated net margin, or the percentage of revenue that gets turned in profit. Looked at another way, about 53 cents of every $1 in revenue Nvidia took in last year went to its bottom line. By comparison, Apple's net margin was 26.3% in its most recent quarter and Microsoft's was 36.4%. Both those companies have significantly higher revenue than Nvidia, however.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_energy_consumption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric energy consumption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cache (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Rankings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Rankings", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/ibq9ao/article68257792.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2024-06-05T192525Z_2006826915_RC2658AV1TTG_RTRMADP_3_NVIDIA-STOCKS-APPLE.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629044", "eventUri": "eng-9629044", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 1343, "textEnd": 1349}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1409, "textEnd": 1415}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nIt's now the world's second most valuable company, placing it in a select club of $3 trillion titans that has just two other members: Microsoft and Apple. What is truly remarkable is the pace at which Nvidia got there.\n\nIt took Apple almost three years to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion. Microsoft accomplished the feat in January, about two and a half years after hitting $2 trillion in June 2021. But for Nvidia, the trip took little more than three months.\n\nThe growth story appears to have a simple explanation.\n\nInvestors have become increasingly certain that Nvidia's chips, known as GPUs, are the lifeblood of the generative AI boom, with large language models from the likes of OpenAI, Meta, and Google dependent on them.\n\nIn May, Huang offered the latest sign of how dependent Silicon Valley's most mighty AI companies are on his chips after reporting a massive 262% year-on-year rise in revenue for the first quarter of 2024 to $26 billion.\n\nNvidia has benefited from software, too, with its CUDA program serving as a plug-and-play system for developers seeking to use Nvidia GPUs for various complex AI tasks and training.\n\nCritically, Nvidia's entry into the $3 trillion club shows just how much hope is now being placed into AI.\n\nLast month, Huang signaled that Nvidia would shift from a two-year release cycle for new chips to a \"one-year rhythm\" to deliver more powerful hardware to desperate companies faster as they seek to push out ever-smarter AI models.\n\nMicrosoft has become the world's most valuable company on the back of hope in AI too. It has made strategic investments into the technology under the leadership of Satya Nadella in firms such as OpenAI.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple is preparing to make its next phase all about AI as it prepares to unveil a partnership with the ChatGPT maker at its WWDC event next week.\n\nWhat isn't clear is just how long AI can keep fueling this lighting growth. While Nvidia enjoys a near-unstoppable surge for now, it faces some challenges with competitors trying to come up with an alternative to its secret sauce CUDA, for example -- and geopolitical complexities with China making its dependence on Taiwan for manufacturing a risk.\n\nMicrosoft and Apple both face risks, too, by betting heavily on large language models, a type of AI that has shown itself to be vulnerable to errors.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hasan_chowdhury@businessinsider.com", "name": "Hasan Chowdhury", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CUDA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66619ea7d0b8e1c832cc6ae0?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629044", "eventUri": "eng-9629044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

After all, Nvidia stock has shot up an impressive 576% during this period, which means that an investment of $1,000 in its shares three years ago is now worth more than $6,750.\n\nThe stock market has rewarded Nvidia investors with such handsome gains thanks to the impressive growth in its top and bottom lines.\n\nHowever, as the above chart indicates, Nvidia's revenue and earnings growth started taking off only from the second half of 2023 once customers started lining up to buy its artificial intelligence (AI) chips. The good part is that this catalyst could help Nvidia stock sustain its impressive momentum over the next three years as well. Let's look at the reasons why.\n\nWhen Nvidia released its results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (which ended on April 28) last month, it became clear that it continues to remain the dominant player in the lucrative AI chip market.\n\nThe company's revenue shot up a terrific 262% year over year to a record $26 billion. Non-GAAP earnings jumped 461% to $6.12 per share. The numbers were well ahead of what the market was forecasting. The positives didn't stop there, as Nvidia's revenue guidance of $28 billion for the current quarter means that its top line is set to more than double once again from the year-ago period's reading of $13.5 billion.\n\nThe company managed to deliver such terrific growth even though its current generation of Hopper AI chips is about to be replaced with the new Blackwell generation. Management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that it witnessed \"strong demand\" for the Hopper graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nThe good part was that Nvidia was able to increase the supply of its previous generation H100 GPU so that it could fill more demand. However, the company also pointed out that the demand for its latest Hopper flagship -- the H200 processor -- was stronger than supply. Additionally, Nvidia is expecting that the demand for its Blackwell chips, which are already in production, will remain ahead of supply \"well into next year.\"\n\nWhat this means is that the demand for Nvidia's AI GPUs is so strong that the company is unable to manufacture enough chips. Even better, its competitors are unable to fill the supply void as Nvidia reportedly commands 60% of the advanced chip packaging capacity -- which is required to produce AI chips -- of its foundry partner. As a result, Nvidia continues to dominate the AI chip market with an estimated share of more than 95% as per some estimates.\n\nThe good part is that Nvidia's foundry partner TSMC is set to expand its advanced chip packaging capacity at an annual rate of 60% through 2026. This bodes well for Nvidia, as it should ideally be able to manufacture more AI chips and reduce lead times for customers waiting to get their hands on the company's hardware.\n\nHigher production should ideally translate into more revenue growth and allow Nvidia to maintain its solid share of the AI chip market that's expected to generate annual revenue of $400 billion in 2027 as compared to $45 billion last year, according to fellow chipmaker AMD.\n\nWe have seen that the market for AI chips is set to boom over the next three years. When combined with Nvidia's outstanding market share in this space, it is easy to see why analysts are expecting its top-line growth to take off over that time frame.\n\nNvidia finished the previous fiscal year with just under $61 billion in revenue, and the chart above indicates that its top line is forecasted to nearly triple over the next three years. However, certain analysts are expecting Nvidia's revenue to grow even faster by 2027 and outpace Wall Street's expectations.\n\nAs such, there is a good chance that Nvidia will continue to remain a top growth stock over the next three years as well. With shares of the company now trading at 42 times forward earnings, which is in line with the U.S. technology sector's average price-to-earnings ratio, buying Nvidia looks like a no-brainer considering the pace at which it is expected to grow over the next three years.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harsh_chauhan@fool.com", "name": "Harsh Chauhan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopper_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hopper (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_fabrication_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor fabrication plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TSMC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Snack_Foods", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Snack Foods", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Rankings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Rankings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/779413/man-in-specs-holding-a-smartphone.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629044", "eventUri": "eng-9629044", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-28", "textStart": 1013, "textEnd": 1021}], "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, Apple faces weak iPhone demand and stiff competition in China.\n\nAccording to S&P Dow Jones Indices, five companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), account for about 60% of the S&P 500's total return of over 12% this year. Nvidia alone has contributed roughly a third of this gain, following a 147% surge in 2024.\n\nAngelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, highlighted potential market vulnerability if these key stocks falter and the rest of the market does not provide support.\n\nTajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at LSEG, expects the earnings gap between the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies and the rest of the S&P 500 to narrow as 2024 progresses.\n\nRecent reports indicated that Nvidia is preparing to ramp up investments in Taiwan, with plans to build its second supercomputer there. This underscores the importance of crucial supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM).\n\nNvidia has already tapped Samsung Electronics Co for the supply of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips and is now eying Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) as a potential supplier to overcome the supply chain constraints.\n\nAnalysts reaffirmed Nvidia as the lead AI beneficiary after the recent Taiwan event, citing opportunities with its Hopper platform and Blackwell B100/200.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_Dow_Jones_Indices", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P Dow Jones Indices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taipei"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Taipei"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TSMC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Financial Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Publicly_Traded", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Publicly Traded", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/moved_LYNXNPEK1L01K_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629044", "eventUri": "eng-9629044", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 246, "textEnd": 252}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Furthermore, the quenchless drive for Nvidia chips to power cutting-edge AI technologies has accrued a whopping $ 1.8 trillion this year.\n\nThis financial boost also upped the shares of Nvidia by 5.2% to close at a record $ 1,224.40 and thereby pushed the company's revenue past the $ 3 trillion mark. Interestingly, the last time Nvidia overtook Apple was 22 years back in 2002 when the latter was establishing its footing in the tech world.\n\nNvidia's financial success is partly the reason for the aggressive plans of the company's CEO Jensen Huang. Huang has made grand plans to ramp up the production of its utilitarian chipsets in this AI boom in the market. According to an inside report from the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Nvidia's stake in the AI boom has accrued them an amount between $ 5 billion to $ 107.4 billion.\n\nFurthermore, according to Huang, Nvidia is expected to be playing an even bigger role in the technological boost in the coming days. It also means that the company will be scraping off a lion's share of the entire financial remuneration that is segmented in the technical field.\n\nAngelo Zino, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research believes that this shift in the financial axis in favour of Nvidia is just a drop in the ocean. Zing remarked on the immense potential of the company by stating, \"We see this sea change as in the very early innings.\"\n\nCurrently, Nvidia is only behind Bill Gates' Microsoft Corporation which has the highest market size.

The company crossed the $3 trillion mark for the first time ever, overtaking Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and most telling, Apple.\n\nAt this same point last year, we reported on Nvidia passing the $1 trillion mark for the first time. A little over 12 months later, Nvidia has tripled in value, and it's on track to overtake Microsoft as the most valuable company in the U.S.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe milestone comes hot the heels of a two-hour Computex presentation where Nvidia effectively took a victory lap. It didn't make major announcements, instead reserving reveals for sunch things as Project G-Assist and its new small form factor guidelines for press releases. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang instead spent the time talking about generative AI, how Nvidia powers that generative AI, and why a room full of the most powerful executives in the tech industry should continue buying Nvidia's products.\n\nJust two years ago, Nvidia wasn't even remotely in the same conversation as companies like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. Its monumental rise was brought on by ChatGPT, which unleashed a frenzy throughout the tech industry less than two years ago. Nvidia's hardware is at the heart of the GPT model, and it has become the gold standard for generative AI hardware in data centers around the world since then. Its main competitors, AMD ($268 billion market cap) and Intel ($131 billion market cap) have spent the last 18 months trying to respond.\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox! Privacy Policy\n\nThis rise is really due to AI, too. In May, when Nvidia released its financial results, it noted revenue of $22.6 billion for its data center business -- a 427% increase from a year ago. For context, that's close to 10 times more than its gaming business that sells PC graphics cards, and even that segment saw an 18% growth over the past year. A year ago, the data center business was only twice as large as gaming.\n\nIt's a strange situation for gamers who have primarily known Nvidia for graphics cards, and a strange situation for the tech industry as a whole. We don't often see massive keynote presentations like the one Nvidia showcased at Computex where there are effectively no announcements. Nvidia is one of the only companies that can stand in that position. The CUDA foundation it has invested in for decades is the bedrock of generative AI, effectively giving Nvidia its own space in the market that competitors like AMD and Intel have struggled to enter.\n\nNvidia is so prominent in generative AI that the U.S. Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are launching investigations into Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI, Politico reports. These three companies, two of which are now the most valuable companies in the U.S., are at the center of the generative AI conversation.\n\nAlthough Nvidia is now the second most valuable company in the U.S., there's still a war raging over generative AI. Apple is hosting its annual Worldwide Developer's Conference (WWDC) on Monday, where we expect to see a host of new generative AI features for Apple products. Amazon has experimented with generative AI features over the past year as well.\n\nThe battlefield for the AI war isn't on your phone or PC, though. It's taking place in the data center. Companies like AMD and Intel are the ones gunning for Nvidia's crown, trying to regain the ground they lost since the introduction of ChatGPT.\n\nEditors' Recommendations These were the best new

Now, thanks to huge revenue and profits, all driven by the tech world's desire to have everything and everyone infused with AI, Nvidia's share prices have reached such a point that its market cap is now an astonishing three trillion dollars -- higher than Apple, Google, and Amazon.\n\nOnly Microsoft has a larger market cap, though the margins between it, Nvidia, and Apple are all very narrow. Well, if one can call tens of billions of dollars 'narrow.' For those unfamiliar with the term market capitalisation, it's a relative measure of how valuable a company is on stock markets, with the figure determined by a simple multiplication of the number of company shares by the current share price.\n\nAt the time of writing, Microsoft's shares sell for around $420, whereas Apple's are roughly half that figure. Nvidia, though, is deemed so valuable right now that buying just one of its shares will set you back over $1,200. That's almost enough to buy its best graphics card, the GeForce RTX 4090, though you'll still be short by $400 or so.\n\nAnd it's all down to the fact that tech companies can't get enough of Nvidia's superchips, such as the Hopper H100 and the recently launched Blackwell range. These are monstrously huge and expensive processors (or in some cases, multiple processors) designed to handle the billions of calculations required for AI training and inference.\n\nNo retail prices exist for these products, as such, but you're looking at figures 20 times that of an RTX 4090 and companies like Meta, OpenAI, and X are buying hundreds of thousands of them. This is why revenues for Nvidia's data centre division have skyrocketed, with $22.5 billion being generated in the last three months -- ten times that of its gaming division.\n\nIt's not just about revenue, though, as AMD will tell you. It took over $5.5 billion in revenue in the first quarter of this year but only saw a net income of $1 billion. For the same period, Nvidia's net income was a little under $15 billion from a revenue of $26 billion. It's not hard to see why its share prices have climbed so rapidly.\n\nProfits alone aren't the only reason why Nvidia is now deemed the second most valuable company in the world. It's also about the fact that, at the moment, no other business can produce as many AI megachips as Nvidia, with the complete software stack and performance demanded by its customers. TSMC, the chip manufacturer that's contracted to fabricate all of Nvidia's Hopper and Blackwell processors, simply can't make enough of them to meet demand, either.\n\nThat demand shows no sign of tailing off any time soon, even though AMD and Intel are pushing ahead with humongous chips of their own. Amazon and Google make AI processors for their own needs, but OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, and X don't. And they're all knocking at Nvidia's doors for its products.\n\nRight now, Microsoft has the highest market cap of any company -- $3.15 trillion -- thanks to a combination of massive earnings ($62 billion in revenue, $22 billion net income, in the last quarter) and because it's throwing everything it can at AI. From Copilot+ PCs to privacy-concerning Recall, Microsoft wants AI to be a key part of every bit of software it churns out.\n\nAnd as we've seen at Computex 2024, the majority of ancillary tech firms and hardware vendors are hot on Microsoft's tails, plastering AI onto motherboards, graphics cards, SSDs, and even power supply units, despite almost none of them actually using AI. That's not to dismiss the use of machine learning, as it has some clear applications and benefits in gaming, but no PSU is ever going to work better because of a neural network.\n\nArtificial intelligence might not be making much of a difference to your life at the moment but for Nvidia, it's the road to becoming the most valuable company in the world.", "source": {"uri": "pcgamer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pcgamer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_evanson@pcgamer.com", "name": "Nick Evanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopper_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hopper (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_RTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia RTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GeForce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stack (abstract data type)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motherboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_supply_unit_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Power supply unit (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TSMC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial neural network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solid-state drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bLqSjQze5JVwnLLPQ5Ks2N-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629044", "eventUri": "eng-9629044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5294117647058822, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

At 12:36 p.m. ET on Thursday, the stock was still up 8.5%.\n\nThe catalysts that sent the semiconductor specialist higher were intriguing developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and a highly anticipated stock split.\n\nNvidia took center stage at the Computex trade show in Taiwan this week, as CEO Jensen Huang delivered the keynote address. Multiple media accounts suggest that the chief executive was treated like a rock star, with throngs of fans cheering him on and photographers from the local media documenting his every move.\n\nOf interest to investors was Huang's announcement that Nvidia has accelerated its product upgrade cycle. \"Our company has a one-year rhythm,\" he noted. \"Our basic philosophy is very simple: Build the entire data center scale, disaggregate and sell to you parts on a one-year rhythm, and push everything to technology limits.\"\n\nThis has significant implications for Nvidia's future success. Rivals have been scrambling to develop a worthy competitor to Nvidia's gold-standard AI processors, but the accelerated timeline will make that task even more difficult.\n\nThe other major factor at play is Nvidia's highly anticipated 10-for-1 stock split, which will take place after market close on Friday. The frenzy has been building in recent weeks and briefly pushed Nvidia above a $3 trillion market cap for the first time.\n\nSome investors have been fretting in recent months about whether the AI revolution has staying power, but the available evidence suggests AI adoption continues at a brisk pace. Just this week, Hewlett Packard Enterprise reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results and cited the uptake of AI as the driving force. This suggests the proliferation of AI will continue.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia is the leading provider of chips used in machine learning -- an earlier branch of AI -- with an estimated 95% share of the market, despite competing AI chips that have been around for years. Nvidia also controls an estimated 95% of the market for data center graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nThis suggests that despite rising competition, Nvidia is still the name to beat in AI processing.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danny_vena@fool.com", "name": "Danny Vena", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_Global", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynote", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keynote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett_Packard_Enterprise", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett Packard Enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/779891/the-letters-ai-swirling-in-a-tornado-like-cloud-above-stock-charts.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629044", "eventUri": "eng-9629044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

This impressive growth has allowed Nvidia to surpass Apple and become the world's second-largest company, behind Microsoft, which holds a market capitalisation of $3.15 trillion. This milestone moment occurred one day before Nvidia's 10-for-1 share split, which may have acted as a catalyst for the surge as investors sought to capitalise on the opportunity.\n\nInvestors who own Nvidia's stock at the end of Thursday will be eligible for the share split, allowing them to receive nine additional shares for each share they hold by then. This move will result in shares being valued at one-tenth of the market value at the closing price on Friday. Nvidia's stocks will halt trading during this period and will resume on Monday, 10 June, when the US markets open.\n\nThe primary objective of a stock split is to lower the price of individual shares, thereby enhancing accessibility for investors. It is worth noting that, while this action reduces the share price, it does not alter the company's market capitalisation or valuations.\n\nNvidia has also increased its quarterly cash dividend by 150% to $0.1 per share from $0.04 per share. The amount is on a post-split basis and \"will be paid on Friday, 28 June 2024, to all shareholders of record on Tuesday, 11 June 2024,\" according to the company's press release in May.\n\nThanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, the chip maker's share price has soared by 32% month on month, 145% year-to-date, and 214% over the past year.\n\nSince 2023, Nvidia's Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) have been in high demand due to their advancements in supporting machine learning, Large Language Model (LLM) training, and supercomputing capabilities. The company holds a monopolistic position in AI chip manufacturing, accounting for approximately 80% of the market share. Its customers include all the major tech players, such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and OpenAI. CFO Colette Kress revealed that approximately 45% of Nvidia's Data Centre revenue stemmed from these cloud providers. Demand for Nvidia's H100 was particularly robust, driven in part by Meta's utilisation of Lama 3.\n\nAdditionally, CNBC reported that Tesla CEO Elon Musk is prioritising Nvidia's H100 GPUs for his privately owned social media platform X and his AI startup xAI ahead of Tesla. xAI, founded by Elon Musk in July 2023, is a startup AI firm that offers chatbots and AI-powered tools, competing with companies like OpenAI. He posted in X that Tesla would spend $10 billion (\u20ac9.2 billion) \"in combined training and inference AI\" this year.\n\nNvidia's growth accelerated in the past year, with the revenue from Data Centre surging to $22. 56 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 from $4.28 billion in the first quarter of the fiscal year 2024, representing a 427% increase. The AI darling's overall revenue soared 262% to $26 billion in the same quarter, from $7.19 billion a year earlier.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang has expressed confidence that Nvidia's new supercomputing AI GPU, Blackwell, will spearhead the company's growth in the coming year, stating: \"We are poised for our next wave of growth. The Blackwell platform is in full production and serves as the cornerstone for trillion-parameter-scale generative AI.\"\n\nHuang hinted at Nvidia's strategic shift towards diversifying its product offerings across various sectors, including consumer internet companies, automotive manufacturers, and healthcare providers, rather than solely focusing on cloud businesses.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Sharing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Sharing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/48/22/98/1200x675_cmsv2_7bc46797-10d6-54e7-a106-def113a55f4f-8482298.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629044", "eventUri": "eng-9629044", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 978, "textEnd": 985}], "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Index Trends, D-Day Remembered\n\nAfter Nvidia saw its stock increase by an incredible 239% in 2023, it's already up another 147% so far this year. Over the last 5 years, shares are up nearly 3,300%.\n\nWhile the company's success has been long-sustained, its recent bump higher can be attributed to a couple of things. In the first quarter of 2024, the AI chip giant beat analyst estimates with profit skyrocketing over 600 percent.\n\nAnd on June 2 CEO Jensen Huang unveiled Nvidia's new generation of AI chips - saying \"\"With our innovations in AI and accelerated computing, we're pushing the boundaries of what's possible and driving the next wave of technological advancement.\"\n\nNvidia now trails only Microsoft, which has a market cap of $3.15 trillion.\n\nThat'll do it for your daily briefing.

At 12:36 p.m. ET on Thursday, the stock was still up 8.5%.\n\nThe catalysts that sent the semiconductor specialist higher were intriguing developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and a highly anticipated stock split.\n\nNvidia took center stage at the Computex trade show in Taiwan this week, as CEO Jensen Huang delivered the keynote address. Multiple media accounts suggest that the chief executive was treated like a rock star, with throngs of fans cheering him on and photographers from the local media documenting his every move.\n\nOf interest to investors was Huang's announcement that Nvidia has accelerated its product upgrade cycle. \"Our company has a one-year rhythm,\" he noted. \"Our basic philosophy is very simple: Build the entire data center scale, disaggregate and sell to you parts on a one-year rhythm, and push everything to technology limits.\"\n\nThis has significant implications for Nvidia's future success. Rivals have been scrambling to develop a worthy competitor to Nvidia's gold-standard AI processors, but the accelerated timeline will make that task even more difficult.\n\nThe other major factor at play is Nvidia's highly anticipated 10-for-1 stock split, which will take place after market close on Friday. The frenzy has been building in recent weeks and briefly pushed Nvidia above a $3 trillion market cap for the first time.\n\nSome investors have been fretting in recent months about whether the AI revolution has staying power, but the available evidence suggests AI adoption continues at a brisk pace. Just this week, Hewlett Packard Enterprise reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results and cited the uptake of AI as the driving force. This suggests the proliferation of AI will continue.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia is the leading provider of chips used in machine learning -- an earlier branch of AI -- with an estimated 95% share of the market, despite competing AI chips that have been around for years. Nvidia also controls an estimated 95% of the market for data center graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nThis suggests that despite rising competition, Nvidia is still the name to beat in AI processing.\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The company, whose market value just surpassed $3 trillion, is coming under scrutiny for its high-demand artificial intelligence chips. The Federal Trade Commission is also looking into Microsoft and OpenAI, Politico reported.\n\nNvidia has overtaken tech giant Apple to be the second-most valuable company in the world; Microsoft holds the top spot.\n\nNvidia has been growing at breakneck speed over the last year, as investors bet on the continued growth of artificial intelligence. The company's value has increased by 50% since February, the BBC reported.\n\nA potential antitrust investigation into Nvidia and other large tech companies is a continuation of the Biden administration's efforts to rein in Big Tech, New York Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin wrote in his Dealbook newsletter, and it follows similar attempts at regulation in the European Union. Both the Department of Justice and the FTC have stressed that in the case of AI, they want to avoid a repeat of allowing social media and online advertising companies to grow unfettered, potentially hurting competition and leaving consumers worse off, Politico noted.\n\nNvidia is on a sharp upward trajectory, but how long it will last is an open question. Competition, including from other tech giants that make their own chips, could soon nip at Nvidia's 80% market share. Chips could also lose importance as the development of AI continues beyond the current protocol of building and training generative models, which requires vast amounts of computation. Geopolitics, particularly tensions between the US and China, may also impact Nvidia in the long run. US officials could decide to further restrict Nvidia from exporting AI-relevant technology to China, a key market, an investment researcher told Business Insider.\n\nNvidia owes its success in part to a number of smaller companies that operate in the AI sphere, and many of them are based in Taiwan, Bloomberg reported. The island is strategically important for chip makers and world governments seeking to advance AI -- companies there produce vital components for the tech, including motherboards, servers, and cooling systems. During the first few days of the ongoing Computex conference in Taipei, Nvidia was notably courting more niche Taiwanese firms, a sign that these smaller companies \"hold a key position in the global supply chain,\" an analyst told Bloomberg.

This enabled the organization to ascend to the second most valuable corporation in the globe. Furthermore, Nvidia's share price increased to unprecedented levels during this period, surpassing that of Apple.\n\nA 5.16 percent increase from the previous closing price of $1,224.40 for the chipmaker's shares. This was the scenario in which the market elected to cease operations entirely. Apple's market capitalization reached $3.00 trillion at the market's conclusion, and its shares had increased by 0.78% since the market's inception.\n\nThe fact that the stock market valuation of Nvidia has surpassed that of Apple is emblematic of the substantial shift that has occurred in Silicon Valley. Since the iPhone was first introduced to the public in 2007, the company that Steve Jobs played a key role in establishing has been the most influential actor in Silicon Valley.\n\nMicrosoft remains the most valuable company in the world, with a market value of $3.14 trillion, and it continues to resist competition from other corporations. The corporation's headquarters are situated in Redmond, Washington. The company's shares experienced a minor increase on the same day, rendering it the sole company to attain such an extraordinary valuation.\n\nAlthough Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, are in a fierce competition to enhance their artificial intelligence computing capabilities and establish themselves as the dominant force in the technology development industry, the demand for Nvidia's top-of-the-line processors is significantly outpacing the supply.\n\nThe stock of the company has increased by nearly thirty percent since the announcement that Nvidia made their most recent outstanding sales projection public on May 22nd.\n\nThe PHLX chip index experienced a 4% increase on Wednesday as a result of a surge in the equities of semiconductor firms. This suggests that investors were optimistic about artificial intelligence, which resulted in a significant increase in the equities of semiconductor companies.\n\nIt was discovered that Super Micro Computer, a company that specializes in the development of servers that are specifically engineered for artificial intelligence and are constructed with Nvidia processors, experienced a nearly five percent increase.\n\nThis week, Jensen Huang, the Chief Executive Officer of Nvidia, has been the subject of an incessant stream of coverage in Taiwanese media. Computex, the technical trade exhibition, was held in Taipei, the city where he was born before relocating to the United States. Taipei was the location of Computex.\n\nUpon his entrance at the exhibition, he was enveloped by individuals who were also participating in the event for their own benefit.\n\nHowever, Apple is currently facing challenges due to the intense competition in China, the world's largest smartphone market, and the low demand for iPhones. Conversely, Nvidia is capitalizing on the Wall Street community's enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, which is in stark contrast to the circumstances previously described.\n\nConversely, there are investors who believe that Apple is falling behind other technological titans in its efforts to integrate artificial intelligence components into its products and services. Furthermore, there are investors who contend that Apple is falling behind its competitors.\n\nSEE ALSO:", "source": {"uri": "chiangraitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTN News l Chiang Rai

One thing is clear: Cutting-edge computer chips have become the de facto building blocks of AI. They are needed (in mass quantities) to power these powerful AI operations.\n\nWhen it comes to picking AI stocks, there have been some clear winners, as well as some stocks that haven't caught fire the way one might have expected. AI is still in the early chapters of its story, which means there is still plenty of uncertainties, but also plenty of opportunities to find stocks that will utilize the need for AI to outperform over time.\n\nHere are three AI stocks investors should consider buying and holding because of the powerful AI tailwinds expected to benefit them.\n\n1. Nvidia: This chip leader continues to defy expectations\n\nAI chip powerhouse Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn't the most creative choice for this list, but the numbers matter most, and Nvidia has them in spades. Nvidia's cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) and AI-focused software stack have emerged as the go-to option for big technology companies investing billions of dollars to build data centers to handle AI's computing demands. Some analysts estimate that Nvidia controls as much as 90% of the AI chip market.\n\nTo underline this, look at how Nivida's revenue has grown over the past 18 months:\n\nNVDA Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts\n\nNvidia's $22.6 billion in data center revenue in Q1 is almost as much as the company generated in total revenue for all of fiscal year 2023 (ending Jan. 29, 2023). That is a massive uptick in just 24 months. And the stock price has followed; shares are up 585% over the past three years.\n\nHowever, the show might not be over. CEO Jensen Huang said he believes that AI will require another $2 trillion in data center spending, which could mean Nvidia enjoys these tailwinds for years. Shares trade at a forward P/E of 42 today. That's very attractive if Nvidia can live up to analysts' estimates, which call for 38% annual earnings growth over the next three to five years.\n\n2. AMD: Second place doesn't seem so bad\n\nAssuming AI becomes as big a deal as it seems, the most significant risk to a company like Nvidia is that it cedes AI chip market share to competitors. Who is most likely to challenge Nvidia? Look no further than Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), or AMD. It might not seem like a worthy opponent -- the chip company made $2.3 billion in data center sales in Q1, a fraction of Nvidia's. However, those figures were up 80% year over year, which shows signs of life, mainly due to demand for AMD's MI300 accelerator chips, which compete with Nvidia.\n\nAMD also has a footprint outside of data centers. For example, AI-enabled personal computers could represent a significant growth opportunity. AMD's Ryzen 8000 Series processor chips helped post an 85% year-over-year Q1 increase in AMD's Client segment. The great thing about AMD is that it doesn't have to knock Nvidia off the mountain to perform well for investors. The company could grow like wildfire due to AI. Analysts believe AMD's earnings will grow by 42% annually over the next three to five years, potentially exceeding Nvidia's bottom-line growth!\n\nAMD EPS LT Growth Estimates data by YCharts\n\nMeanwhile, AMD is a fraction of Nvidia's size at a $263 billion market cap. Shares trade at a forward P/E of 49, which is an excellent value for AMD if it can meet analysts' expectations.\n\nOne might argue that there is even more upside if AMD can meaningfully dent Nvidia's AI chip dominance over the coming years. AMD might be second place today, but it could be a top investment if things go well.\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $713,416!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

In February, the company was valued at $2tn, with the rapid rise galvanised by Nvidia's plans for a stock split.\n\nThis split, set to happen on 7 June, would increase the number of shares ten times, and reduce their value, which would make Nvidia shares more affordable.\n\nStarting off as a computer chip company mainly geared towards video games, Nvidia is now seen as the leader in the AI chip frontier, with the company aiming to stay at the forefront of chip technology to enable further AI expansion.\n\nShareholders have clearly responded to the strategy, as Nvidia saw sales triple since April 2024 compared to April to June 2023.

One thing is clear: Cutting-edge computer chips have become the de facto building blocks of AI. They are needed (in mass quantities) to power these powerful AI operations.\n\nWhen it comes to picking AI stocks, there have been some clear winners, as well as some stocks that haven't caught fire the way one might have expected. AI is still in the early chapters of its story, which means there is still plenty of uncertainties, but also plenty of opportunities to find stocks that will utilize the need for AI to outperform over time.\n\nHere are three AI stocks investors should consider buying and holding because of the powerful AI tailwinds expected to benefit them.\n\nAI chip powerhouse Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn't the most creative choice for this list, but the numbers matter most, and Nvidia has them in spades. Nvidia's cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) and AI-focused software stack have emerged as the go-to option for big technology companies investing billions of dollars to build data centers to handle AI's computing demands. Some analysts estimate that Nvidia controls as much as 90% of the AI chip market.\n\nTo underline this, look at how Nivida's revenue has grown over the past 18 months:\n\nNvidia's $22.6 billion in data center revenue in Q1 is almost as much as the company generated in total revenue for all of fiscal year 2023 (ending Jan. 29, 2023). That is a massive uptick in just 24 months. And the stock price has followed; shares are up 585% over the past three years.\n\nHowever, the show might not be over. CEO Jensen Huang said he believes that AI will require another $2 trillion in data center spending, which could mean Nvidia enjoys these tailwinds for years. Shares trade at a forward P/E of 42 today. That's very attractive if Nvidia can live up to analysts' estimates, which call for 38% annual earnings growth over the next three to five years.\n\nAssuming AI becomes as big a deal as it seems, the most significant risk to a company like Nvidia is that it cedes AI chip market share to competitors. Who is most likely to challenge Nvidia? Look no further than Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), or AMD. It might not seem like a worthy opponent -- the chip company made $2.3 billion in data center sales in Q1, a fraction of Nvidia's. However, those figures were up 80% year over year, which shows signs of life, mainly due to demand for AMD's MI300 accelerator chips, which compete with Nvidia.\n\nAMD also has a footprint outside of data centers. For example, AI-enabled personal computers could represent a significant growth opportunity. AMD's Ryzen 8000 Series processor chips helped post an 85% year-over-year Q1 increase in AMD's Client segment. The great thing about AMD is that it doesn't have to knock Nvidia off the mountain to perform well for investors. The company could grow like wildfire due to AI. Analysts believe AMD's earnings will grow by 42% annually over the next three to five years, potentially exceeding Nvidia's bottom-line growth!\n\nMeanwhile, AMD is a fraction of Nvidia's size at a $263 billion market cap. Shares trade at a forward P/E of 49, which is an excellent value for AMD if it can meet analysts' expectations.\n\nOne might argue that there is even more upside if AMD can meaningfully dent Nvidia's AI chip dominance over the coming years. AMD might be second place today, but it could be a top investment if things go well.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $713,416!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Its plans to increase the number of its shares ten-fold is set to generate even more demand for them and could see it become more valuable.\n\nIt overtook iPhone maker Apple to sit close behind software group Microsoft, which is also riding the AI wave through its close partnership and being the largest investor in ChatGPT, the company that launched the fastest-growing AI consumer product, reaching 100 million users in just a few months.\n\nNvidia's achievement saw it more than double in value in the last six months but its meteoric success has left most people scratching their heads wondering just how the chipmaker has become such a stellar stock market performer that it has added its latest trillion dollars in valuation in little over three months.\n\nThe unprecedented rise of this Californian-based firm is remarkable because it doesn't make an app or a search engine or anything else that might appeal to smartphone or laptop using consumers. It has been driven by the computer chips it makes and the part they play in powering everything from smart cars, computer games, cryptocurrency markets as well as many of the graphic fireworks employed by Hollywood blockbusters.\n\nThe chips are at the cutting edge of artificial intelligence applications, which may have the potential to disrupt virtually every major industry - so much so that Jensen Huang, Nvidia's co-founder and chief executive, recently claimed the arrival of AI has heralded a \"new Industrial Revolution\".\n\nThe 61-year-old's optimism is founded on the fact the Nvidia's chips are driving much of the rush into artificial intelligence, to the extent that along with ChatGPT, it has become a poster child of the AI boom, with demand for its processors from the likes of Google, Microsoft and Facebook owner Meta outstripping supply.\n\nNvidia's dedicated AI chips offer the promise of making and running AI models faster and cheaper. Unlike traditional computer chips, such as those found inside laptop and desktop computers, which are essentially designed to do one thing after another, Nvidia's chips are designed in a way that lets them run thousands of versions of the same task at the same time.\n\nArtificial intelligence software programmes also involves running lots of copies of the same task in parallel. Experts say that working out how to write AI code to run on Nvidia's chips was one of the key factors that triggered the currentboom.\n\nTraining AI algorithms also require substantial computing power, costing millions of pounds and taking weeks to complete. Nvidia's chips offer greater efficiency compared to older chips leading to faster and more affordable results.\n\nAround the globe, data centres currently account for between 1-1.5 per cent of global electricity use, according to the International Energy Agency. The AI boom in artificial intelligence could drive that figure up a lot - and fast.\n\nAccording to one study if the current trends in AI capacity lead to Nvidia shipping 1.5 million AI chips a year, by 2027 they would, running full on, consume more power than many small countries use in a year.\n\nFor all its apparent \"overnight\" success, Taiwanese-born Mr Huang, who came to the US to live with his uncle aged nine and later graduated as an electrical engineer, foresaw the need for computers to be able to carry out massive number-crunching rapidly back in the 1990s.\n\nTogether with his co-founders, they set up the company backed with Silicon Valley venture capital to find a solution. Mr Huang suggested the name Nvidia from \"invidia\", the Latin word for \"envy\". NVision, the company's first choice had to be discarded after it was discovered the name was already taken by a manufacturer of toilet paper.\n\nThe company, which promotes the \"pursuit of excellence through intellectual honesty\", has been described as \"close-knit\" with many of its thousands of employees long-serving - not always a common characteristic of tech firms more famed for their \"move fast and break it\" models of operating.\n\nMr Huang says he had no idea how self-driving cars would evolve or when AI would arrive. He says all he had was the belief that the type of chips which he had first seen in graphical computing initially used in console games were superior to others, and invested in them to make sure his company was ready to capitalise on the opportunities created by a major shift in tech.\n\n\"I've been talking about the same story for 15 years,\" he told Fortune magazine. \"I've barely had to change my slides.\"\n\nDespite passing the $3trn milestone, Nvidia aren't resting on their laurels. They've already announced they plan to launch bigger and faster chips this summer. Those chips would bring in \"a lot\" of revenue this year, Mr Huang said.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_connett@inews.co.uk", "name": "David Connett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Industrial Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PC game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vehicular automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-driving car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Console_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Console game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fortune (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SEI_207496960.jpg?w=1200&h=675&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629044", "eventUri": "eng-9629044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

The artificial intelligence or AI chipmaker is gaining on the surging demand for AI chips worldwide.\n\nThe company was continuing its upbeat rally, with a 1.4 percent increase in pre-market activity on the Nasdaq on Thursday, following a 5.2 percent jump in the previous day. Nvidia is currently valued at $3.012 trillion.\n\nApple is currently valued at $3.003 trillion, while tech major Microsoft Corp. currently holds the top spot with a valuation of $3.151 trillion.\n\nNvidia shares were gaining particularly since Monday after the chipmaker announced plans to launch its next generation of AI chips. Ahead of the tech expo Computex in Taiwan, the company's Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang announced the plan to release Blackwell Ultra, a high-powered version of its Blackwell chip, in 2025, and a new AI chip platform, Rubin, in 2026. The company also plans to debut an Ultra version of Rubin in 2027.\n\nDuring the event, he had told the crowd that \"the next Industrial Revolution has begun.\" Nvidia further introduced new tools and software models on the eve of the trade show.\n\nThe Rubin chip platform reportedly will have new graphics processing units or GPUs that help train and launch AI systems. There would also be other new features like a central processor called 'Vera.'\n\nThe company, which has pledged to release new AI chip technology on a one-year basis, in March had launched its previous AI super chip Blackwell GPU, which is said to do some tasks 30 times faster than its predecessor.\n\nThe Blackwell model is still in production and expected to ship to customers later in 2024. The Blackwell platform succeeds the NVIDIA Hopper architecture, which was launched two years ago.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "source": {"uri": "rttnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTTNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopper_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hopper (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Industrial Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Snack_Foods", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Snack Foods", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://cdn.rttnews.com/articleimages/ustopstories/2024/june/ainvidia-jun06-lt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629044", "eventUri": "eng-9629044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

China's biggest chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) climbed 4% in Hong Kong, while Japan's Tokyo Electron, the country's most valuable chip firm, advanced 4.3%.\n\n\"Nvidia's valuation milestone underscores the explosive growth potential in AI chips as tech giants race to launch more AI products,\" said Rajiv Menon, an analyst at CLSA. \"This is having a ripple effect across the semiconductor supply chain, lifting shares of Nvidia's suppliers and rivals.\"\n\nNvidia's market value has skyrocketed from $1 trillion to $3 trillion in just over a year, fueled by the rising popularity of generative AI tools like ChatGPT. The company makes the most advanced AI processors currently available, putting it in pole position to benefit from the AI boom.\n\nSentiment was further boosted by upbeat comments from Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML Holding, seen as a bellwether for the chip industry. ASML indicated improving demand from its top customers, mainly TSMC.\n\nOther Nvidia suppliers like Foxconn and Japanese chipmakers Advantest, Renesas Electronics and Disco Corp posted gains of 3-5%. Smaller Chinese players Will Semiconductor and NAURA Technology also ticked higher.\n\n\"As AI goes mainstream, we expect a multi-year upcycle in chip demand and technology investments,\" Menon said. \"While Nvidia is leading the charge, the entire semiconductor ecosystem is poised to benefit from this transformative megatrend.\"\n\nHowever, analysts also cautioned that chip stocks have run up significantly and some consolidation is likely in the near term. Geopolitical risks around US-China tensions and supply chain disruptions also remain potential headwinds for the sector.\n\nIndian tech stocks rallied after NVIDIA surpassed Apple to hit a $3 trillion market cap, driven by the AI boom. TCS, Infosys and Tata Communications, which have AI partnerships with NVIDIA, were among the top gainers. TCS and Infosys are each training 50,000 employees on AI technologies with NVIDIA's support. Tata Communications will leverage NVIDIA's advanced GH200 Grace Hopper chip to build an AI cloud platform in India.\n\nTCS shares rose 1.1% to \u20b93,788, while Infosys gained 1.73% to \u20b91,454.95.

The company's rise in value has been truly spectacular, increasing from $2T back in February to more than $3T just four months later.\n\nThe company is now challenging Microsoft for the title of most valuable company in the world, and for the same reason ...\n\nBBC News reports.\n\nNvidia's market value has surged past $3tn (\u00a32.3tn), lifting the chipmaker ahead of Apple to become the second most valuable publicly listed company in the world. The firm's share price rose more than 5% on Wednesday, to more than $1,224.\n\nWhile Nvidia is best known for its high-end GPU chips used in gaming computers, it made a smart decision quite some time back to ensure its chips were also optimised for machine-learning tasks - and that bet really paid off once AI became the hottest thing in tech. That led to a massive increase in sales this year.\n\nNvidia has seen explosive growth, reporting sales of $26bn in the three months to 28 April - more than triple the same period in 2023, and up 18% from the previous three month.\n\nBack in February, the company previewed a chatbot which runs on-device on a Windows PC.\n\nAI is also behind Microsoft's own soaring valuation, which has been significantly boosted by its investment in OpenAI - the company behind ChatGPT.\n\nBuying shares in Nvidia is also set to become much more accessible tomorrow, thanks to a 10-to-1 stock split. Instead of having to spend over $1200 per share, you'll be able to invest in chunks of $120-ish, meaning small investors will be better placed to buy the stock.\n\nApple's own valuation has climbed 7% in the past month, the market likely encouraged by the AI announcements set to be made in next week's WWDC keynote.\n\nOne downside of the company's success is that it's caught the attention of antitrust regulators, as NY Times reports.", "source": {"uri": "9to5mac.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "9to5Mac"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_lovejoy@9to5mac.com", "name": "Ben Lovejoy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Valuation_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Valuation Services", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/06/Nvidia-overtakes-AAPL.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629044", "eventUri": "eng-9629044", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-28", "textStart": 1001, "textEnd": 1009}], "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Both numbers were better than what Wall Street was looking for. The data-center business, which produced 87% of Nvidia's revenue, played a stellar role in this growth. After all, Nvidia's data-center revenue jumped a whopping 427% year over year to a record $22.6 billion last quarter thanks to its dominant position in the AI chip market.\n\nHowever, there was another business that reported healthy growth of 45% from the year-ago period. Though this business is currently producing a small portion of Nvidia's top line, the immense opportunity in this segment indicates that it could move the needle in a bigger way in the future. Let's take a closer look at it.\n\nNvidia's professional-visualization business -- which includes sales of professional graphics cards used in workstations and its Omniverse platform that helps users make virtual designs of real-world objects -- gained impressive traction in the previous quarter.\n\nMore specifically, Nvidia's professional-visualization revenue increased to $427 million in the previous quarter from $295 million in the prior-year period. On the company's latest earnings-conference call, Nvidia management attributed this healthy growth to the growing demand for its Omniverse digital-twin solutions.\n\nAccording to CFO Colette Kress:\n\nIt is worth noting that Nvidia has built a solid base of customers for its Omniverse digital-twin solutions, including the likes of Mercedes-Benz and BMW. And now, the company is looking to expand the reach of the Omniverse platform by offering it as a platform-as-a-service. Developers and enterprises will be able to use Nvidia's Omniverse platform with a subscription for creating digital twins, training autonomous vehicles, and testing and simulating robots.\n\nMore specifically, Nvidia is offering cloud-based application-programming interfaces (APIs) that will allow developers to integrate its software for creating digital-twin applications. The good part is that its Omniverse Cloud APIs are already being offered by multiple industrial-software companies such as Microsoft, Siemens, Rockwell Automation, Ansys, and Cadence, among others.\n\nThese moves should allow Nvidia to capitalize on the growing digitalization within the industrial space. Mordor Intelligence estimates that the manufacturing industry's digital transformation could generate a whopping $876 billion in revenue in 2029. The digital-twin market, on the other hand, is expected to generate $240 billion in annual revenue in 2035 compared to an estimated $13 billion this year.\n\nAll this indicates that Nvidia's professional-visualization business has tremendous room for growth in the future and could very well become an additional catalyst for the company along with its data-center and gaming businesses.\n\nIn its investor day presentation a couple of years ago, Nvidia management said it sees a $150 billion addressable opportunity for its Omniverse enterprise-software platform, along with another $150 billion for related hardware. The company's fiscal Q1 professional-visualization revenue suggests that it is on track to generate annual revenue of $1.7 billion from this market in fiscal 2025.\n\nNvidia, therefore, seems to be at the beginning of a massive growth curve in professional visualization. Meanwhile, the company estimates that its total addressable market (TAM) across all of its businesses stands at a whopping $1 trillion. Again, that's not surprising considering that it is serving fast-growing markets such as AI chips.\n\nWith Nvidia's revenue expected to nearly double in the current fiscal year to $120 billion, it can be said that the company has tapped just over 10% of its TAM. As such, there is a good chance that Nvidia could remain a high-growth company in the long run, making it an ideal bet for investors looking to add a growth stock to their portfolios.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

The Nvidia stock price has more than doubled on a year-to-date basis, increasing 132% in value. This builds on the stock's rapid rise in 2023.\n\nEnterprises have sought to leverage generative artificial intelligence to create efficiencies within their businesses since its world stage debut last year. Controlling some 80% of the AI chip market, Nvidia's stock has plenty of steam left to increase even further.\n\nA few days ago, Nvidia along with several of its chip marker competitors gave their respective keynotes at the Computex conference in Taiwan.\n\nWhile we have already heard plenty of news about Nvidia's Blackwell chips (B100 and B200) that are slated to come out later in 2024, CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the chip firm's road map for other advanced chips that will be available in 2025 and 2026.\n\nThe \"Blackwell Ultra\" will launch with 12-Hi HBM3E compatibility, which in layman's terms just means \"really high memory bandwidth.\"\n\nSucceeding the Blackwell series of chips will be the Rubin and Rubin Ultra GPUs that will support next generation 8-Hi HBM4 and 12-Hi HBM4 memory chips that will double performance speeds.\n\nAlthough many might not realize, hardware is just one facet of chipmaking. You need good software to make that hardware operate efficiently.\n\nNvidia's CUDA software is another dimension of performance for these new GPUs. The chipmaker has worked to craft and hone this software over many years, ultimately putting it ahead of others attempting to compete in the market.\n\nCompetitors AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) were also present at the Computex conference and delivered their own compelling keynotes.\n\nHowever, it was hard not to see that both chipmaking companies seriously lagged Nvidia. AMD's Lisa Su's announced the MI325X chip that will launch later in the year, but this series is chips is still behind the cutting-edge chips Nvidia will produce in 2024.\n\nSimilarly, Intel's new Gaudi 3 chips will be able to run AI models 1.5x faster than Nvidia's H100 chips but will likely not match the Blackwell chips in performance.\n\nUnlike AMD, however, Intel continues to struggle with its Foundry (chip manufacturing) business, which has continued to churn out significant losses, keeping it behind contract chipmaker TSMC (NASDAQ:TSM) and, as a result, Nvidia stock.\n\nWall Street isn't prepared to let go of the AI craze yet either. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri maintained his firm's \"Buy\" rating and increased their price target to $1,200/share.\n\nHe believes Nvidia's outlook overall remains positive since demand for AI chips continues to outpace supply. With competitors slowly ramping up their development of AI chips, the pricing power in the burgeoning AI chip market will remain in Nvidia's hands for the foreseeable future.\n\nBank of America is feeling optimistic as well. The banking firm increased their price target to $1,500/share, which is about 30% higher than where the stock traded as markets closed on Monday. Subsequent price upgrades from other Wall Street firms would not be surprising.\n\nWhile the chip stock trades at 39.7x forward earnings, I believe investors will still be willing to pay the premium.", "source": {"uri": "investorplace.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InvestorPlace"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyrik_torres@investorplace.com", "name": "Tyrik Torres", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CUDA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bandwidth (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Su", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lisa Su"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TSMC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Snack_Foods", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Snack Foods", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Publicly_Traded", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Publicly Traded", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/nvda1600-13.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629044", "eventUri": "eng-9629044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

The chipmaker's stock is responsible for a third of the gain in the S&P 500 market this year.\n\nIt is worth more than Apple, but looking at fundamentals, it is treated very differently.\n\nApple has more than 7 times the revenues and about 4 times the profits of Nvidia. Apple of course is not growing. Investors are betting heavily that Nvidia's revenues will continue to grow.\n\nIs this a bubble? Technology markets are prone to exuberance and bubbles. And stock prices can depart from fundamentals. One analysis from BofA, below, suggests that, unlike the dotcom bust, that divergence hasn't yet happened.\n\nOn the other hand, if we go back to the 1840s railway mania in Britain, the equivalent of 5-7% of GDP was invested in the nascent technology annually, much of it wasted.\n\nThat 5-7% of GDP today would be roughly $1.1 to 1.5 trillion dollars in the US per annum. In the last 12 months, Nvidia has added $1.2 trillion to its market cap.\n\nEarlier this week, in the frenzy around the firm, the company's boss, Jensen Huang, was spotted signing an avid fan's top. Not sure if there was an equivalent during Railway mania.\n\nNvidia has picked up the pace. The firm introduced Rubin, a new series of data centre chips, replacing the Blackwell, which was only announced in March. This is a new clock speed for the chip industry.\n\nIn the first quarter of this year, data centre chips accounted for $22.56bn in revenues. In the whole of FY24, that business was $47bn. It's obvious AI is driving the growth -- UBS reckons that one company, most likely Microsoft, accounted for 19% of the firm's revenues.\n\nBased on my conversations with execs, I don't see demand for AI apps slowing down at all. Mostly, I hear, \"We are starting, pleased with the results and eager to do more.\" Apple is yet to roll out AI widely to its user base; much of this will happen on the device, but some will happen in data centres. And we shouldn't rule out the biggest AI firms' plans to spend billions (and more) on chips for new frontier models.\n\nAt the same time, such a juicy market will flesh out competitors, including AMD, ARM, and others. Businesses will want greater efficiencies as costs start to mount up.

However, the stock's lofty price has reignited the debate about its true value.\n\nWhat Happened: New York University Stern School of Business Professor Aswath Damodaran, known as Wall Street's \"Dean of Valuation,\" believes Nvidia's intrinsic value doesn't justify its current price tag.\n\nDespite this, he acknowledged the company's achievements in a CNBC interview: \"If you are designing the perfect momentum company from scratch, Nvidia would be it.\"\n\n\"A great story, a CEO who sticks to the story, no distractions, is able to meet expectations of the short term because they have set the game up and you've got a market that contributes to the mix,\" he said.\n\n\"I think that you'll see one of the great momentum plays of all time playing out in front of you,\" Damodaran added.\n\nWhile an early Nvidia investor, Damodaran sold his holdings in mid-2023 due to the stock's rapid rise. \"I cannot in good conscience hold on to it and call myself a value investor,\" he stated then. He reiterated this concern earlier in 2024, acknowledging Nvidia's strength but expressing his belief that the price had become excessive.\n\nSince then, Nvidia's stock price has risen over 54%, with a current forward price-to-earnings ratio of 47.17.\n\nAI Mania: Revisiting his view on Nvidia, Damodaran acknowledged the evolving landscape.\n\n\"My basic story is bigger than it was a year ago, partly because of what Nvidia has delivered and partly because of what AI is showing in due in the overall economy and market,\" he said. He also pointed to Hewlett-Packard's recent earnings report as evidence of AI's influence beyond hardware.\n\n\"I think, you're seeing AI percolate ... go beyond the architecture part of the business into services, into products, into the rest, the software, and I think you're going to start to see the ripple effect shock in other companies,\" he said.\n\nOvervalued, But With Potential Paths: While maintaining his view that Nvidia is overvalued, Damodaran offered a surprising concession. \"I would say, based on my story,..$3 trillion is too high a number,\" he stated. However, he acknowledged the potential for future growth, saying: \"But I think this is a story we could find plausible paths to get to $3 trillion if you add on additional markets.\"\n\n\"One of the things about momentum companies is there is a plausible path to get to these really high numbers, and when the momentum is in your favor, you'll find those paths.\"\n\nNvidia's surge has helped propel the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 to new highs. However, tech analyst and venture capitalist Gene Munster has warned that the market might be in the early stages of an AI-powered bull run destined to end in \"a spectacular bubble burst.\"\n\nStock Split Coming: Nvidia closed Wednesday's trading session up 5.16% at $1,224.40, according to Benzinga Pro data. The stock rose another 2.01% in pre-market trading on Thursday.\n\nThe company will undergo a 10-for-1 stock split on Friday after the market closes. The new share price will reflect the split when trading resumes on Monday.\n\nRead Next: Nvidia's AI Muscle Propels Stock Past Apple To No. 2 Spot On SPY Holdings: What Investors Need To Know\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aswath_Damodaran", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aswath Damodaran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intrinsic value (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University_Stern_School_of_Business", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York University Stern School of Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_investing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Value investing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price\u2013earnings_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price\u2013earnings ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq_Composite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq Composite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/moved_LYNXNPEK1L0CN_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629044", "eventUri": "eng-9629044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

Gene Wang/Getty Images\n\nJensen Huang has added about $93 billion to his net worth in under 18 months, leaving him just three spots away from breaking into the ranks of the world's 10 wealthiest people.\n\nThe Nvidia cofounder and CEO's 3.5% stake in his company was worth less than $14 billion at the start of last year. With a fortune of that size now he'd barely crack the top 150 on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nSince then, Nvidia stock has skyrocketed from below $150 to north of $1,200 -- an increase of more than 700%. The chipmaker's market capitalization just passed $3 trillion for the first time, leapfrogging Apple to become the world's second-largest public company after Microsoft ($3.15 trillion).\n\nHuang now ranks 13th on Bloomberg's rich list with a $107 billion fortune. Only Michael Dell ($109 billion), Mukesh Ambani ($109 billion), and Warren Buffett ($135 billion) stand between him and a top 10 spot.\n\nBernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH, remains top of the list with a $212 billion fortune -- $8 billion more than Jeff Bezos.\n\nNvidia and Huang have seen such sensational gains because of the artificial intelligence craze. Companies like Microsoft, Tesla, and Meta are buying Nvidia's graphics processors by the truckload as they rush to build everything from AI-powered chatbots and recommendation systems to self-driving cars and humanoid robots.\n\nThe demand boom fueled a huge rise in Nvidia's revenue to $26 billion, and pushed net income to $14.9 billion in the three months to April 28.\n\nBy comparison, Meta's revenue was $36.5 billion and net income $12.4 billion in the first quarter of this year.\n\nInvestors have piled into Nvidia stock because they're convinced AI is transforming the world, and the chipmaker will play a critical role in powering the revolution.\n\nAs a byproduct of that belief, Huang's wealth has grown by roughly eightfold in under 18 months.", "source": {"uri":

She is an award-winning financial journalist who has worked in London, where she is currently based, and Hong Kong. She previously worked at The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) shares are rising in premarket trading after a surge Wednesday to a market cap of more than $3 trillion led the artificial intelligence (AI) darling to overtake Apple (AAPL) as the world's second-largest company after Microsoft (MSFT); shares of Lululemon Athletica (LULU) are soaring after the activewear maker raised its buyback plans by $1 billion and issued an improved full-year outlook; American depositary receipts (ADRs) of chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) are gaining beyond their record close as the AI frenzy spreads to the world's largest contract chip manufacturer; Five Below (FIVE) shares are tumbling after the discount retailer cut its sales outlook for the year; and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is reportedly investigating whether Microsoft structured one of its latest deals with AI startup Inflection to avoid an antitrust review. U.S. stock futures are little changed in premarket trading. Here's what investors need to know today.\n\nShares of Nvidia (NVDA) are extending their gains by about 2% in premarket trading after surging more Wednesday to a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion -- a threshold previously surpassed by just Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). Nvidia is now the world's second-largest company by market value, having overtaken Apple and trailing only Microsoft. Apple hit the $3 trillion mark in record time -- taking just 96 calendar days to go from $2 trillion to that level. Nvidia, which has consistently surpassed lofty earnings forecasts, has established itself as the clear leader in AI semiconductors and got a further boost Sunday when Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jensen Huang unveiled its next-generation AI platform. The company is due to carry out a 10-to-1 stock split after market close Friday, with split-adjusted trading to begin on Monday.\n\nShares of Lululemon Athletica (LULU) are soaring 8% in premarket trading after the activewear maker raised its full-year profit guidance and boosted its stock buyback program by $1 billion as it posted better-than-expected quarterly results. For fiscal 2024, the company now sees earnings per share (EPS) of $14.27 to $14.47, versus its earlier forecast of $14 to $14.20. In addition, the company, which repurchased $296.9 million of its shares in the first quarter, authorized an additional $1 billion to its stock buyback program, indicating management's confidence of the company's strategy and execution moving forward.\n\nEnthusiasm for all things AI as Nvidia surpasses $3 trillion in market cap is also driving up shares of other AI plays. American depositary receipts (ADRs) of chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), which closed Wednesday at a fresh all-time high, are gaining a further 1.8% in premarket trading. Shares of both TSMC and ASML Holding (ASML) jumped Wednesday after analysts reported that the Dutch firm is optimistic that TSMC will receive its advanced chipmaking machine this year. Shares of ASML, whose lithography technology is used to mass-produce semiconductor chips, are 0.6% higher. TSMC is the world's largest contract chip manufacturer and makes chips for Nvidia and Apple, among others.\n\nFive Below (FIVE) shares are tumbling 16% in premarket trading after the discount retailer cut its sales outlook for the year and issued first-quarter sales that CEO Joel Anderson called \"disappointing\" as inflation continued to take a toll on consumers' spending. Five Below reported first-quarter sales of $811.9 million, below analysts' forecasts, and said it sees fiscal 2024 net sales to be between $3.79 billion and $3.87 billion, down from a previously announced range of $3.97 billion to $4.07 billion. \"The quarter solidified that consumers are feeling the impact of multiple years of inflation across many key categories, such as food, fuel and rent, and are therefore far more deliberate with their discretionary dollars,\" Anderson said on a call with analysts, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is reportedly investigating whether Microsoft structured a deal with AI startup Inflection to avoid an antitrust review. The Wall Street Journal reported that the regulator is looking into Microsoft's hiring of Inflection AI's co-founder and almost all its employees, as well as the tech giant's payment of about $650 million to the startup as part of a license fee so it could resell the technology. The FTC, the report said, has sent subpoenas to both companies, questioning whether their deal evaded government review. The acquisition is already under investigation by U.K. regulators, who are probing whether deals made by Microsoft for Inflection's staff and France's Mistral, as well as Amazon's (AMZN) purchase of Anthropic, could hurt competition in the AI market. Microsoft shares are edging 0.3% lower in premarket trading.", "source": {"uri": "investopedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investopedia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The transaction caused the renowned money manager's firm to miss out on a rally that could have brought in a roughly $1.2 billion return.\n\nNevertheless, ARK Invest CEO claims that her firm is strategically positioned in artificial intelligence (AI) assets. Speaking at the Greenwich Economic Forum in Hong Kong this week, Wood highlighted Ark's diversified exposure to emerging AI companies while maintaining Nvidia shares in specialized portfolios and the flagship fund.\n\nArk Investment initially bought Nvidia shares in 2014 when they were trading at $4 on a split-adjusted basis. The majority of Nvidia sales took place in November 2022, just before the release of ChatGPT spark a massive artificial intelligence-driven rally in the stock market.\n\nDespite selling most of its position before Nvidia's recent surge, Wood mentioned that Nvidia shares have gained 15% since May 24, following strong first-quarter sales and an optimistic second-quarter forecast. The stock has more than octupled since late 2022, reaching around $1,224, with a market value surpassing $3 trillion, overtaking Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nReflecting on the decision to reduce Nvidia holdings, Wood said, \"We began to look at other companies that could benefit from AI if Nvidia continued its rapid ascent.\"\n\nWhile she remains positive about the semiconductor sector, she acknowledged a strategic pause as companies reassess their AI strategies. Wood cited Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) Inc. as an example of a company that has yet to see the expected revenue boost from AI this earnings season.\n\nWood also defended Ark's continued investment in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., describing it as the \"biggest AI project on earth\" due to its advancements in autonomous driving. Ark increased its Tesla holdings in the first quarter amid concerns over a slowdown in electric vehicle consumption and competition from Chinese automaker BYD Co (SZ:002594).\n\nWood said earlier that she is still not convinced by Nvidia's sky-high valuation. \"I've watched Nvidia throughout my career, ever since it went public. It's a very cyclical stock,\" Wood said, adding that over-ordering of Nvidia's GPUs could lead to a painful inventory correction for the company.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Wood gained prominence for her investment calls on companies like Tesla, Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM), and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), leading to a surge in Ark's assets, peaking at over $60 billion in early 2021.\n\nHowever, the ARK Innovation ETF, now valued at around $6.4 billion, has declined nearly 16% this year, with Tesla's stock losing nearly 30% of its value. Despite this, the fund outperformed benchmarks last year with a 68% gain, driven by expectations of peaked interest rates and potential rate cuts.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salesforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-driving car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Auto", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BYD Auto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Publicly_Traded", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Publicly Traded", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/moved_LYNXNPEK2I063_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629044", "eventUri": "eng-9629044", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 1044, "textEnd": 1050}], "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

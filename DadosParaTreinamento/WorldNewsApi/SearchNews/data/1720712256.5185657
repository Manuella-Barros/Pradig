Richie Murphy's side came out on the wrong end of a 43-20 loss at Aviva Stadium as their season came to a crushing halt in Dublin. They trailed 17-0 at the break, but Ferris believes that deficit should have been cut following a contentious moment just before half-time.

Former Ulster and Ireland star Ferris told Premier Sports: \"It has to be a penalty try. If he (Doris) doesn't come in there on Rob Herring then Rob is going over. It is a penalty try and a yellow card all day long. \"I am not sure what (referee) Andrew Brace is doing. It is a professional foul, Doris knows exactly what he's doing. he is creeping up and actually changes binding and goes over the top. For me Ulster can feel very aggrieved they didn't get more out of that.\" Former Scotland international John Barclay agreed with Ferris, adding: \"I think it should have been a penalty try. I think Caelan Doris comes round the side. \"I am so surprised it wasn't at least a yellow card, and if it is a yellow then it has to be a penalty try. I just think Leinster got away with one.\" Reflecting on the game, Ferris said: \"They stood up and threw everything at Leinster. But any time Ulster closed the gap, Leinster had an answer. They went up the other end of the pitch and held onto the ball really well. \"Leinster were just that 10 per cent better than Ulster today. It was a really intense, high quality game.

(Representative image)\n\nThe Bombay High Court, asserting that the issue concerns \"overwhelming public interest,\" on Monday put on hold the Maharashtra government's decision declaring that private schools within a 1 km radius of government-run schools would no longer be obligated to admit children under the 25 per cent quota stipulated by the Right to Education (RTE) Act.\n\nChief Justice DK Upadhyaya and Justice Arif Doctor, presiding over the bench, noted that the amended provisions were impeding children's right to receive free elementary education.\n\n\"We are of the prima facie opinion that provisos are ultra vires to the provisions of the RTE Act. Even otherwise, by appending the provisos to the Maharashtra Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, the right of children to obtain free elementary education is being impeded, which is otherwise guaranteed under the RTE Act. Due to overwhelming public interest, we provide that the amendment notified on February 9 shall remain stayed till further orders,\" the bench stated.\n\nThe court instructed the state government pleader to submit an affidavit addressing the grounds raised in the petition and scheduled a hearing on the matter for June 12, 2024.\n\nThe petition was filed by Aswini Kamble, challenging the notification amending rules under the RTE Act by the Maharashtra government, which exempted private schools within a 1-km radius of government-run schools from admitting children under the RTE quota.\n\nKamble sought interim relief due to pending admissions to schools from May 10, 2024.\n\nBefore the amendment, the RTE Act mandated all unaided and private schools to reserve 25 per cent of entry-level seats for children from socio-economically backward sections to ensure free and compulsory education for children aged between 6 and 14 years, with the government reimbursing the schools for the fees.\n\nThe February 9 gazette notification added a proviso to the State RTE Rules:\n\n\"Provided that the local authority shall not identify the private unaided school, for the purposes of 25% admission of disadvantaged groups and weaker sections under the 2013 Rules where government schools and aided schools are situated within a one-kilometre radius of that school,\" the notification reads.\n\nIt further clarified that if no aided or government schools were located within an area, private schools would be identified for admissions under RTE and eligible for fee reimbursement.\n\nKamble's lawyer, Gayatri Singh, argued that the amendments violated Articles 14, 21, and 21A of the Constitution as well as the RTE Act.\n\nIn opposition, additional government pleader Jyoti Chavan argued that the exclusion was not absolute, contending that the provisos applied only to unaided private schools situated within an area where government or aided schools were located within a kilometre of private schools. Whereas, Chavan argued that this amendment aimed to ensure that the burden of elementary education is borne by government schools.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bombay High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Maharashtra", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of Maharashtra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Private school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_vires", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ultra vires"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_facie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prima facie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right to education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Compulsory education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School_Meals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School Meals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/rte-act--right-to-education-act-061305498-16x9_0.jpeg?VersionId=KbElgJCcSHx6DkwPyh4baAohDw1D1Udb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542807", "eventUri": "eng-9542807", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 120, "textEnd": 127}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-09", "textStart": 1108, "textEnd": 1118, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-06-", "textStart": 1341, "textEnd": 1348}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-05-", "textStart": 1686, "textEnd": 1692}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Exclusion of such schools from the mandate was not permissible.\n\nAdditional government pleader Jyoti Chavan opposed the petitions, contending that the exclusion was not absolute and was limited only to the private unaided schools situated within 1-km radius of the government or aided schools.\n\nShe added that Section 6 of the RTE Act mandated the government to set up schools wherever unavailable and where such schools are provided by the government, privately managed un-aided schools were excluded from the quota mandate, as ultimately the government has to bear the financial burden of their fees.\n\nThe argument, however, failed to impress the bench. The court instead accepted the argument of the petitioners, and stayed the amendment till further orders, as admissions to schools are set to start from May 10.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_bench", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Division bench"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_facie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prima facie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_and_secondary_legislation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primary and secondary legislation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_vires", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ultra vires"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right to life"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School_Meals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School Meals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/1600x900.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542807", "eventUri": "eng-9542807", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-09", "textStart": 1279, "textEnd": 1289}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 3125, "textEnd": 3131}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

Before Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Kerala diluted private schools' obligations under the RTE Act.\n\n\"It is a settled principle of law that any piece of subordinate legislation cannot be made in contravention of the principal Act itself,\" the bench noted.\n\n\"Even otherwise, by adding impugned provisions, the right of children to get elementary education is being hampered, which is otherwise guaranteed in Article 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) of the Constitution,\" it added.\n\nThe bench granted interim relief in a batch of pleas, including a writ petition by 17 people, including members of management of aided schools and parents from socio-economically backward classes.\n\nAppearing for the petitioners, senior advocate Gayatri Singh argued that the notification be stayed as it was contrary to the RTE Act that provides quota at municipal schools, aided schools and private unaided schools.\n\nDue to the government's decision, many needy students are unable to seek admission, she added. While around 500,000 students applied through RTE last year, fewer than 50,000 students have applied so far this year, she said.\n\nOn April 29, the state government informed the high court that the last date for submitting online applications for admissions under the RTE Act would be extended from April 30 to May 10.\n\nOn Monday, the petitioners urged that an interim stay be granted in the matter because of impending admissions to be made in school starting May 10.\n\nThe petitioners argued that the amendment was not only unconstitutional, being violative of Articles 14 (equality before law) and 21 of the Constitution, but was also in contravention of the principal Act of 2009, under which rules were formulated. They added that various high courts, such as Allahabad High Court, had stuck down similar amendments made by respective state governments.\n\nThe petitioners argued that newly added rules excluded private unaided schools while the 2009 law mandated they to be included and therefore same was not permissible\n\nHowever, Additional Government Pleader Jyoti Chavan for the state argued that exclusion applied only to certain unaided schools and was 'not absolute' as the government or local authority has established schools within a one-kilometre radius of such private unaided schools.\n\nThe bench had said everyone is bound by the mandate under the 2009 law for 25 per cent reservation in admission in Class 1 to children belonging to weaker sections. Therefore, prima facie, the rule cannot be amended on the ground that sufficient numbers of government schools are available in the concerned area.\n\n\"Thus, having regard to overwhelming public interest in matter, till further orders, amendment shall remain stayed,\" the bench held.

The point to be specified is that as per the stayed notification, it should not be misconstrued that these institutes will be exempted from the quota provision of the RTE Act.\n\nThe HC was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) petition by NGO Vidhayak Bharti, challenging the circulars issued by the government on March 6 and April 9 under the amended RTE Act. The March 6 circular issued by the Directorate of Primary Education asked certain schools to come forward and enroll themselves to reserve 25% seats - for fresh admissions on the basis of the provisions of the amended Act.\n\n\"This has led to a situation, where schools, which are mandated to reserve seats as per the RTE Act, have been directed to follow the quota rule. Thus adding into the category of schools who would otherwise provide elementary education as per Section 12(1)(c) of the RTE Act,\" the PIL read.\n\nSimilarly, the April 9 circular, asks parents to provide a preference list on the basis of which admissions would be granted to students applying for 25% quota. Seeking quashing of the circulars, the PIL states that they are ultra vires and violate constitutional rights.\n\nTerming the circulars as arbitrary, the plea contends that it creates a new class of schools which are exempt from RTE Act.

confined only to self-financed schools, police welfare schools (unaided) and self funded schools run by municipal corporations.\n\nThe students admitted under 25 per cent RTE quota are given fee concessions, and the state government reimburses private unaided schools for the same.\n\nThis comes a day after the court, through an interim order, had stayed the operation of the rule that exempted private unaided schools from 25 per cent reservation for class 1 admissions for students from weaker sections and disadvantaged groups.\n\nOn Monday, a division bench of Chief Justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya and Justice Arif S Doctor had stayed until further orders the operation of the February 9 notification of the Maharashtra government.\n\nThe said notification had exempted private schools within a one-kilometre radius of government or aided schools from Right to Education (RTE) Act quota admissions.\n\nMaintaining that the matter contained \"overwhelming public interest,\" the bench had held that the impugned amendments contravened the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, also known as the RTE.\n\nOn Tuesday, the bench was hearing a PIL by NGO Vidhayak Bharati and one Santosh Shinde, which challenged circulars or communications issued by the government on March 6 and April 3 to implement its February 9 notification.\n\nThe petitioners through advocate Swanand Ganoo claimed that the impugned circulars required aided government schools to register as being available for 25 per cent reservation even though they were not eligible to give such admissions as they already provide free primary education.\n\nAdditional Government Pleader (AGP) Jyoti Chavan for the state government, however, submitted that the petitioners' apprehension was not appropriate as the department, through impugned circular had merely sought some information from the aided schools.\n\nAGP Chavan further made submissions based on instructions from Ramdas Dhumal, Desk Officer, School Education who was present in the court.\n\nShe said that the March 6 circular, in light of May 6 interim order of HC, shall be construed only to mean that 25 per cent reservation for the children from economically weaker and disadvantaged sections of the society shall be confined to self-financed schools, police welfare (unaided) schools and self-financed schools run by municipal corporations.\n\nThe same will not apply to any other category of school mentioned in March 6 circular, she added.\n\nChavan added that the April 3 circular related to implementation of the amended rule will be modified in view of the interim order of the court and a fresh circular will be issued in due course.\n\nThe court issued notice to respondent authorities in the PIL seeking their affidavits in reply and posted further hearing to June 12, this year.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri":

According to the Act, all unaided private schools were required to reserve 25 percent of seats at the entry level for children from economically weaker and disadvantaged sections. It was the responsibility of the state government to pay the schools their tuition fees. However, the Maharashtra government tried to be too clever by half when it exempted private unaided schools situated within a one-kilometre radius from a government-run school from reserving 25 percent of seats for poor children. What's worse, the students had to apply to the government, which would admit a student only to a government school if there was such a school within a kilometre of his residence.\n\nParents knew that their children could go directly to a government school for admission, instead of waiting for the government's decision. Small wonder that there has been a drastic fall in the number of students applying for admission through this process. No doubt, the ordinance was promulgated to favour private schools that did not want to admit such students. On the government's side, it did not want to pay fees for such students. The purpose of the provision, as envisaged in the RTE Act, was to promote inclusive education. Many school managements were not willing to allow children from poor classes and backgrounds to sit with children from privileged groups. The purpose of the provision when the law was enacted in 2009 was precisely to fight this mindset.\n\nThe crux of Chief Justice DK Upadhyaya's and Justice Arif Doctor's judgment is that a subordinate law cannot take precedence over the main law, with the ordinance being subordinate to the RTE Act. It is difficult to say whether the 25 percent reservation has been a success, as many children who were admitted were unable to face the competition and dropped out. In fact, there is a strong case for strengthening the provision, instead of weakening it. Private schools that admit 25 percent of poor students and allow them to complete their education in the same schools should be recognised and honoured. Only then will the dream of inclusive education, where poor children are entitled to a level-playing field, become a reality.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_Children_to_Free_and_Compulsory_Education_Act,_2009", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eknath_Shinde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eknath Shinde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bombay High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Maharashtra", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Maharashtra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reservation in India"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School_Meals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School Meals", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2022-07/1b40bb37-591a-4e8d-8e4a-f28e3f678823/istockphoto_1146925253_612x612.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542807", "eventUri": "eng-9542807", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-09", "textStart": 107, "textEnd": 117}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

And one of the doubts now is knowing If it is more worth buying the iPad Air (M2) from 2024 or the iPad 10 launched in 2022and for that reason we are going to buy them thoroughly.\n\nThere are reasons both to buy one model and to buy another. Ultimately, the iPad 10 is Apple's cheapest entry model and the iPad Air sits right in the middle of the range. They are models that share a design, but in which we find differences. As we already saw in the comparison between the iPad 2022 and the previous iPad Air with M1 chip.\n\nAs usual, the iPad Air is superior in many of its specifications to the tenth generation iPad. Although they have an exactly identical design, with almost the same measurements, the iPad Air (M2) is superior to the iPad 10 in all of this:\n\nWe are going to Compare in depth the differences between the iPad Air (M2) and the 10th generation iPad. The iPad Air is superior in many areas but costs significantly more money, is it worth it?\n\nWe are before two iPad models that are practically identical in terms of design. Completely aluminum devices, with a single, fairly discreet rear camera and a front part dominated by a large screen that barely leaves any frames. Although the iPad Air has a slightly more compact design and that less so, in its 11-inch model:\n\nIn the screen lies one of the main differences between the iPad 10 and the iPad Air (M2), not only because the latter has a larger model that reaches 13 inches, something we do not have in the entry range. Also because of the different technologies that make this screen look better.\n\nBoth models have a screen Exactly 10.86-inch Liquid Retina display with a resolution of 2,360 x 1,640 at 264 p/panti-fingerprint oleophobic coating and True Tone, but there are other differences:\n\nDefinitely The most important difference between the iPad 10 and iPad Air (M2) and one of the main reasons to opt for one or another model. While the iPad 10 has a mobile device chip, the iPad Air uses a computer chip. This gives it amazing power that you will notice when using applications that demand performance.\n\nThese are the results that both processors obtain in the Geekbench performance test:\n\nThe M2 chip doubles, or even more, the power of the A14 Bionic chip. It is true that In the performance and fluidity of the system you will not notice too many differences. But when using powerful apps the iPad Air will perform much betterit is even compatible with apps and games that the iPad 10 cannot install.\n\nBoth models are compatible with the Apple Pencil, but not all models. We now have 4 different Apple Pencil models and each iPad is compatible with one or the other. The Apple Pencil USB-C is compatible with all iPad models, however the iPad 10 can also use the first generation Apple Pencil and the iPad Air (M2) is compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro.\n\nSomething similar happens with keyboards. He iPad 10 has its own keyboard, the Magic Keyboard FolioMeanwhile he iPad Air (M2) supports the classic Magic Keyboard which was launched a few years ago.\n\nImportant difference to assess, compared to the input models The iPad 10 is almost 300 euros cheaper than the iPad Air (M2), something that can decide the purchase for one model or another. These are the prices of each version of these two iPad models:\n\nThis is the best iPad in terms of quality-price ratio and there are many reasons to buy it rather than opting for the iPad Air, these are some of them:\n\nThe iPad Air is in the mid-range and is designed for those who from time to time will need extra power or want to use the iPad for work as well as for leisure. These would be the reasons to buy it:\n\nWe are before two iPad models that may be among the best sellers in the range. The iPad 10 is a great model for most users and the iPad Air is perfect for those who want a little more without spending what an iPad Pro costs.

But Apple has a variety of tablets for sale, and it can be confusing to decide on one. You may be considering either Apple's all-new mid-range iPad Air or the company's entry-level 10th Gen iPad. Luckily, we're here to help you choose with the ultimate iPad Air vs iPad comparison.\n\nPrice, availability, and specs\n\nMid-range vs entry level\n\nThe new iPad Air is available now at your retailer of choice, and pricing kicks off at $599. Depending on what configuration you opt for, it can go up to nearly $1500, especially if you're looking for a 13-inch model with a ton of storage. You also get four relatively understated colorways to choose from as well.\n\nApple's 10th Gen iPad is similarly available everywhere, with pricing between $349 and $649 depending on configuration. It's worth keeping in mind that you can only get 256GB of storage at most here though, which isn't a ton of space to play with. You also get four colorways with some impressively bold, vibrant options.\n\niPad Air (M2, 2024)Apple iPad 10Storage128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB64GB, 256GBCPUApple M2 (8-core CPU)Apple A14 Bionic Memory8GB LPDDR54GB RAM Operating SystemiPadOS 17.5iPadOS 16Battery11-inch: 28.93Wh, 13-inch: 36.59Wh28.6 Wh lithium\u2011polymerPortsUSB-CUSB-CCamera (Rear, Front)Rear: 12MP Wide, AF, f/1.8, Front: 12MP Ultra-wide, f/2.412 MP f/1.8, 12 MP f/2.4Display type11-inch: LCD, 60Hz, 10.9-inch, 3:2, 2360 x 1640 resolution, 264 PPI, 13-inch: LCD, 60Hz, 12.9-inch, 3:2, 2732 x 2040 resolution, 264 PPI10.9-inch LCD, 2360 x 1640 pixels, 60Hz, 500 nitsPrice11-inch: $599, 13-inch: $799$449 (64GB), $599 (256GB)Size11-inch: 247.6 x 178.5 x 6.1mm, 13-inch: 280.6 x 214.9 x 6.1mm9.79 x 7.07 x 0.28 inches (248.6 x 179.5 x 7mm)ConnectivityWi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, optional 5G cellularWi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) with 2x2 MIMO Related Say goodbye to the iPad 9 as Apple streamlines up its tablet lineup Apple's ultra-budget and aging tablet is finally going away Related The new M2 iPad Air finally makes me want to ditch my iPad 9 My iPad 9 still works great for what I bought it for. But I feel the new M2 iPad Air could finally become the dual-purpose device I always wanted.\n\nDesign and display\n\nSimilar rectangles\n\nThese two tablets have the same design language: a sleek, minimalist design with rounded corners and no front-facing buttons. The iPad is smaller than the 13-inch model of the iPad Air, but that's the biggest difference between these tablets. Otherwise, you'd be hard-pressed to tell a difference.\n\nThe 11-inch iPad Air and the iPad have just about the same footprint in terms of weight and size. As you might expect, the larger 13-inch iPad Air is bigger and heavier than the 10.9-inch iPad at 1.36 pounds vs 1.05 pounds. Overall, they are all quite light and portable, of course.\n\nFor a display comparison, the 11-inch iPad Air and the iPad have a Liquid Retina IPS display with a 2360x1640 resolution and peak brightness of 500 nits. The 13-inch iPad Air features the same panel tech with a 2732x2048 resolution and peak brightness of 600 nits. The iPad Air also has an anti-reflective coating, while the iPad does not, and it also supports a wider range of colors than the iPad.\n\nIn general, the design is a match between these tablets, but thanks to a couple of display upgrades, as well as a larger model that gets a tad brighter, the iPad Air ultimately pulls ahead of its younger sibling, even if the gap between the two isn't especially enormous.\n\nWinner: iPad Air (M2)\n\nHardware and performance\n\nM2 or A14 Bionic\n\nThese tablets may look quite similar, but they actually have more than a few key differences.\n\nFor one, the iPad Air features Apple's M2 chip, while the iPad has the brand's A14 Bionic chip. The M2 has more CPU cores, more GPU cores, and faster clocks than the A14 Bionic, which means better performance. You also get 8GB of RAM with the iPad Air and 4GB with the iPad. As you might expect, thanks to a beefier chip and more memory, the newer iPad Air is more capable.\n\nCameras, on the other hand, are pretty much a match. Both have got a 12MP wide camera on the back and a 12MP Landscape Ultra Wide camera on the front, and both support up to 4K/60FPS recording and 3x video zoom. The only difference worth mentioning is that the iPad Air features Smart HDR 4 tech for photos, and the iPad has the last-gen version, Smart HDR 3.\n\nStorage is also handled differently. The iPad goes up to 256GB, which isn't particularly impressive for 2024. On the other hand, the iPad Air can be kitted out with up to 1TB, though you will be paying a hefty premium for the largest capacity. Nonetheless, it's nice to have the option for more storage. The iPad Air also packs in Wi-Fi 6E whereas the iPad is stuck with Wi-Fi 6.\n\nWith a more powerful chip, more RAM, more storage, and faster Wi-Fi, the iPad Air has the better hardware, hands down. Though, that isn't to say the iPad will have trouble running most apps or even casually gaming. Though, if you're looking for some premium performance, you're better off going with iPad Air and its M2 chip over the iPad.\n\nWinner: iPad Air (M2)\n\nBattery life\n\nSolid performance out of both\n\nWe haven't had a chance to formally evaluate the battery life of either iPad ourselves just yet, but Apple estimates you'll get up to 10 hours browsing the web on Wi-Fi or watching videos, and up to 9 hours when relying on cellular for both the iPad and iPad Air. Of course, your mileage may vary depending on what you're doing, like playing an especially intensive game. Besides, manufacturer estimates of battery life should always be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nThat being said, unless you have a long day of work ahead of you that you're planning on using your iPad for, you probably won't have to worry about being tethered to a charger with either one.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nOverall winner: iPad Air (M2)\n\nPay more for more\n\nIn an unsurprising turn of events, Apple's newer mid-range iPad beats out its entry level iPad. Thanks to a more capable display, more powerful hardware, more storage, and an option for a larger 13-inch model, the M2 iPad Air is a seriously impressive tablet, all things considered.\n\nThat being said, it will cost you at least hundreds more than a base iPad, which is actually quite competitive with the iPad Air if you don't plan on doing anything that demands a ton of processing power. So, if you're looking to save money, an iPad can definitely still be worth buying, and you may not even feel the difference.\n\niPad Air (M2, 2024) Winner\n\nApple's 2024 iPad Air sports the brand's powerful M2 chip alongside a new design that, for the first time, is available in two different sizes: a familiar 11-inch model and a bigger 13-inch model.

Fortunately, we've tested and reviewed all of Apple's current iPad lineup, as well as one recently-retired model that's still available for purchase from other retailers at the time of publishing.\n\nApple iPad (10th Gen)\n\nBest iPad\n\nApple\n\nIn our testing, the basic iPad provided enough speed for the productivity apps and games we love, and its screen is pretty darn good for its price.\n\nRead our review\n\n$334 at Amazon From $349 at Best Buy From $349 at Apple\n\nApple iPad Mini (6th Gen)\n\nBest iPad for reading\n\nAPPLE\n\nThis smaller iPad is ideal for those who want to curl up with a book (or website) and read to their heart's content, and it has the best battery life of any modern iPad we've tested.\n\nRead our review\n\n$499 $469 at Amazon From $499 at Best Buy From $499 at Apple\n\nApple iPad Air (M2)\n\nBest iPad upgrade for creators\n\nApple\n\nWe've seen that the iPad Air's M2 chip provides a serious speed boost, and if you combine that with the Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard you can speed through work while adding extra flourishes of style to your projects.\n\nRead our review\n\n$599 $570 at Amazon From $599 at Best Buy From $599 at Apple\n\nApple iPad Pro (M4)\n\nBest splurge iPad\n\nApple\n\nThe best screen we've ever seen in an iPad would probably be enough for some people, but the iPad Pro is also the fastest tablet under the sun (with better battery life than the M2 iPad Air).\n\nRead our review\n\n$999 at Amazon From $999 at Best Buy From $999 at Apple\n\nBest iPad: Apple iPad (10th Gen)\n\nMike Andronico/CNN\n\nFor as much as we enjoy Apple's pricier tablets, the simple fact is that the regular iPad is the right option for most folks. Through 10 iterations, Apple's gradual improvements have built a tablet that's better than most, with a screen and CPU that will be great for all the general needs. Thanks to a recent price drop, the latest regular iPad now starts at $349, hundreds less than the iPad Air, and nearly a third as much as the iPad Pro. It also offers all the same iPhone and other Apple integrations that the other iPads do, including Universal Control for use with MacBooks.\n\nThe 10th Gen iPad sports a pretty darn good 10.9-inch screen, with a bright and colorful picture quality that will make you wonder why you ever settled for screens in cheaper tablets. In our testing, it shined on everything from retro games to modern movies with questionable CGI, allowing us to see crisp detail throughout.\n\nThe entry-level iPad's Apple's A14 Bionic chip delivered brisk performance across a ton of apps. Whether we were testing the programs we rely on in everyday work such as Slack and Outlook, or streaming services such as Netflix and Sling, it all just worked smoothly.\n\nThe regular iPad also features a USB-C port, as it's no longer stuck in the past with the old Lightning connector. That means you can charge it with the same cables used for many other gadgets, such as the iPhone 15 and MacBook Air. This is also the first regular iPad that features optional 5G wireless connectivity for those spaces where Wi-Fi doesn't follow, which brings it up to pace with all of Apple's other current tablets.\n\nAlso, the basic iPad's front-facing webcam is finally -- just like the iPad Air and iPad Pro -- in the correct spot, centered on the longer side. This way, you're properly framed by default if you use the iPad in landscape mode, docked in a keyboard case. That's just one of many little changes that helps us recommend the 10th Gen iPad to most friends and family.\n\nOne last thing: the more-expensive iPads could learn a thing or two from the regular iPad when it comes to color, as this model is sold in bright blue, pink and yellow hues, in addition to the restrained and subdued silver. This is in stark contrast to the drab and muted color options that the iPad Air and Pro are sold in.\n\nBest iPad for reading: Apple iPad mini (6th Gen)\n\nJacob Krol/CNN\n\nSlightly pricier than the regular iPad, the 8.3-inch iPad mini may seem a bit oddly positioned in Apple's lineup. Sure, you're getting less screen for your buck, but that's the point for many folks. Not only will the iPad mini fit easier inside the pockets of a small bag or purse or on a crowded bedside table, but it's just simpler to hold.\n\nYes, we love how the iPad mini has the perfect form factor for reading books of all kinds (the best e-readers aren't for everyone), as this smaller and lighter iPad is easier to use in one hand. You'll also love how long the iPad mini lasts on a single charge, as its battery test time eclipsed 10 hours of 4K video playback -- setting the record for the current class of iPads.\n\nThe perks of going smaller don't end there, though, as the iPad mini's display is more colorful. While the regular iPad covers the standard sRGB color gamut, the iPad mini upgrades everything on your screen to the wider DCI-P3 standard. The iPad mini will also be better outside, as its anti-reflective coating should help you see what you're tapping.\n\nThe iPad mini also rocks a slightly faster processor, as its A15 Bionic chip is the next step up from the 10th Gen iPad's A14 chip. It's not the biggest difference-maker, but it's one way to explain paying more for less screen space.\n\nBest iPad upgrade for creators: Apple iPad Air (M2)\n\nHenry T. Casey/CNN Underscored\n\nThe 2024 iPad Air continues the tradition of bringing features once exclusive to the iPad Pro to a wider audience, thanks to a lower price. This iPad runs on the M2 chip, the same chip that we loved in the speedy 2022 iPad Pro, and it can run creative professional applications such as the iPad versions of Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro smoothly. It can also handle games with higher system requirements, including the Resident Evil 4 remake and Death Stranding's Director's Cut.\n\nUnlike the iPad and iPad mini, the iPad Air supports two of Apple's premium accessories that make it a workhorse for creators. First and foremost, it works with the Apple Pencil Pro, where you get the squeeze and barrel roll gestures that make the stylus more like a magic wand with useful menus and stylistic flourishes. There's also the Magic Keyboard, which makes the iPad Air feel more like a futuristic laptop where its screen looks like it floats in the air. Its keys are a joy to click and type on, as I learned while putting together sections of this guide.\n\nFilm editors (and digital hoarders) will also appreciate that it starts with 128GB of storage, twice as much space as the regular iPad. The iPad Air's battery life also beat the iPad on our test, where we play a looping 4K video at 50% brightness, lasting more than six hours compared to the regular iPad's five.\n\nLastly, the iPad Air might be perfect for you if you think the regular iPad's 10.9-inch screen isn't big enough, as Apple now sells a 13-inch version alongside the 11-inch model.\n\nBest splurge iPad: Apple iPad Pro (M4)\n\nMike Andronico/CNN Underscored\n\nWith each update, Apple's iPad Pro keeps the title of the best tablet that we've ever tested, provided you have the cash. That's especially true with the latest model that runs on the M4 chip, which makes it faster than the M2 iPad Air while also adding GPU tricks including hardware-based ray tracing and mesh shading to make top games look even better. But performance isn't the only reason you would invest $999 or more on the iPad Pro.\n\nI absolutely love the 2024 iPad Pro's Ultra Retina XDR display, as this gorgeous screen makes movies, TV and photos look fantastic with high contrast, strong color and tremendous amounts of detail. Apple achieved this by stacking two OLED panels on top of each other -- because as great as OLED's color and contrast is, it isn't known for the brightness that the previous iPad Pros offered.\n\nOnce you get your hands on the new iPad Pro, you might be surprised to hear it packs that double-stuffed display, as it's also thinner and lighter than before. Heck, it's even thinner and lighter than the iPad Air. Somehow, Apple's also packed impressively strong audio quality into this thin design, including more bass than you'd expect.\n\nThe iPad Pro with M4 is also the only Apple tablet to work with its latest Magic Keyboard, which takes the previous floating screen design and adds an aluminum palm rest, larger touchpad with haptic feedback and a row of function keys so you can control brightness, volume, and media playback (though that's also in cheaper alternatives). And while it shares Apple Pencil Pro support with the iPad Air M2, it also packs more battery life, lasting almost an hour longer on our battery test than its more affordable sibling.\n\nHow to choose the right iPad for you\n\nIf you're coming into this choice with no real opinions about what iPad you want, the 10th Gen iPad is probably the tablet for you. It's the right iPad for when you just want to use touchscreen apps on a nice screen that's bigger than your iPhone, doing everything from reading to streaming, either on the go or the sofa. Regular productivity apps work well too, and it's the most affordable of the pack by at least $150.\n\nMike Andronico/CNN Underscored\n\nStorage: Choosing a storage size is one of the biggest decisions you'll make during checkout. Both the basic iPad 10th Gen and the iPad mini 6th Gen start at 64GB and then go up to 256GB. If you want to edit big video files, see yourself downloading a lot of TV shows or movies for trips, or you know your favorite apps include games with substantial downloads required, you should probably go for 256GB, as 64GB can fill up really quickly. The iPad Air and Pro start at 128GB and 256GB, respectively, so there's less reason to be concerned about that at checkout.\n\nThe iPad Air M2 (left) is thicker and heavier than the iPad Pro M4 (right).\n\nHenry T. Casey/CNN Underscored\n\nSize: The 8.3-inch iPad mini is best for folks who want a device that's more portable, while the regular 10.9-inch iPad is again best for most as it sits in the middle of the lineup in size. The iPad Air is best for the people who have already found that the basic iPad doesn't go fast enough -- or want a larger screen, as it comes in both 11-inch and 13-inch sizes. The iPad Pro is also sold in those two sizes, though it's thinner and lighter than the new iPad Air.\n\nProcessor: Most folks who want an iPad will be properly served by either the iPad's A14 chip or the iPad mini's A15 Bionic, as both of which enable decent performance and multitasking. You only need to consider the iPad Air with its M2 or the iPad Pro's M4 if you know you want the power of Apple's desktop-class chips to shred through video editing, music production, high-end gaming and more tricky tasks.\n\nMike Andronico/CNN Underscored\n\nScreen: The display panels in the iPad 10th Gen, iPad mini and iPad Air are more alike than they differ, though the iPad mini and iPad Air are slightly more colorful and offer anti-reflective coating for those battling glare. The iPad Pro's OLED-based Ultra Retina XDR screen, though, offers the top picture quality with excellent contrast and true inky black tones. It's so good that you might want to avoid looking at it unless you are ready to throw down for that big investment.\n\nHow we tested\n\nHenry T. Casey/CNN Underscored\n\niPads have a lot of similarities, as only select iPadOS features such as Stage Manager are only available on the iPad Air and iPad Pro. So when it comes time to testing and reviewing iPads, we get hyper-specific about how they perform and figuring out if the pricier iPads are worth it.\n\nDesign\n\nLook and feel: iPads may share a design language, but they vary in size and heft from the 8.3-inch mini to the 13-inch iPad Air and iPad Pro. So we pay close attention to what it's like to use these tablets, and how comfortable they are in our hands. Accessories: Since all iPads have unified under the USB-C standard, we take into consideration which of Apple's excellent accessories are supported.\n\nDisplay\n\nPicture quality: We watch a variety of content on each iPad, ranging from animation to live action, to see how sharp and colorful these screens are. Brightness: iPads aren't meant to only be used indoors, so we take into consideration how bright these screens get so you can actually see what you're looking at when you're outside.\n\nPerformance\n\nBenchmarks: In addition to seeing how smoothly these iPads run various productivity applications and games, we run benchmark tests such as Geekbench to get hard numbers that make it easy to compare their speeds. Battery life: After charging an iPad to 100% and turning off Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and automatic brightness, we turn the display brightness to 50% and time how long it takes for a looping 4K video to bring the iPad's charge to empty.\n\nSoftware\n\nMultitasking: iPads are nearly identical in features, but the more you spend on one, the more you might expect it to offer on multitasking and how it can offer a laptop-like experience. So, we continue to check how iPadOS matures as a platform for folks looking to do more than basic work. Special features: Every year brings new special features such as Center Stage and Stage Manager, so we test all of the latest hyped-up tricks to see how much they add.\n\nApple Pencil, keyboard and case compatibility guide\n\nOnce you've chosen an iPad, you'll probably want to pick the right accessories -- though many aren't compatible with all iPads.\n\nMike Andronico/CNN\n\nAccessorizing the entry-level 10th Gen iPad with excellent input options is simple, and starts with Apple's Magic Keyboard Folio case. This case uses a kickstand for adjustable viewing angles, but if that $249 option is too pricey, Logitech offers a $160 version, the Combo Touch detachable keyboard case. Apple also makes a $79 Smart Folio for iPad case, which folds into its own stand. For your stylus, go with the $99 Apple Pencil (1st Gen) if you want pressure sensitivity, though charging it is a little clumsy thanks to its included USB-C adapter. The easier option is the $79 Apple Pencil with USB-C, which also lets you preview what your stylus is about to do with its Hover feature.\n\nFor the iPad mini (6th Gen), you can go with either the Apple Pencil with USB-C or the $129 Apple Pencil (2nd Gen). The latter attaches and charges magnetically on the iPad mini's longer side, and it supports Apple's own double-tap feature for switching the tool you're using, pressure sensitivity so you can make bigger marks with deeper presses and the hover trick that lets you preview the digital mark you're about to make. There are no good keyboard cases for the iPad mini because it's so small that the keys would be too tightly scrunched in, so pick one of the best keyboards that offers Bluetooth connections. If you want a case that doubles as a stand, the $59 Smart Folio for iPad mini should do the trick.\n\nMike Andronico/CNN Underscored\n\nThe iPad Air M2 and iPad Pro M4 have the same stylus options: the $129 Apple Pencil Pro and the aforementioned USB-C Apple Pencil. For your extra $50, the Pencil Pro gives you the new squeeze, Barrel Roll and Find My support, and it also attaches and charges magnetically on one of the longer sides of the tablet. The USB-C Apple Pencil is attached to the side of the iPad Air, but it needs to be charged via a cable.\n\nHenry T. Casey/CNN Underscored\n\nFor typing on the iPad Air M2, you'll probably want the Magic Keyboard, which uses magnets to make it look like your tablet is floating in mid-air. But since that starts at $299, you may want to save $100 with the slightly-less-fancy $200 Logitech Combo Touch Keyboard case for the M2 Air. The latest iPad Air is also compatible with the previous Magic Keyboards for iPad Air and iPad Pro. Again, if you don't need a keyboard, the $79 Smart Folio for iPad Air offers both protection and operates as its own stand.\n\nHenry T. Casey/CNN Underscored\n\nAs for iPad Pro M4 keyboards, you can either go big with Apple's aluminum-laden Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro, which starts at $299 or save with Logitech's $230 Combo Touch Keyboard case. The former gets you a metallic wrist rest and that nifty design where your iPad practically floats, and both give you a row of function keys at the top of your keyboard. For those who just want a case and stand, there's also the $79 Smart Folio for iPad Pro.\n\nOther iPads we tested\n\nCNN Underscored has been testing iPads for years, so we've seen many of Apple's tablets, including previous iPad Airs and iPad Pros, come and go. There's only one that didn't make our top picks that's still available online, though.\n\niPad (9th Gen)\n\n$249 at Amazon\n\nApple's previous basic iPad sat at the top of our best tablets list for years, but its chunkier bezel, aging design and Lightning port made it a prime candidate to be killed off for the 10th Gen iPad. But when it's available at this low price at other retailers at the moment, it's hard to argue against for folks on a budget. Those trying to move completely over to USB-C, though, may draw a line in the sand over this one.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "henry_t_casey@cnn.com", "name": "Henry T.

Apple makes some of the best tablets, so as long as you can afford the one you select, you'll probably be happy with that buying decision. That said, myself and others keep using the word \"overkill\" when talking about the top iPads, so I thought it was a good time to write the ultimate shopping guide for Apple's tablets.

Somehow, Apple's also packed impressively strong audio quality into this thin design, including more bass than you'd expect.\n\nThe iPad Pro with M4 is also the only Apple tablet to work with its latest Magic Keyboard, which takes the previous floating screen design and adds an aluminum palm rest, larger touchpad with haptic feedback and a row of function keys so you can control brightness, volume, and media playback (though that's also in cheaper alternatives). And while it shares Apple Pencil Pro support with the iPad Air M2, it also packs more battery life, lasting almost an hour longer on our battery test than its more affordable sibling.\n\nIf you're coming into this choice with no real opinions about what iPad you want, the 10th Gen iPad is probably the tablet for you. It's the right iPad for when you just want to use touchscreen apps on a nice screen that's bigger than your iPhone, doing everything from reading to streaming, either on the go or the sofa. Regular productivity apps work well too, and it's the most affordable of the pack by at least $150.\n\nStorage: Choosing a storage size is one of the biggest decisions you'll make during checkout. Both the basic iPad 10th Gen and the iPad mini 6th Gen start at 64GB and then go up to 256GB. If you want to edit big video files, see yourself downloading a lot of TV shows or movies for trips, or you know your favorite apps include games with substantial downloads required, you should probably go for 256GB, as 64GB can fill up really quickly. The iPad Air and Pro start at 128GB and 256GB, respectively, so there's less reason to be concerned about that at checkout.\n\nSize: The 8.3-inch iPad mini is best for folks who want a device that's more portable, while the regular 10.9-inch iPad is again best for most as it sits in the middle of the lineup in size. The iPad Air is best for the people who have already found that the basic iPad doesn't go fast enough -- or want a larger screen, as it comes in both 11-inch and 13-inch sizes. The iPad Pro is also sold in those two sizes, though it's thinner and lighter than the new iPad Air.\n\nProcessor: Most folks who want an iPad will be properly served by either the iPad's A14 chip or the iPad mini's A15 Bionic, as both of which enable decent performance and multitasking. You only need to consider the iPad Air with its M2 or the iPad Pro's M4 if you know you want the power of Apple's desktop-class chips to shred through video editing, music production, high-end gaming and more tricky tasks.\n\nScreen: The display panels in the iPad 10th Gen, iPad mini and iPad Air are more alike than they differ, though the iPad mini and iPad Air are slightly more colorful and offer anti-reflective coating for those battling glare. The iPad Pro's OLED-based Ultra Retina XDR screen, though, offers the top picture quality with excellent contrast and true inky black tones. It's so good that you might want to avoid looking at it unless you are ready to throw down for that big investment.\n\niPads have a lot of similarities, as only select iPadOS features such as Stage Manager are only available on the iPad Air and iPad Pro. So when it comes time to testing and reviewing iPads, we get hyper-specific about how they perform and figuring out if the pricier iPads are worth it.\n\nOnce you've chosen an iPad, you'll probably want to pick the right accessories -- though many aren't compatible with all iPads.\n\nAccessorizing the entry-level 10th Gen iPad with excellent input options is simple, and starts with Apple's Magic Keyboard Folio case. This case uses a kickstand for adjustable viewing angles, but if that $249 option is too pricey, Logitech offers a $160 version, the Combo Touch detachable keyboard case. Apple also makes a $79 Smart Folio for iPad case, which folds into its own stand. For your stylus, go with the $99 Apple Pencil (1st Gen) if you want pressure sensitivity, though charging it is a little clumsy thanks to its included USB-C adapter. The easier option is the $79 Apple Pencil with USB-C, which also lets you preview what your stylus is about to do with its Hover feature.\n\nFor the iPad mini (6th Gen), you can go with either the Apple Pencil with USB-C or the $129 Apple Pencil (2nd Gen). The latter attaches and charges magnetically on the iPad mini's longer side, and it supports Apple's own double-tap feature for switching the tool you're using, pressure sensitivity so you can make bigger marks with deeper presses and the hover trick that lets you preview the digital mark you're about to make. There are no good keyboard cases for the iPad mini because it's so small that the keys would be too tightly scrunched in, so pick one of the best keyboards that offers Bluetooth connections. If you want a case that doubles as a stand, the $59 Smart Folio for iPad mini should do the trick.\n\nThe iPad Air M2 and iPad Pro M4 have the same stylus options: the $129 Apple Pencil Pro and the aforementioned USB-C Apple Pencil. For your extra $50, the Pencil Pro gives you the new squeeze, Barrel Roll and Find My support, and it also attaches and charges magnetically on one of the longer sides of the tablet. The USB-C Apple Pencil is attached to the side of the iPad Air, but it needs to be charged via a cable.\n\nFor typing on the iPad Air M2, you'll probably want the Magic Keyboard, which uses magnets to make it look like your tablet is floating in mid-air. But since that starts at $299, you may want to save $100 with the slightly-less-fancy $200 Logitech Combo Touch Keyboard case for the M2 Air. The latest iPad Air is also compatible with the previous Magic Keyboards for iPad Air and iPad Pro. Again, if you don't need a keyboard, the $79 Smart Folio for iPad Air offers both protection and operates as its own stand.\n\nAs for iPad Pro M4 keyboards, you can either go big with Apple's aluminum-laden Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro, which starts at $299 or save with Logitech's $230 Combo Touch Keyboard case. The former gets you a metallic wrist rest and that nifty design where your iPad practically floats, and both give you a row of function keys at the top of your keyboard. For those who just want a case and stand, there's also the $79 Smart Folio for iPad Pro.\n\nCNN Underscored has been testing iPads for years, so we've seen many of Apple's tablets, including previous iPad Airs and iPad Pros, come and go. There's only one that didn't make our top picks that's still available online, though.\n\nApple's previous basic iPad sat at the top of our best tablets list for years, but its chunkier bezel, aging design and Lightning port made it a prime candidate to be killed off for the 10th Gen iPad. But when it's available at this low price at other retailers at the moment, it's hard to argue against for folks on a budget. Those trying to move completely over to USB-C, though, may draw a line in the sand over this one.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Mini", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Mini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A14", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple A14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Universal Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wireless network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Outlook", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Outlook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Webcam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logitech", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logitech"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_commerce_articles_689/f5b91b59be28a8fc9c13e28da113f342", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9589826", "eventUri": "eng-9589826", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

It also revealed a new iPad Air, but that was decidedly less exciting.\n\nThat's because it's essentially the same as the M1 version that we've had for a while, except it's getting a larger version and the M2 chip that's been around for two years.\n\nPerhaps the best thing about the arrival of an underwhelming new model is that the iPad Air with M1, which we called \"the ultimate student tablet\" in our glowing iPad Air M1 review, is now seeing significant price cuts.\n\nIn fact, you can now save $200 off of the tablet at both Amazon and Walmart, bringing it down to just $399.\n\nThe iPad Air has a big, bright 10.9-inch display that makes it big enough for just about anything while also being just the right size to hold with one hand -- ideal for reading books.\n\nWhile the Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard add an extra cost, even without them iPadOS is really coming into its own, with improved multitasking features and gestures. And, there's Bluetooth mouse and keyboard support anyway.\n\nBattery life is good, too, and the M1 chip inside is the same that's found on some Apple laptops, plus the USB-C connection means you can hook up a variety of peripherals.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nWe dubbed the iPad Air M1 the best iPad for students, and we still stand by it -- especially at this price.\n\nImage 1 of 4\n\nKey features: Portable, big display, 64GB of storage and USB-C connectivity.\n\nPrice history: We've seen around $100 off this iPad before, but this discount is a new low for the M1 model.\n\nPrice comparison: While Walmart and Amazon duke it out, Target still offers the M1 iPad Air at full price - despite stocking the M2 for 99 cents less.\n\nReviews consensus: Despite the M1 chip being a few years old now, it's still powerful, and energy-efficient enough, to power just about anything you can do on an iPad.

Well, some new data has revealed what most iPad owners do in that situation - and surprisingly, the vast majority hang onto their Apple slates.\n\nA new report from the Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), which tracks the behavior of repeat iPad buyers in the twelve months up to the end of March 2024, reveals that a whopping 67% of iPad owners kept their old tablet rather than trading them in.\n\nWithin that 67% group, the report found that 31% gave their old iPad to a friend or family member, highlighting the longevity of Apple's tablets and their potential for reuse. That's also very different from iPhone owners - in the same period, only 11% of iPhone owners gave their old phones to family or friends.\n\nThe other big difference between iPad and iPhone owners is the number who trade in their old device when upgrading. For iPad owners, just 6% take advantage of Apple Trade In or other resale sites, compared to 42% of iPhone upgraders.\n\nThis suggests that iPad owners are holding onto their devices for longer, leaving them with a negligible resale value. Or it simply shows that you can do more with an old iPad than you can with an iPhone.\n\nWhile most iPad owners either kept their tablet or treated it as a hand-me-down, a significant chunk (23%) were also forced to upgrade because their iPad was either lost, stolen, or broken. That's a slight surprise given that the equivalent figure for iPhone owners is just 6%, but iPads do have more screen real estate for you to crack or break accidentally.\n\nIf 67% of iPad owners keep or pass their old tablet on to friends and family, what exactly are they doing with them?\n\nFor many, old iPads will simply become travel TVs, gaming devices, or e-readers. Or if they're really old models, others may sadly become expensive drinks trays. The original iPad Air, for example, may still look relatively modern for a ten-year-old tablet, but Apple stopped supporting it in 2019. It's stuck on iOS 12, which most app developers subsequently stopped supporting.\n\nBut if you have a more recent iPad, you can do more interesting and creative things with it. One option is to turn your iPad into a digital photo frame, which can be achieved by fiddling with its settings (for example, switching the 'Auto-Lock' mode to 'Never') and using the Photos app.\n\nIf you do want to continue using an old iPad, it's important to keep an eye out for important security updates, as Apple still occasionally pushes out patches for devices that are close to a decade old.\n\nBut whether you're buying one of the best iPads new or keeping an eye out for second-hand iPad Pro bargains, there's certainly a lot you can do with your old tablet. Another popular option is turning it into a digital recipe book (with added Facetime) for your kitchen.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_wilson@techradar.com", "name": "Mark Wilson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_12", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IOS 12"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_(1st_generation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad (1st generation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FaceTime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3NRUuAavEuGHEwnxGTqA5c-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9589826", "eventUri": "eng-9589826", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

The iPad Air has always been positioned in the middle of the wide range of iPads that you can buy and now you have the opportunity to get the model with the M1 chip at a very low price.\n\nHe iPad Air with M1 chip is an excellent optionperhaps the best of all, since after the launch of the new generation of iPad Air of 2024 its price has fallen to a minimum. And taking into account that the only difference is the internal chip, and that the M1 offers less than enough power, it is a historic opportunity.\n\nAt this moment the iPad Air with M1 chip costs only 598 euros, when until a few days ago its official price was 769 euros. Is a very good price for this iPad modelwhich has great specs and incredible performance free of the power of this Apple chip.\n\nThis same iPad model has a price of 639 euros at MediaMarkt and 609 euros in PCComponents. Which tells us that Amazon's offer is very interesting.\n\nThe iPad Air is a tablet intended for users who occasionally They are going to need extra power to use a professional app or play a demanding gamelike Resident Evil 4 or Assassin's Creed Mirage, games that require the power of an M series chip and cannot be played on many iPads.\n\nHe iPad Air has a very careful design with a large screen of almost 11 inches and is capable of running iPadOS 17 perfectly. An iPad that will also stand the test of time very well and has years of updates left. It has always been an interesting option and at this price even more so.\n\nBy For only 598 euros you can take home a fantastic iPad that will not disappoint you. A perfect device for leisure and with which you can also work, since it has the power of a MacBook. A great option for any type of user.\n\nThis iPad Air can boast of great specifications that are further enhanced by the powerful M1 chip.

As technology enthusiasts rush to upgrade their devices, many owners of older iPad models are finding ways to take advantage of their tablets before purchasing a new model.\n\nAccording to the results of a research published by CIRP, Users play with six options when it comes to what to do with their old iPad. To put the decisions in perspective, the compared to what iPhone owners do with their previous mobile when they upgrade to a new generation.\n\nAccording to the report in the year ending March 2024, 67% of regular iPad buyers chose to give their iPad to a family member or friend or keep it. While sOnly 41% of iPhone buyers kept or gave away their old iPhone to an acquaintance.\n\nThis indicates that older iPads are still quite functional and practical, so replacing them, even for A new model with improved features is not always as tempting as it is in the iPhone market.\n\nThe study showed the trend that the 23% of iPad users made a replacement purchase due to loss, theft or damage to their previous device. This only happens to 6% of repeat iPhone buyers.\n\nStill There is a notable difference in upgrade motivations between iPad and iPhone users. While iPhone owners tend to reach for the latest model as an internalized desire, iPad users tend to replace their devices practically when necessary.\n\nThis pattern suggests that although iPads are valued for their durability and long-term functionality, Apple could benefit greatly by fostering a similar desire for continuous upgrading among iPad users. Promoting the innovations and advantages of new models could encourage users to proactively upgradethereby increasing sales and further strengthening brand loyalty.\n\nA few weeks ago Apple updated its line of tablets with the introduction of the new iPad Air models and the 2024 iPad Pro series, which in addition to having unique innovations on the market, with the thinnest screen on a device, was also accompanied of the renewal of the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil Pro.

But exactly how do the latest tablets differ from their M2-powered predecessors? Our M4 iPad Pro vs. M2 iPad Pro comparison reveals the answers to questions you might have.\n\nShould you upgrade to the 13-inch iPad Pro with M4 chip if you already own the M2 12.9-inch iPad Pro? And what about the 11-inch model? Find out in this head-to-head comparison that pits the M4 iPad Pro against the M2 iPad Pro.\n\nThe M4 iPad Pro stands as Apple's biggest upgrade ever to the iPad Pro lineup, and it shows. These tablets boast an even slimmer and lighter design while packing more features than ever before. They are also the first devices in Apple's lineup to feature the company's next-gen M4 system-on-a-chip, which arrives just seven months after the M3's debut.\n\nHowever, if you already own an M2 iPad Pro, you might want to hold out instead of upgrading to the new model right away. Read on for more on how the M4 iPad Pros stack up to the M2 iPad Pros.\n\nThe M2 iPad Pros were very slim and light, considering all the tech they packed. But with the M4 models, Apple took its slender game to another level. The new tablets are the slimmest Apple products ever, with the 11-inch iPad Pro measuring just 5.3mm thin. The 13-inch model is even thinner at 5.1 mm.\n\nBoth 2024 models are notably lighter than their predecessors, with the bigger 13-inch iPad Pro being almost 25% lighter than the M2 version. And to avoid any bending problems, Apple used a new internal structure on the M4 iPad Pros for better rigidity. The thermal dissipation is also better, with a metal cover helping spread heat more effectively.\n\nAnother small but important change is that the 12MP front camera is now placed in the landscape bezel for better video calls.\n\nThere was a glaring gap between the 12.9-inch iPad Pro and the 11-inch iPad Pro with the M2 chip. The former used a superior Mini-LED panel, while the latter featured a regular LED panel. Due to this, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro was capable of hitting a peak brightness of 1,600 nits while viewing HDR content.\n\nThis is not the case with the M4 iPad Pros. Apple switched to Tandem OLED technology, which it says produces the \"world's most advanced display.\" Featuring two OLED panels, the new iPad Pros deliver 1,000 nits of SDR brightness, 40% brighter than the M2 models. They also provide better colors, contrast and details than previous iPads, making them ideal for professional use.\n\nWhen it comes to stylus support, the M4 iPad Pros work with the new Apple Pencil Pro as well as the budget-priced USB-C Apple Pencil. The M2 iPad Pro does not work with Apple Pencil Pro, but does work with the USB-C Apple Pencil as well as the second-generation Apple Pencil.\n\nIn a first for iPads, you can order the M4 iPad Pros with an optional nano-texture glass coating. The coating helps reduce unwanted glare but can be difficult to maintain.\n\nThe M2 iPad Pros were ridiculously fast given their form factor and slim package. But with the 2024 iPad Pros, Apple upped the ante on performance. They ship with the Cupertino company's latest and greatest M4 SoC, fabricated on TSMC's second-gen 3nm node.\n\nPacking 28 billion transistors, the M4 chip features a 10-core CPU with four performance cores and six efficiency cores. These next-gen CPU cores also benefit from improved branch prediction and wider decode and execution engines. Combined with other changes, Apple says the M4's CPU is 1.5x faster than the M2. (Note: Only 2024 iPad Pro models with 1TB or higher storage ship with the 10-c0re CPU and 16GB RAM. Lower storage tiers come with a nine-core CPU and pack 8GB RAM.)\n\nThe 2022 iPad Pro's M2 SoC is no slouch, either. Yes, it is not the fastest chip around anymore, but you will not find apps and games that can slow it down.\n\nOn the graphics front, the M4's 10-core GPU brings even bigger performance improvements. It supports hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading, boosting rendering performance by 4x and improving graphical quality.\n\nIf you use your iPad Pro for video editing, the M4's dedicated 8K video encode/decode engine with ProRes and ProRAW support will significantly speed up your workflow. There's also a dedicated AV1 decoder for more efficient video streaming.\n\nThe 16-core Neural Engine is significantly faster than the one in the M2, too. Using its AI prowess, you can isolate subjects from the background in a 4K video in Final Cut Pro.\n\nDespite packing so much power, Apple says the M4 iPad Pro can deliver M2-level performance at 50% less power consumption. On the storage front, the M4 iPad Pros start at 256GB -- twice that of the M2 models.\n\nApple's 2024 iPad Pro lineup packs almost the same connectivity options as the 2022 lineup. Surprisingly, though, there is one major downgrade. While the M2 iPad Pro supports mmWave 5G connectivity, this option is missing on the M4 models. So, you won't get those blazing-fast gigabit-plus 5G cellular speeds on your new iPad. Additionally, the new iPads support 31 LTE bands, one less than their predecessor.\n\nAnother notable change is that the M4 iPad Pros only support eSIM because they lack a physical SIM card slot. That's not the case with the M2 models, which support both eSIM and a physical SIM.\n\nIf you use your iPad for taking photos or recording videos, you might not like the M4 iPad Pro as much as the previous model. Unlike the M2-powered tablets, the 2024 iPad Pros ship with only a single rear 12MP camera. Apple ditched the 10MP Ultra Wide camera on them for some reason.\n\nThe front 12MP TrueDepth camera system remains unchanged, though it has been relocated to landscape orientation. This will provide a better experience during online classes or meetings on the new iPad Pros.\n\nApple says the M4 iPad Pros deliver the same battery life as their M2 predecessors. Considering the 2024 tablets sport a more powerful chip and brighter OLED panel in a slimmer body, this is no small feat. Note, however, that you might get less runtime in real-world use if you push the new iPad Pros heavily. But in most cases, they should last as long -- if not longer -- than their 2022 counterparts.\n\nAll the improvements the M4 iPad Pros bring to the table come with a steep bump in price as well. They cost $200 more than their predecessor, a significant price bump. On the 2024 11-inch iPad Pro, the extra $200 gets you a notably better display and a powerful SoC inside an even slimmer and lighter chassis.\n\nThe 13-inch iPad Pro's price hike is more difficult to justify. It gets the same improvements as its smaller sibling. But its predecessor used a mini-LED display, which was already superior to the 11-inch model's LCD panel.\n\nUnless your workflow will greatly benefit from the M4 iPad Pro's Tandem OLED display or M4 chip, there's no reason to ditch your M2 iPad Pro yet. Apple's flagship tablet from 2022 is still more than powerful enough to run all your favorite iPadOS apps and games. In fact, the same chip also powers Apple's 2024 iPad Air lineup.\n\nThe iPad Pro's limiting factor is its software, not its hardware. iPadOS 17 cannot allow you to take full advantage of the M4 iPad Pro's advanced hardware. However, this might change when iPadOS 18 drops later this year with several AI-focused features.", "source": {"uri": "cultofmac.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cult of Mac"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rajesh_pandey@cultofmac.com", "name": "Rajesh Pandey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Display device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High dynamic range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ray tracing (graphics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_acceleration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hardware acceleration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylus_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stylus (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TSMC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_device_fabrication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor device fabrication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transistor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software-defined radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Acorn", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Acorn", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.cultofmac.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/m4-ipad-pro-vs-m2-ipad-pro-comparison.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9589826", "eventUri": "eng-9589826", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Now, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners discovered that compared to iPhone users, iPad customers just hang on to their old devices, which might be a problem for Apple's iPad business.\n\nThat said, while a minority of users are looking for reasons to upgrade to the M4 iPad Pro, some are just hanging on second-hand iPad models.\n\nIn the 12 months ending March 2024, 67% of repeat iPad buyers kept an old one, either by giving it to a family member or friend or simply retaining it. For comparison, only 41% of iPhone buyers kept or handed down their old iPhones.\n\nWhile iPhone users are eager to upgrade their devices more often, it's interesting that they usually opt to trade in for a new model. In contrast, iPad users just keep them (36%), give their tablets to a family member or friend (31%), or buy a new model because they lost, broke, or had the device stolen (23%).\n\nCIRP says the data suggests \"old iPads are quite usable and useful, so retiring them, even in favor of a new model with enhanced features, may not feel urgent.\"\n\nThe research notes that the secondary market for refurbished iPads is less robust than for iPhones or that customers find more value in keeping an old iPad than monetizing it.\n\nI would love to say otherwise, but I feel represented by those CIRP reports. It's been a while since I last upgraded to a new iPad. While thinking about getting the M4 iPad Pro, I found myself surrounded by older models I was either offering for family members or ultimately just keeping for no reason. Why is it so hard to let go of old iPads? And why does Apple offer such low trade-ins for them?", "source": {"uri": "bgr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BGR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jose_adorno@bgr.com", "name": "Jos\u00e9 Adorno", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Lifestyle", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Lifestyle", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ipad-pro-m4-wallpaper-bgr.jpg?resize=1200%2C628", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9589826", "eventUri": "eng-9589826", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

It's an impressive piece of hardware, with a new OLED display, a next-generation M4 processor, revised cameras, and a fresh selection of accessories. For creators who need the power to render music or video, the iPad Pro easily handles heavy-duty apps like Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Photoshop, and more. The latest iPad Air is all most everyday users need in a tablet, but the iPad Pro's potent performance earns it our Editors' Choice award for professionals who demand the most.\n\nApple has updated half of its iPad lineup with new iPad Pro and iPad Air tablets, both of which are available in 11- and 13-inch versions. The biggest differences between them are the displays and the processors. Apple left the iPad mini ($499) and standard iPad ($349) untouched for now.\n\nThe iPad Pro starts at $999 for the 11-inch model and $1,299 for the 13-inch one. Unlike with previous generations, the two Pro tablets share every spec apart from battery size, screen size, and overall dimensions. The 11-inch model measures 9.83 by 6.99 by 0.21 inches (HWD) and weighs 0.98 pounds. The 13-inch model is bigger at 11.09 by 8.48 by 0.20 inches and 1.28 pounds. For comparison, the 13-inch iPad Air (11.04 by 8.46 by 0.24 inches, 1.36 pounds) is nearly identical to the 12.9-inch 2022 iPad Pro (11.04 by 8.46 by 0.25 inches, 1.50 pounds). I tested the 13-inch version.\n\nNon-Apple tablets with similar screen sizes are comparable in size and weight. The 12.9-inch Microsoft Surface Pro 9 (starting at $999) comes in at 11.30 by 8.20 by 0.37 inches and 1.95 pounds, while the 12.4-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ (starting at $999) measures 11.23 by 7.30 by 0.22 inches and weighs 1.28 pounds.\n\nMany people believe thinner and lighter things are better. In this case, they're right. The thinner and lighter iPad Pro indeed feels better to use day in and day out. After a week of testing, the iPad Pro's 0.22-pound reduction in weight (compared with the 2022 model) proved the biggest change in everyday use. It doesn't seem like a lot, but I found the 13-inch model significantly more comfortable to use when sitting on the couch.\n\nIn terms of size, the 11-inch model fits well in small bags and some purses, while the 13-inch model requires something more like a backpack or messenger bag for transport.\n\nThe iPad Pro sports an aluminum chassis that forms the flat rear panel and side edges, while an all-glass front nestles into the frame. Apple doesn't specify what type of glass it uses. It's an elegant design and manufactured with the highest degree of precision. Apple also doesn't make any claims about the durability of the tablet. For reference, the Galaxy Tab S9 carries an IP68 rating for protection against dust and water.\n\nPlenty of functional elements line the sides. If you hold the tablet in a landscape orientation, the power button rests at the top of the left side and the volume buttons are nearby on the top edge. All three buttons have excellent travel and feedback. The short sides also host an array of four speakers that produce stereo sound. It's a pleasure to use the iPad Pro to listen to music or watch movies. The single USB-C (Thunderbolt 3 and USB4) port is on the right edge. Four microphones are scattered about, as well. Apple ditches the physical SIM card tray in favor of eSIM. Three copper pogo pins on the rear provide power and connectivity for accessories.\n\nThe rear camera module is in the same spot, but the user-facing camera is now on the top long edge (huzzah!) for an improved video chatting experience. The standard iPad made this change back in 2022, so it was long overdue on the Pro models.\n\nApple sells the iPad Pro in Silver or Space Black. I received the latter for testing. It's a darker black than the previous-generation iPad, though I still wish it came in a true deep black. If you prefer brighter colors, opt for the cheaper iPad Air.\n\nApple has relied on LCD technology for iPad displays dating back to the original 2010 tablet. Sure, the 2022 iPad Pro adopted mini-LED, but that's still a variant of LCD. For 2024, Apple updates both the 11- and 13-inch iPad Pros with OLED technology -- and the difference is night and day.\n\nThe smaller iPad Pro carries over the screen size from its predecessor but boosts the resolution slightly from 2,388 by 1,668 pixels to 2,420 by 1,668 pixels for the same effective pixel density of 264 pixels per inch (ppi). The larger Pro screen increases in size from 12.9 inches to 13 inches, and from 2,732 by 2,048 pixels to 2,752 by 2,064 pixels (also at 264ppi). Both screens retain an adaptive refresh rate that dynamically changes from 10Hz to 120Hz to balance power needs and performance (Apple calls this ProMotion). Apple boosts the maximum brightness of SDR content from 600 nits to 1,000 nits but keeps the maximum brightness of XDR content at 1,600 nits. However, in keeping with one of the major benefits of OLED technology, contrast doubles from 1,000,000:1 to 2,000,000:1. (Samsung's Galaxy Tab S tablets have relied on OLED for years, so Apple's playing a bit of catch-up here.)\n\nTo construct these screens, Apple pairs two OLED panels (tandem OLED). This makes for an OLED display that's twice as bright as a single panel. OLED screens are better at displaying black levels than LCDs, so they look more dynamic overall. Nowhere is the difference more obvious than when you watch HDR content on Apple TV+ or Netflix, edit ProRes footage, or tweak HDR photos. The improved color depth is simply outstanding. Apple says the new screens include P3 color and True Tone for auto-adjusting white balance.\n\nOther standard features apply, including a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating, an antireflective coating, and a fully laminated coating. If you care to spend an extra $100, you can upgrade to the nano-texture glass on the 1TB and 2TB models. This micro-etched glass scatters light to create a near-matte appearance with almost no reflections. I didn't test a nano-texture model but did view one in person. The reflection-muting power is impressive, though the overall experience has a little less wow factor than the standard display, which is more dazzling. If you often work outdoors or in bright spaces, the nano-texture might be worth the upgrade.\n\nFor comparison, the iPad Air tablets have screens with 2,360 by 1,640 pixels (11-inch) and 2,732 by 2,048 pixels (13-inch), both at 264ppi. They feature most of the same coatings as the Pro models but use LED-backlit IPS LCD panels that max out at 500 and 600 nits for the 11- and 13-inch models, respectively.\n\nApple gives the revamped iPad Pros an entirely new processor. Whereas the 2022 model shipped with Apple's M2 chip, the 2024 tablets skip over the 2023-era M3 in favor of the redesigned M4. There are two slightly different variants of the M4.\n\niPad Pro models with 256GB or 512GB of storage get an M4 with 9 CPU cores (3 performance, 6 efficiency), 10 GPU cores, 16 NPU cores (neural engine), 120GB/s of memory bandwidth, and 8GB of RAM. iPad Pros with 1TB or 2TB of storage gain a 10-core CPU (4 performance, 6 efficiency) and more RAM at 16GB. Other processor specs remain the same.\n\nApple doubles the base storage in the Pro models from 128GB to 256GB. The other options (512GB, 1TB, and 2TB) remain the same at additional cost. I tested a 1TB model with a 10-core CPU and 16GB of RAM.\n\nThe M4 is a powerful processor that easily surpasses the M3 and older Apple chips, as well as many other SoCs on the market. In terms of everyday use, the iPad Pro simply flies. It performs everything in a blink, including OS updates, app updates, media downloads, and much more. Simple apps like Safari, Gmail, and Slack are no chore at all for the iPad. Multitasking with Stage Manager poses no threat to performance either.\n\nI tested a prerelease version of Apple Logic Pro 2 and found the M4 was more than capable of handling complex music tracks with multiple instruments and voices. When I tried RAM-intensive apps like Lightroom and Photoshop, it managed on-device and cloud-based photo libraries with ease.\n\nBeyond my anecdotal experiences, I ran a number of benchmarks to quantify the performance. The iPad Pro achieved scores of 3,679 and 14,647 on the single- and multi-core tests for Geekbench 6; 8,597 total frames at 51.5fps for 3DMark; 3,858 total frames at 60fps for GFXBench Aztec Ruins High Tier; and 2,746,950 for AnTuTu.\n\nThose figures compare well with the M2 iPad Pro, which scored 2,502 and 9,496 on Geekbench 6; 6,914 on 3DMark, and 2,197,677 on Antutu. For further comparison, the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra scored 2,069 and 5,408 on the single- and multi-core tests in Geekbench 6.\n\nIt's worth pointing out here that the latest iPad Air relies on the same M2 chip as the old iPad Pro and performs well in its own right. It tops out at 8GB of RAM and comes with either 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of storage.\n\nThe story of the iPad's battery life is one of a broken record. Since the original iPad debuted in 2010, Apple has marketed 10 hours of battery life for surfing the web over Wi-Fi. That remains unchanged. You get a bit less (9 hours) if you surf over 5G or a bit more if you watch locally stored videos.\n\nOn PCMag's standard battery test, in which we stream 1080p video over Wi-Fi with the screen at full brightness, the Pro hit 7 hours and 43 minutes. That's a significant improvement over the 2022 model's 6 hours and 31 minutes, but still not quite 10 hours. For comparison, the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra lasts far longer at 9 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nThe iPad Pro supports 20W wired charging and takes close to two hours to fully recharge. Apple includes a charger and USB-C-to-USB-C cable in the box. It doesn't support wireless charging or reverse charging.\n\nIt's somewhat shocking that the iPad's battery life has not benefited at all from Apple's advancements in processor efficiency over the last 14 years. Apple's MacBooks, for example, can run for more than 20 hours. There's no reason the iPad Pro (particularly the larger 13-inch model) can't push through 12 or more hours per charge. That said, out in the real world, I had a hard time running the iPad Pro's battery down in a day.\n\nThe iPad Pro comes with most of the right radios. The 5G version costs $200 more than the Wi-Fi model, a significant premium that doesn't include the required monthly data fees.\n\nFor an unknown reason, Apple dropped support for mmWave 5G, though the iPad Pro retains most sub-6GHz 5G bands, including C-band. This change means the Pro iPads can no longer reach the fastest peak download speeds over cellular networks (around 2Gbps) but can still deliver fast enough service for most users (up to about 600Mbps). Of course, it's backward compatible with LTE 4G.\n\nIn real-world tests on Verizon's 5G network in the New York City area, I saw good speeds. In an area with Verizon Ultra Wideband coverage, download and upload speeds respectively reached 391Mbps and 129Mbps. For reference, the 2022 iPad Pro hit comparable speeds of 354Mbps and 133Mbps under the same circumstances.\n\nThe iPad carries over the same Wi-Fi 6E radio from the previous generation. I was hoping for an upgrade to Wi-Fi 7, but it appears as though Apple is holding off on the latest Wi-Fi for the moment. When I tested over a 1Gbps home internet connection, the iPad Pro reached top speeds of 569Mbps down and 140Mbps up near the router and 222Mbps down and 97Mbps up at the network's edge. That compares well with the M2 iPad Pro, which posted 535Mbps down and 143Mbps up, and 207Mbps down and 93Mbps up, respectively, in the same spots.\n\nApple doesn't update the Bluetooth radio. The new iPad Pro runs version 5.3, the same as the M2 iPad (the latest version is 5.4). It works well with a range of wireless earphones and headphones, including AirPods.\n\nWith support for Thunderbolt 3 and USB4, the USB-C port is as powerful as ever. For example, it can handle incredible data transfer speeds of up to 40Gbps. Thunderbolt support also means the iPad Pro is compatible with plenty of third-party accessories. Moreover, the iPad Pro can drive external displays at resolutions of up to 6K as well as support read/write to external storage. This latter function means Pro users can work on files stored on hard drives rather than the internal storage.\n\nThe latest iPad Air models have the same wireless connectivity suite and I expect to see similar performance, though their USB-C ports are limited to USB3 and speeds of 10Gbps.\n\nTablets, in general, make for terrible cameras. The iPad Pro is an exception to that generality, despite the sheer awkward nature of its size for the task.\n\nCritically, Apple moves the TrueDepth/FaceID camera from the short edge to the long edge. This is vital for frequent FaceTimers, Zoomers, and Google Meeters. It means you appear centered in your video chats rather than low and off to the side. It's a change long-sought by iPad users and a welcome update to the Pro. It also improves the experience of authenticating your face to unlock the iPad or make purchases. FaceID is the iPad Pro's lone biometric security tool. The iPad Air still relies on a fingerprint reader built into the power button.\n\nThe 12MP camera itself is quite good. Its f/2.4 aperture could be a bit brighter, but the camera does a great job with depth control and bokeh effects. You get a nice suite of video features as well, including 1080p HD capture with extended dynamic range, cinematic stabilization, wide color, and lens correction. My coworkers didn't notice when I switched from my normal Logitech HD webcam to the iPad Pro for our morning meeting, which is all the validation I need about the camera's quality.\n\nThe Pro drops the ultra-wide camera from earlier models in favor of a single 12MP rear camera. It has an aperture of f/1.8, digital zoom to 5x, an adaptive True Tone flash, a revised autofocus module, and support for Smart HDR 4. It captures wide color and Apple's Live Photos, and includes stabilization.\n\nAs far as tablet cameras go, it's a winner. You won't find one that takes sharper, richer photos. While some people may bemoan the loss of the ultra-wide lens, the standard camera is more than capable for your tablet photography needs.\n\nThis is doubly true when it comes to video. Few tablets can capture 4K60 video or ProRes at 4K30. The Pro also includes features like audio zoom, slow-motion capture in 1080p, time-lapse, and well as stabilized capture at 720p, 1080p, and 4K. It's simply a top-tier device for video capture.\n\nThe iPad Pro ships with iPadOS 17.5. Apple hasn't introduced too many new software features for the iPad, at least not yet. It certainly hasn't shown off any type of AI for the tablet. I expect to see a full list of new capabilities once Apple debuts iPadOS 18, which won't reach the new hardware until fall 2024. While you wait, you can be comfortable knowing that you have years of OS and security updates on deck to keep the M4 iPad Pro in step.\n\nApps aren't a problem. iPadOS has more customized apps for its screen size and power than any other tablet platform. You can find everything you need in the App Store, including hardcore productivity tools, advanced games, and more.\n\nThe problem is moving things between apps. Though a basic file manager is on board, finding the file you need and opening it in the app you want is often more challenging than it should be. The built-in share sheets work fine, but invariably something is missing or incompatible. Further, while Stage Manager helps you manage multitasking between a handful of apps at a time, it's still not the best window-management tool available. I'm not asking Apple to make the iPad a Mac, but to at least give us a simple desktop environment for controlling app windows and files.\n\nSamsung tablets have had a feature like this, called DeX, for years. It's not perfect, but it can be a boon to productivity in some cases.\n\nNew iPads mean new accessories, and Apple updates the two most important iPad tools: the Apple Pencil and the Magic Keyboard.\n\nThe $129 Apple Pencil Pro works with both the iPad Pro and iPad Air, but not older iPads. It gains a handful of new tools for artists to put to creative use. For example, Apple adds a pressure-sensitive area just above the tip. Squeeze it to bring up the Pencil's toolbar, which includes alternate brushes, an eraser, and more. A built-in gyroscope makes the Pencil more sensitive to movement, like a rolling motion. By rolling the Pencil between your fingertips, you can alter the angle of the tip to ensure it's facing the right way for certain fonts. The Pencil also includes a haptic engine that vibrates to provide feedback and adds support for Apple's Find My network, which can help you find it if you lose it. I plan to fully review the Apple Pencil Pro soon.\n\nThe Magic Keyboard ($299 for the 11-inch, $349 for the 13-inch) is new for the iPad Pro, but the Folio Keyboard has gone away. The keyboard is thinner and lighter than the previous version (believe it or not, this makes a huge difference), includes a row of function keys, adds aluminum to the palm rests, and enlarges the trackpad. After using it for a week, I can safely say it's a better keyboard all around.\n\nBeyond Apple's first-party offerings, the iPad benefits from a universe of compatible third-party accessories.\n\nThe M4-powered Apple iPad Pro is likely overkill for most people given its tremendous power and high starting cost. But we can't deny that it has one of the best screens of any tablet, a thin, light, and attractive design, speedy wired and wireless connectivity, top-flight cameras, satisfactory battery life, and outstanding first-party accessories. Overall, it's our Editors' Choice winner for creatives who want a slim, light tablet that can handle practically anything. Just keep in mind that the iPad Air is more than sufficient if you stick to GarageBand, iMovie, and other lightweight creative apps.", "source": {"uri": "au.pcmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PCMag Australia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S9", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy S9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Tab_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy Tab series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pixel density"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pixel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "High dynamic range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Logic Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geekbench", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Geekbench"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logitech", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logitech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop_Customization", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop Customization", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_au/review/a/apple-ipad/apple-ipad-pro-2024_ndhm.1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9589826", "eventUri": "eng-9589826", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Safeguarding your tablet gives you peace of mind. And, with a range of great-looking cases to choose from, you can upgrade aesthetics, too.\n\nSmart Folio for iPad Air 13-Inch (M2) Best iPad Air 13-Inch Case Overall $99 at Amazon GILLKEN Folio Protective Case Best Budget iPad Air 13-Inch Case $30 at Amazon OtterBox Statement Series Studio Case Best iPad Air 13-Inch Case With Apple Pencil Holder See at Apple Logitech Combo Touch Case For iPad Air Best 13-inch iPad Air Keyboard Case See at Apple ESR Rebound Hybrid Case 360 Best Rugged iPad Air 13-Inch Case $37 at Amazon See More ESR for iPad Air 13-inch Case Best Clear iPad Air 13-Inch Case $20 at Amazon May Chen for iPad Case Best 13-inch iPad Air Case for Kids $28 at Amazon Key Considerations When Choosing an 13-Inch iPad Air Case\n\nThe 6th generation of the iPad Air is the first of the series to include a 13-inch model. This size increase will please tablet users who have a preference for a larger screen. However, for new buyers, this might mean a new protective case is also on the cards.\n\nThere are some quality protective cases specifically designed for this new tablet that offer precise cutouts and moldings. These tend to be a little pricier. But, some older iPad Pro 12.9-inch cases (5th- and 6th-gen models) will likely still fit the 13-inch iPad Air just as well, as the only difference in dimensions is that the iPad Air is 0.01 inches thinner.\n\nAnother thing new iPad Air 13-inch owners should be aware of is that the tablet does not support the Apple Pencil (2nd Generation) or earlier. It supports the new Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Pencil (USB-C) only. This may cause frustration among new iPad Air owners. Nevertheless, the Apple Pencil Pro does have significant upgrades, especially for creative types, so it may be worth trading in that 2nd-gen stylus and investing in this newest iteration.\n\nHaving a dedicated slot to store and charge your Apple Pencil Pro is a handy feature to look out for. If the slot offers a secure fit, it gives peace of mind to those who worry about losing an expensive accessory. It also means you don't need to remove the case to charge it.\n\nBut, when searching for a protective case for your 13-inch iPad Air, you may notice that some sellers state their case to be compatible with the Apple Pencil (2nd Generation). However, this does not mean you cannot charge your Apple Pencil Pro using these cases because the two Apple Pencils are precisely the same size. It will slot into the space just as snugly as previous generations and charge as normal.\n\nYou'll also want to check the case for durability.

However, the iPad Air can be a great choice for older kids and teenagers. It's a good pick for educational purposes, creative projects, and, of course, entertainment. And those older kids and teenagers will love the wide choice of colorful and trendy designs the May Chen Case provides. From Cute Lion and Cute Owl to Space Galaxy, there's a design for even the fussiest teenagers among the 37 choices.\n\nThe case is covered front and back with scratch-resistant polyurethane leather. It's tough and easy to wipe clean. The grip is also good, but it has a luxurious, soft feel, and the beautiful designs are the frosting on the cake. Under the PU leather is impact-resistant TPU plastic. This plastic also covers and fortifies the corners, protecting your iPad Air.\n\nYou can set the case in two positions. The 65-degree angle is ideal for watching movies or video chatting, or you can lay it down at a 30-degree angle for sketching, drawing, and note-taking. There's also a slot to hold and charge the Apple Pencil Pro. It clasps the stylus in place and features a small notch that allows you to easily poke the Pencil back out.\n\nMay Chen for iPad Case Best 13-inch iPad Air Case for Kids\n\nThis iPad Case is great for older kids, with a variety of styles, good protection, and an Apple Pencil holder.\n\n$28 at Amazon\n\nFAQ Can I use my old iPad Air case with the new Air model?\n\nIf you have bought a 13-inch iPad Air, then no, you can't. This model is the first 13-inch iPad Air. The largest size of previous generations is just 10.9 inches. However, if you have bought a new 6th-generation 11-inch iPad Air, it will fit any old case you have for 4th- and 5th-generation 11-inch models because the dimensions are exactly the same.\n\nWhat is the difference between the 11-inch iPad Air and the 13-inch iPad Air?\n\nThe only difference between the two is the size. The 11-inch model offers better portability, while the 13-inch model provides more room for viewing.\n\nWhat is the difference between the 13-inch iPad Air and the 13-inch iPad Pro?\n\nThe most significant difference is the iPad Pro's M4 chip. This chip hasn't even made it to the MacBook yet, so it is a major feature. However, this also means the 13-inch iPad Pro is considerably more expensive. But, on top of the extra power, the Pro also offers an Ultra Retina XDR display for a more immersive visual experience and ProMotion Technology. The latter is Apple's way of saying the display has a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and gameplay.\n\nThere are other differences favoring the 13-inch iPad Pro, including better audio and a slightly better camera.\n\nDo I need the Apple Pencil Pro for my iPad Air?\n\nThe newest iPad Air only supports Apple Pencil Pro or Apple Pencil (USB-C). This means if you have an older Apple Pencil, it will not work on the iPad Air 13-inch.\n\nHow do I pair my Apple AirPods with my iPad Air?\n\nPairing your AirPods with your iPad Air is simple. On the iPad Air, go to Settings, then Bluetooth and toggle Bluetooth to the on position. Then go back to the Home Screen. Following this, open the case with your AirPods inside and hold it next to your iPad Air (If you have AirPods Max, take them out of the Smart Case). Then, simply follow the onscreen instructions and tap Done.", "source": {"uri": "howtogeek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The How-To Geek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OtterBox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OtterBox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logitech", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Logitech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_kernel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid kernel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyurethane", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Polyurethane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aesthetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfiber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microfiber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stylus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accessibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air_Quality", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air Quality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Paintball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Paintball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Airguns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Airguns", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/logitech-combo-touch-for-ipad-air-11.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9589826", "eventUri": "eng-9589826", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nSure, the 2024 versions of the iPad Pro and iPad Air are powerful on their own, but when combined with certain accessories, these tablets can do something they've never been able to do before: replace your laptop, leaving you with just one lightweight powerhouse that pretty much does it all.\n\nThe just-released, 2024 Apple iPad Pro and iPad Air tablets are finally here -- each offering a stunning 11-inch or 13-inch touchscreen display. And each version comes in a variety of configurations. But if you consider yourself a power user, the new 13-inch iPad Pro tablets are downright incredible, as you'll discover by reading our in-depth review. We've also done a comprehensive comparison between Apple's 13-inch iPad Pro and Samsung's top-of-the-line Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra tablet.\n\nFor the first time, the iPad Pro can legitimately replace a laptop, with souped-up capabilities that take full advantage of Apple's M4 processor and an absolutely stunning tandem OLED Ultra Retina display.\n\nOur in-house tech experts have curated this roundup of must-have accessories for the latest Apple iPad tablets.\n\nAt the same time Apple released the 2024 iPad Pro, it also debuted a redesigned Apple Magic Keyboard.\n\nUsing the new Magic Keyboard, typing and data entry on the iPad is faster and more accurate, making the tablet work much more like a laptop. The new design features a larger trackpad (now with haptic feedback), a USB Type-C port and a convenient floating cantilever design that adjusts to multiple viewing angles. Also added to the keyboard is a row of 14 function keys that, among other things, make it easier to control the tablet's brightness and volume.\n\nEqually important, when you're not using your iPad, the Magic Keyboard folds over the display to provide front and back protection, with a thin and lightweight design. We love that the new keyboard design also features an aluminum frame and palm rest.\n\nMeanwhile, for the 2024 iPad Air models, Apple still offers the older Magic Keyboard design, which makes the perfect companion to those tablets. Both versions of the keyboard come in your choice of white or black. They attach to the iPad using magnets and conveniently draw power from the tablet.\n\nThe new, redesigned Apple Pencil Pro for the 2024 iPads is a pencil-shaped stylus that allows you to handwrite, draw, or annotate files directly on your screen. It's great for note taking, sketching, marking up documents, editing photos and more.\n\nCompared with the previous Apple Pencils, this new Pro model offers enhanced precision and lower latency for faster response. It's also now tilt- and pressure-sensitive and provides palm rejection support. You also get new features and gestures that work with the Apple Pencil Pro, like hover, double-tap, barrel roll and squeeze -- each of which gives you more control over whatever you're working on.\n\nThe Apple Pencil uses a magnet to attach to the iPad for quick charging and convenient storage. And if you lose it, you can locate the stylus using Apple's Find My feature. Using the Apple Pencil Pro with an app like Notability, Goodnotes 6, Evernote or Apple Notes transforms your tablet into a powerful digital notebook that's terrific for handwritten notes and drawings. Some apps even transform that writing into editable text.\n\nIf you have a new iPad, you should protect it. The Apple Smart Folio Cover is thin, durable and stylish. It provides front and back protection for your tablet and comes in several colors.\n\nWhen you're using the tablet, the Folio Cover folds back and works as a stand. There's a position that's perfect for watching videos or making video calls, and another that's ideal for typing, web surfing and more.\n\nAnytime you put the cover over the touchscreen, the tablet goes into sleep mode. As soon as you fold it back, the tablet wakes up.\n\nThe Apple Smart Folio Cover attaches to the iPad using magnets. Since each of the new 2024 iPad models has a slightly different shape, be sure you choose the right version.\n\nEven if you've invested in the Magic Keyboard, which also can serve as a cover, there will be times when you'll benefit from the more compact design of the Folio Cover.\n\nAll of the 2024 iPads offer enhanced sound -- through either their speakers or wireless earbuds or headphones. As you'd expect, the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) are the perfect companions to all of the new iPad models.\n\nYou get features like spacial audio with dynamic head tracking, superior active noise cancellation, a transparency mode, a conversation-awareness feature and onboard touch controls. These AirPods use Apple's next generation H2 headphone chip. The dust, sweat and waterproof rating of the AirPods Pro has been upped to IP54, which makes them a bit more durable for the gym.\n\nThe active noice cancellation feature does a really good job drowning out ambient noise, even when you're not listening to audio. When you are listening to something, the ANC works in conjunction with the spatial audio (with dynamic head tracking) feature to deliver sound that's far more immersive, robust, and lifelike.\n\nIf you're not sure which AirPods model is right for you, check out our comprehensive 2024 AirPods buyer's guide. It also includes everything you need to know about the Apple AirPods Max headphones.\n\nThe new iPads don't support wireless charging, so when it comes time to recharging, you'll need to connect to a power source with a standard USB Type-C cable (which comes with the tablet).\n\nOne problem iPad users often face is not having an electrical outlet handy. This is when the Apple 35W dual USB-C port compact power adapter comes in clutch.\n\nThis small power adapter allows you to charge two devices at once, using two separate USB Type-C cables when only one AC power socket is available. This is a handy accessory for travel.\n\nIf you use your iPad from a desk, you may need help with video calls and other functions. This stand makes that so much easier. Adjust the iPad's angle to watch a video, or use the tablet with an optional Bluetooth wireless keyboard and mouse.\n\nWe like this accessory because it's made from lightweight but durable aluminum. It's also fully adjustable and folds flat for easy transport. This stand will hold your tablet in either landscape or portrait mode. And it comes in four color options.\n\nOn the bottom of the stand are rubber grips that keep it from sliding around. You'll discover that this stand also works perfectly when your iPad is attached to a cover or most cases, like the Apple Smart Folio Cover.\n\nWhen you're on a really long flight or away from a power source for a while, that's when you'll want a portable power bank.\n\nWe recommend this one from Mophie because it has a 27,000mAh battery that can recharge up to four devices at the same time.\n\nThe PowerStation Pro AC has two USB Type-C ports, one USB Type-A port and an AC port built in. It also supports quick charging of devices that support it. The unit itself weighs 2.15 pounds, but its slim design makes it easy to transport. Also built into the power bank is an LED status meter, so you know how much battery power the unit has remaining.\n\nWhether you're traveling for pleasure or business, Tumi luggage is stylish, durable and high-end. If you're looking for this premium level of protection for your new iPad, we suggest the Tumi Alpha Medium laptop cover.\n\nThis versatile case is made from FXT ballistic nylon. It has a padded compartment that's perfect for holding an 11-inch or 13-inch iPad Pro or iPad Air, along with a handful of other accessories and personal items.\n\nThe case has a zip-entry main compartment, a front U-zip pocket, three media pockets, three card pockets and a pen loop. It measures 9.3 by 12.5 by 1.0 inches and weighs just 0.7 pounds. You can carry this case on its own, or easily insert it into a backpack, carry-on or briefcase.\n\nIf this higher-end Tumi case doesn't perfectly meet your needs, you'll discover other iPad case and cover options available from companies like Zagg, Speck, Otterbox, Targus and Casetify.\n\nThe thing that many iPad users don't realize is that the latest iPads will work with any Bluetooth (wireless) keyboard and mouse. And there are a lot of less expensive options than the Apple Magic Keyboard.\n\nWhile Legitech offers several Magic Keyboard alternatives that also serve as an iPad cover, the company's Keys-to-Go wireless keyboard is a handy and portable keyboard that measures 9.53 by 5.39 by 0.24 inches. This makes it extremely portable. It'll also work with an iPhone, Mac or Apple TV.\n\nThe battery lasts up to three months before needing a recharge. And because this is a fully sealed keyboard, it's automatically protected against spills and crumbs. Plus, it wipes clean in seconds. As you'd expect, the Keys-to-Go keyboard makes typing faster, more comfortable and more accurate, compared with the tablet's virtual keyboard.\n\nTo complement the Keys-to-Go keyboard, Logitech also offers Bluetooth mice that will work with the latest iPads.\n\nFor iPad users who use an Apple Pencil, the ESR magnetic screen protector adds a protective film to help prevent accidental scratches and cracks.\n\nMade from polyethylene terephthalate, this screen protector is less than 0.33mm thick. It also provides the screen with a more authentic-feeling, paper-like surface.\n\nThe ESR magnetic screen protector applies easily to the display and can be removed anytime. This magnetic attachment eliminates unwanted air bubbles that could interfere with your view.\n\nThe ESR iPad Pro magnetic screen protectors are available for the 2024 11-inch iPad Pro and 2024 13-inch iPad Pro, so be sure you select the right version.\n\nNot sure which iPad model is right for you?

Half laptop, half tablet, they run a full desktop operating system like Windows 11 in a touch format. Additionally, you can buy a separate keyboard which turns it into a laptop. This concept is similar to the iPad Pro M4 + Magic Keyboard, with only one difference: the iPad Pro has a tablet operating system (iPadOS) and the Microsoft Surface has a desktop operating system (Windows 11).\n\nLater in this article we will talk about this very differentiating fact. But for now, let's start with a comparison that Microsoft did not teach us. And in their presentation they even brought a MacBook M3 to the stage to compare it directly with the Surface Pro. Although shouldn't the fair comparison be with Apple's M4 Chip?\n\nThe Microsoft Surface It has an ARM Chip Snapdragon X Elite from Qualcomm. On the iPad Pro side, it has Apple's latest processor, the M4 Chip. How will these two processors face each other? The Snapdragon X Elite has more CPU and GPU cores, although the Apple M4 chip has higher performance in monocore.\n\nFurthermore, regarding artificial intelligence, the Snapdragon X Elite has more raw power and greater RAM memory capacity. After all, The Surface is closer to a laptop than a tablet. It's heavier, it's cooled by fans... Apple has adjusted everything related to the M4 Chip for the iPad Pro. Something very different will be when we see the M4 on a MacBook Pro. Still, look at the comparison table, because the M4 Chip equals the Snapdragon X Elite in power.\n\nWe know that the OLED screen of the iPad Pro is a real marvel. If we compare its quality and also add the weight and design, the balance tips towards the iPad Pro M4, which offers a better screen and a more compact and lighter format.\n\nThe general performance of the M4 Chip is superior to that of the Snapdragon X Elite except in specific artificial intelligence tasks. However, here we enter into a well-known debate: Does the iPad take advantage of the full power of Apple chips?\n\nThe Surface Pro has a full desktop operating system such as Windows 11. Allows you to connect to multiple screens and use applications without any type of adaptation. However, Apple with iPadOS has a different concept. It is adapting Mac apps to the iPad, as is the case with Final Cut Pro. It does allow you to connect an external screen, but the management of windows, despite the Visual Organizer, is somewhat clumsier.\n\nAs we can see in the comparison above, although the Surface has a touch screen and the keyboard can be removed, It is closer to a laptop than a tablet. It weighs almost a kilo, is practically twice as thick and has a fan to cool the interior.\n\nIn the background, each team stands out for one thing. The experience on the iPad as a tablet is superior to the Surface, especially because of the wonderful apps in the App Store. On the other hand, the Surface is great for using as a laptop and occasionally for touch.\n\nWould it be better for a MacBook Air, for example, to have a touch screen? Will Apple ever include macOS on iPads? Are complicated answers from a business point of view and they may be cleared at the next WWDC 2024.\n\niPadOS is a top ten operating system for an entry-level iPad and even for an iPad Air. However, for a professional audience such as the iPad Pro may encounter limitations like the ones we mentioned above.\n\nMany of us think that Apple has not finished incorporating functions into iPadOS so that whoever wants it can buy a Mac + an iPad. And ultimately, it is a perfect tactic from a business point of view. However, and as our colleague Javier Lacort comments, can you imagine that the iPhone would not have included the music app so as not to stop selling iPods? We all take it for granted, and Apple confirmed it, that macOS will not appear on the iPad. However, with simple improved window management we would have a leap forward.\n\nSo, no, the iPad is not going to have macOS, but it can get a big improvement with iPadOS 18. The wish list is simple: more flexible window management similar to a desktop environment and the arrival of versions of apps identical to those on the Mac. They share the same processor, so doing this would be relatively simple.\n\nThe next quote to see how all this is resolved is the June 10 at WWDC. For my part, I have explained both sides to you: a tablet that is closer to a PC and an iPad that remains faithful to the iPad experience (although, with limitations).

The iPad and iPhone are no different, but the game is also one that can tax even the most capable of systems. That makes it a pretty good benchmark for testing new devices and you can probably see where this is going.\n\nSomeone took a new M4 iPad Pro to put it through its paces using Genshin Impact to see just how capable a gaming machine Apple's best iPad really is. And as you'll see below, it's incredibly capable indeed.\n\nThe testing was carried out by the YouTube channel Dame Tech and saw the Genshin Impact played on an M4 iPad Pro while the frames-per-second figure was monitored using Apple's Metal performance HUD software. Before the test was run, the game's resolution was increased to see how well it would fare.\n\nAs you can see in the video above, it fared pretty well indeed. Over the course of the test, the M4 iPad Pro managed an average of 113.6 FPS which is considerably more than the M2 iPad Pro's 90 FPS.\n\nHow does that compare to Apple's other high-end mobile device, the iPhone 15 Pro Max? The A17 Pro chip scored 59.2 FPS while running the game at a much lower resolution -- 740p rather than the 1668p of the iPad Pro.\n\nThese results should give people plenty to look forward to in terms of Mac gaming, especially when we start to see the higher core counts of the M3 Pro and M3 Max, let alone an M3 Ultra.", "source": {"uri": "imore.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "iMore"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_haslam@imore.com", "name": "Oliver Haslam", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genshin_Impact", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Genshin Impact"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Puzzle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Puzzle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HPhXG9reXHK3m4sNszvNT-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9589826", "eventUri": "eng-9589826", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

It's been years since Apple started using the iPad \"Pro\" moniker and launching tablets that are well too big to be looked at as actual tablets. The old 12.9-inch iPad Pros, the new 13-incher -- these things are as huge, if not bigger than a MacBook. And the hardware inside has the power to match -- most recently, the Apple M4 made its debut in an iPad, not in any type of Mac!\n\nFor all those years, the tech community has always had one question, and one hope -- why can't we run macOS on these things? And people were analyzing the design elements of each and every next macOS build, looking for signs that it's being made with touchscreen in mind -- bigger buttons, sliders, et cetera.\n\nConsidering that an iPad Pro with all its peripherals costs about the same as a MacBook Pro, it had better be able to do the same tasks with the same efficiency, right?\n\nBut iPadOS is still not great at multitasking, the mobile apps for pro work still can't match the flexibility and ease of use of the desktop (or laptop) apps, and trying to manage files with it it still more awkward and cumbersome.\n\nApple stubbornly refuses to give MacBooks a touchscreen, and the iPad -- a Mac-like operating system. Frustrated fans point towards greed, or a \"lack of understanding\" of what the consumers want.\n\nWell, considering that the MacBooks are among the best-selling laptops, and the iPads are the best-selling tablets, I'm not sure we should chuck that one up to Apple not \"getting\" the customers.\n\nWith these two categories being so popular and doing so well, Apple is in a unique position to try and deliver a different class of device -- not a tablet that cannibalizes the laptop space, but a tablet that does its own unique thing.\n\nNow, this is where the hiccup is -- admittedly, Cupertino doesn't seem to know exactly how to turn the iPad into its own thing that's different from a personal computer. Which is why new updates and new features are so excruciatingly slow to arrive. At least that's what I believe.\n\nBack in the day when Slide Over and Split View were introduced, I remember that the iPad was already years late to the multi-tasking party. Most recently, we got windowed-apps multi-tasking on iPads, but instead of making it like a \"normal\" desktop interface, Apple had to invent the Stage Manager spinoff.\n\nAnd that didn't fly over too well -- Stage Manager in iPadOS 16 was limiting, frustrating, and nausea-inducing, since it was so dead-set on using exact window sizes in exact spots on the screen. Now, with iPadOS 17, it's much more lax and generally -- very usable.\n\nBut that whole Stage Manager fiasco, combined with the \"What's a computer?\" ad campaign for iPads of old, got me thinking about how Apple looks at the iPad and why it's never going to get macOS.\n\nSimply put:\n\nOK, I am going to assume that, if you are here, reading this editorial and wondering why the \"iPad Pro is so limited\", you are probably a tech-savvy person. You love to push your phones to the brim, maybe launch a benchmark after each update, and you most probably are quite well-acquainted with working on a desktop interface -- be it macOS or Windows.\n\nWell... the iPad Pro is not exactly for you. The only value you can get out of an iPad is if you specifically use it as a sidekick device, an assistant, a powerful screen for when you are away from your main screen. And there are definitely use cases to be had there, but it won't be the spine of your digital work.\n\nSo, if it's not for you -- why is it packed with cutting-edge hardware, why does Apple market it as being able to create music, splice videos, and work for photo editing?\n\nSimple -- there's a subset of people, professionals in different fields, that don't really know how to use a computer. Over the last 17 years, smartphones have permeated everything -- they have brought the Internet to the hands of the people, they have made businesses dependent on having a digital presence, and they have made creating media, websites, and promotions extremely simple.\n\nI know such people -- young, successful, intelligent. They have a business, and they create TikToks, Reels, photo posts, ads, and other content to keep their services on the mind of their customers -- all from their phones. It's just that their work and lifestyle is more physical, or in the service space -- they haven't spent much time behind a keyboard in their life.\n\nNow, imagine if one such person decides to upgrade from working on a smartphone -- double-thumbing that small screen and squinting to trim the timeline of a clip just right gets old at some point. \"It's time to upgrade to a computer\" that person might think.\n\nLearn Windows? Learn macOS? What a daunting thought for someone who has way too much to do in a day.\n\nOh, but what's an iPad? Well... it's kind of like a computer, but it looks, acts, and works much more like a smartphone. \"I can do that!\"\n\nSo, once that thought dawned on me, it kind of clicked into place -- this is why Apple stubbornly insists on having the iPad feel like a phone, with all the limitations that might entail. No taskbars, no multi-windows (unless with an external monitor), no need to dig into the file system, no need to look for apps outside the App Store.\n\nTo a seasoned PC or Mac user, that sounds like a headache and a half. To someone who's afraid to learn yet another tech gadget, but wants a bigger working space -- it might sound much more familiar and inviting.\n\nLike the photographer that wants to spend more time with their camera and less time on a keyboard -- the idea of being able to edit their photos on what is essentially a \"floating screen\" is quite appealing. Or the artist that wants to draw on something that's not a Wacom tablet paired to a laptop.\n\nNow, the argument that the iPad Pro may be way overpriced for what it offers is still legitimate here. The fact that the Air doesn't have a 120 Hz refresh rate is pretty hard to swallow. The prices of the Magic Keyboard and the Apple Pencil send your iPad investment over the moon. Yes, Apple's pricing strategy is way out there... But, apparently, it works.\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say -- no. But, again, Apple is excruciatingly slow at implementing new stuff. Trying to add new features without stepping on the toes of the MacBook, yet enhancing the UI of the iPad and keeping it in its own \"productive tablet\" category.\n\nI wouldn't dare assume what else is coming -- the way that iPadOS implemented a mouse pointer is silly at first, yet so \"mobile\". The Stage Manager basically surprised all of us -- who sits down to reinvent the floating window multi-tasking, right?", "source": {"uri": "phonearena.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Phone Arena"}, "authors": [{"uri": "preslav_kateliev@phonearena.com", "name": "Preslav Kateliev", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MacOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer multitasking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchscreen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peripheral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS_16", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS 16"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_editing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Image editing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacom_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wacom (company)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://m-cdn.phonearena.com/images/article/158587-wide-two_1200/The-iPad-will-never-get-macOS-this-is-why.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9589826", "eventUri": "eng-9589826", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The Pro range has also received a significant upgrade, with the 2024 models featuring a super slim design, an enhanced OLED screen that's brighter, and a lightning-fast M4 processor, making these tablets faster than most PC laptops, reports the Mirror.\n\nThe Air starts at \u00a3599, while the upgraded Pro begins at \u00a3999. If these prices seem steep, it's worth noting that some of the UK's largest mobile networks are offering contract deals on the latest iPad range.\n\nOne deal that stands out is from Sky, which is offering the 11-inch Air with Wi-Fi for just \u00a317 per month, with no upfront fee and 128MB of data included.

A report by CIRP (Consumer Intelligence Research Partners) reveals this information. This data comes after Apple recently unveiled a new lineup of iPads.\n\nThe question remains: what drives iPad upgrades? A main factor seems to be whether users feel their current device is still usable. This report examines what iPad owners do with their \"old\" iPads when they purchase a new one. For comparison, it also analyzes iPhone user behavior.\n\nThere is a significant difference in upgrade habits. In the twelve months ending March 2024, a substantial 67% of iPad upgraders kept their old iPads. This includes users who either gifted them to family or friends or held onto them for themselves. In contrast, only 41% of iPhone upgraders reported keeping or handing down their previous phones.\n\nThe biggest difference lies in how often iPads are passed on. One-third of pre-owned iPads are used by friends or family members, whereas only 10% of older iPhones find a second life with loved ones. This clearly shows that iPads remain functional and relevant for longer.\n\nThe report also shows a difference in trade-in behavior. Less than 5% of iPad upgraders traded in their old device compared to nearly half of iPhone upgraders.\n\nThere's a difference in why some users upgrade. 23% of iPad upgraders reported needing to replace a lost, stolen, or broken device, compared to only 6% of repeat iPhone buyers.\n\nPersonally, when I try to put myself in the picture, I also follow the same pattern, be it Apple products or Androids. I use my tablet way less than I use my phone. Hence, I believe that my phone should stay updated on the latest changes compared to my tablet.\n\nMore over, it's about functionality to me. I mostly just watch videos and movies on my tablet and sometimes use it as my second screen, hence I don't feel the need to upgrade it, but on the other hand, I do almost everything on my phone.\n\nFinally, here is the breakdown of the chart data\n\nNow that you've read it all, if you're thinking if it is worth upgrading to iPad Pro 7 M4 from iPad Pro 6, here is a comparison guide for you.", "source": {"uri": "macobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mac Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "devesh_beri@macobserver.com", "name": "Devesh Beri", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.macobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/iPhone-with-iPad.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9589826", "eventUri": "eng-9589826", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

The behavior highlights unique aspects of iPad usage and customer loyalty.\n\nMany old iPads find new life with family members or friends. Approximately one-third of old iPads are handed down, compared to about 10% of old iPhones.\n\nThe necessity of replacing old devices also differs between iPad and iPhone users. About 23% of iPad upgraders replaced their device due to loss, theft, or damage, compared to only 6% of iPhone upgraders. The new data from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) suggests that iPads are less frequently replaced out of necessity, further reinforcing their longevity and usefulness.\n\nThe trend suggests that older iPads remain functional and desirable even as new models are released. For many, the need to upgrade to the latest iPad isn't as urgent, allowing the older devices to serve more roles in households.\n\nAnother critical factor is the trade-in and secondary market for iPads versus iPhones. Less than 10% of iPad upgraders trade in their old device, compared to almost half of iPhone upgraders.\n\nThe difference indicates that users value keeping their old iPads more than selling them. Moreover, the retained value and utility of old iPads often outweigh the benefits of trading them in for a small financial return.\n\nApple's iPad remains a versatile and valuable device long after its initial purchase.

Easy Fixes", "body": "Lithium-ion will eventually degrade over time, though typically not so quickly in a new device.\n\nWhile plenty of folks are no doubt salivating over the new 13-inch iPad Pro sporting that blazing M4 Apple silicon chip, some may find themselves displeased at the battery life draining fast. This could be due to various factors (e.g., usage habits or software glitches), but it's worth investigating potential hardware issues as well.\n\nLet's explore some solutions to address this concern. Hopefully, we see some improvement afterward. Getting repairs on a (pricey) device that's almost brand-new seems unfair.\n\nGoing off what many users within the Apple Support community are experiencing, it would seem that many are experiencing battery drain during the night. An important thing to remember is that if your device is new, there are still a load of background processes that your iPad is working on, including indexing. As Apple Support user Branta UK explains, these processes can cause higher battery load, making your battery drain faster. It can take about a day for things to become normal.\n\nYou should also consider the fact that the device is likely new, so you may be playing with it far more than you typically would. I know when I buy a new device, I have a tendency to gawk at the shiny new screen for hours on end. Essentially, give it some time. Remember that your new iPad still needs to sort out Optimized Battery Charging for you. This feature runs automatically on an iPad, and users cannot disable it.\n\nConsidering many within the Support community seem to be having this issue at night, it may be a good idea to put your iPad into Airplane Mode while you sleep. You can easily enable this feature directly from your Control Center. You can also enable it directly from your Settings.\n\nWhile in your Settings or Control Center, it can also be a good idea to shut off anything else that you're not using. This includes features such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Make sure to enable them again in the morning.\n\nApart from turning off wireless communications to help extend battery life, turn on resource-saving features as well. Along with Optimized Battery Charging being baked-in directly, you can also enable Low Power Mode, which reduces certain features on your device. You can enable Low Power Mode via Settings > Battery.\n\nYou may also want to enable Automatic Brightness, which can ensure your screen is using the proper amount of power. This is good for your battery.\n\nIf you're still experiencing battery issues, it may be time to contact Apple Support. While rare, it is possible that your iPad has a faulty battery. But if you're having issues with your iPad battery and the device is nearly brand-new, give it a couple of days before calling for repairs.", "source": {"uri": "macobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mac Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_decourville@macobserver.com", "name": "Nick deCourville", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lithium-ion battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brightness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brightness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wireless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bluetooth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.macobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/iPad-Pro-Draining-Fast-May-2024-Featured.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9589826", "eventUri": "eng-9589826", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

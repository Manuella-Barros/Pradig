You'll know that in opposition you don't get access to the classified briefings, the intelligence that would be required to set out what shape and size our armed forces should be.'\n\nSir Keir is facing pressure from opposition critics and former military chiefs over the timescale of decision-making on funding, with some arguing it cannot wait given the gravity of threats facing Britain.\n\nAdmiral Lord West, a former head of the Navy who was a security minister under a previous Labour government, claimed the new administration was 'delaying spending money' by not setting out a plan, which meant 'there is no money' for the Ministry of Defence.\n\nThe Tories, who said they would increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2030 before losing the election, said the approach was 'damaging for the armed forces'.\n\nStorm Shadow missiles are seen attached to the hard points of a Eurofighter Typhoon\n\nA Panavia Tornado jet is seen deploying a Storm Shadow missile\n\nNATO leaders pose for a family photo before President Joe Biden, front row center, delivers remarks on the 75th anniversary of NATO at the Andrew W.

Ukraine can - and will - stop Putin,' Biden said forcefully to applause.\n\nBut the US president himself is facing a tough election challenge from Donald Trump, who has loudly questioned the utility of NATO and previously said he would be able to 'end the war in 24 hours' if he were in charge.\n\nThe comments sparked fears that Washington would quickly withdraw its military support for Ukraine and seek to force Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to accept a peace deal that would see large swathes of territory ceded to Moscow.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump's Republican allies in the US Congress also forced a delay of months in approving new weapons for Ukraine.\n\nThe notion is not lost on NATO leaders, with outgoing Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg acknowledging the question marks over ongoing US support.\n\n'Ukraine has shown remarkable courage and NATO allies have provided unprecedented support. But let's be honest - not even our support for Ukraine has been a given,' Stoltenberg said.\n\n'Remember - the biggest cost and the greatest risk will be if Russia wins in Ukraine.

Join us in this fight.\n\nNew U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer signaled that Ukraine could use Storm Shadow long-range missiles to hit military targets inside Russia, Bloomberg reported on July 10.\n\nStarmer outlined his position, saying that it is up to Ukraine how to use British missiles. His remarks echoed the words of former U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron, indicating there will be no change of policy on the matter after Starmer's Labour Party won the elections last week.\n\nCameron said in early May that Kyiv had the right to use the weapons provided by London to strike targets on Russian soil. The Kyiv Independent's source in the president's office disputed the statement, saying that there was no green light from the U.K. at that time.\n\nThe missiles are \"obviously to be used in accordance with international humanitarian law\" and \"for defensive purposes,\" but \"it is for Ukraine to decide how to deploy (them) for those defensive purposes,\" the prime minister said during the NATO summit in Washington.\n\nUkraine has reportedly used U.K.-supplied Storm Shadow missiles, with a range of up to 250 kilometers (150 miles), to hit Russian military targets in Crimea, a sovereign Ukrainian territory illegally annexed by Russia.\n\nWhen Russia launched its intensified offensive against Kharkiv Oblast in May, a number of countries said they had lifted restrictions on the use of Western-provided weapons against military targets inside Russia.\n\nThe U.S. granted Kyiv limited permission to use certain American weapons to strike Russian targets near the region's border.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky keeps urging Washington to allow Ukraine to hit targets deep inside Russia, including military aircraft stationed on bases.\n\n\"And we can significantly limit Russian actions in southern Ukraine and push the occupier out of there if American leadership assists us with the necessary deep-strike capabilities against the Russian military and logistics in our Ukrainian Crimea,\" he said on July 10.", "source": {"uri": "kyivindependent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kyiv Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

While some European nations, including the UK, have shown support for Ukraine's position on striking military targets inside Russia, the United States has maintained restrictions on Kyiv's use of its weapons to prevent escalation with Moscow.\n\nStarmer's comments mark the first time he has committed his new administration to this policy following his recent UK general election victory. His stance echoes that of his predecessor, Rishi Sunak, whose government implied Ukraine could use Storm Shadows to strike inside Russia without explicitly stating it.\n\nAddressing the recent Russian strike on a Ukrainian hospital, Starmer described it as an \"absolutely shocking, appalling attack\" that provided \"a very important if tragic backdrop to this summit.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister also delivered a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying, \"This NATO summit should be seen as a clear and united resolve by NATO allies and others that are there at the same time to stand with Ukraine and stand up to Russian aggression.\"\n\nAccording to Jamie Shea, a former NATO official and current associate fellow at Chatham House, Starmer's statement has \"given President Zelenskyy a shot in the arm.\" Shea told Bloomberg that while Ukrainians need the ability to strike significant Russian military targets, NATO leaders would likely draw a red line at strikes against Russian civilian targets.", "source": {"uri": "euromaidanpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euromaidan Press"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maria_tril@euromaidanpress.com", "name": "Maria Tril", "type":

Ukraine support on international debut", "body": "Starmer's unstinting message of continuity on Ukraine comes as questions grow over Kyiv's most vital partner, the United States, where presidential contender Donald Trump has mused about cutting a quick deal with Russia.\n\nDays after his Labour Party swept elections and threw out the Conservatives in power for 14 years, Starmer said he had a \"very good\" meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of NATO's 75th anniversary summit.\n\n\"I made it absolutely clear that as far as the UK is concerned, the change of government makes no difference to the support that we will provide,\" Starmer told reporters.\n\n\"We'd been united on this when we were in opposition, and it was really important to me to be able to affirm that face to face at the meeting,\" said Starmer, who already spoke to Zelensky by telephone after entering Downing Street.\n\nOn his flight to Washington, Starmer said that decisions on the use of British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles were for the Ukrainian armed forces to make.\n\nUK military aid is \"for defensive purposes but it is for Ukraine to decide how to deploy it for those defensive purposes,\" he said.\n\nBritain under three Conservative prime ministers has been among the staunchest supporters of Ukraine in the war, taking the lead in pushing for more advanced military systems and looser restrictions on Kyiv.\n\nUS President Joe Biden, who has strongly backed Ukraine but has been careful not to start a direct conflict with Russia, recently made a similar move by letting Ukraine strike Russian offensive positions just across the border with US weapons.\n\nZelensky hailed the decision on the Storm Shadow missiles, writing on Telegram, \"Thank you for your continued support of Ukraine and our people!\"\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that Russia will take \"appropriate measures\" in response to Starmer's decision.\n\n\"If it is true, it is certainly another absolutely irresponsible step towards fueling tensions and seriously escalating the situation,\" Peskov told reporters.\n\nStarmer will meet later with Biden at the White House, and spoke with other Western leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nStarmer has taken Labour on a more centrist path than his leftist predecessor and, along with his foreign and defense secretaries, all noted in Washington that Britain helped found NATO in 1949 under Labour prime minister Clement Atlee.\n\nStarmer said he hoped the NATO summit would send a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin that the alliance is \"bigger now than it's ever been, more united than it's ever been, and absolutely clear-eyed about the threat of Russian aggression.\"\n\nA NATO summit in Britain in 2014 set a goal of each ally contributing at least two percent of GDP to defense, a long-running demand of the United States.\n\nOnly the United States, Britain and Greece then met the target but since the invasion of Ukraine the number has gone up to 23 members of the 32-nation alliance.\n\nBritain's new defense secretary, John Healey, called for NATO to consider moving toward a 2.5 percent goal.\n\nThe growing threats around the world suggest that \"all NATO nations are going to need to do more than simply two percent,\" Healey told reporters.\n\nHe said, whatever the result of the US election, Washington's priorities are \"increasingly going to shift to the Indo-Pacific.\"\n\n\"European nations in NATO must do more of the heavy lifting,\" Healey said.\n\nsct-iba/del/nro", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

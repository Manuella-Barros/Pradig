He was 61.\n\nBrian Fox, an engineer at Albini's studio, Electrical Audio Recording, said Wednesday that Albini died after a heart attack Tuesday night.\n\nIn addition to his work on canonized rock albums such as Nirvana 's \"In Utero,\" the Pixies\u00b4 breakthrough \"Surfer Rosa,\" and PJ Harvey\u00b4s \"Rid of Me,\" Albini was the frontman of the underground bands Big Black and Shellac.\n\nHe dismissed the term \"producer,\" refused to take royalties from the albums he worked on, and requested he be credited with \"Recorded by Steve Albini,\" a fabled label on albums he worked on.\n\nAt the time of his death, Albini\u00b4s band Shellac were preparing to tour their first new album in a decade, \"To All Trains,\" which releases next week.\n\nOther acts whose music was shaped by Albini include Joanna Newsom\u00b4s indie-folk opus, \"Ys,\" and releases from bands like the Breeders, the Jesus Lizard, Hum, Superchunk, Low and Mogwai.\n\nAlbini was born in California, grew up in Montana, and fell in love with the do-it-yourself punk music scene in Chicago while studying journalism at Northwestern University.\n\nAs a teenager, he played in punk bands, and in college, wrote about music for the prescient indie zine \"Forced Exposure.\" While attending Northwestern in the early '80s, he founded the abrasive, noisy post-punk band Big Black, known for its mordant riffs, violent and taboo lyrics and drum machine in lieu of a live drummer. It was a controversial innovation at the time, from a man whose career would be defined by risky choices. The band\u00b4s best-known song, the ugly, explosive, six-minute \"Kerosene\" from their cult favorite album, 1986's \"Atomizer,\" is ideal evidence - and not for the faint of heart.\n\nThen came the short lived band Rapeman - one of two groups Albini fronted with indefensibly offensive names and vulgar song titles. In the early \u00b490s, he formed Shellac, the ferocious, distorted noise-rock band - an evolution from Big Black, but still punctuated by pummeling guitar tones and aggressive vocals.\n\nIn 1997, Albini opened his famed studio, Electrical Audio, in Chicago.\n\n\"The recording part is the part that matters to me - that I\u00b4m making a document that records a piece of our culture, the life\u00b4s work of the musicians that are hiring me,\" Albini told The Guardian last year, when asked about some of the well-known and much-loved albums he's recorded. \"I take that part very seriously. I want the music to outlive all of us.\"\n\nAlbini was a larger-than-life character in the independent rock music scene, known for his forward-thinking productions, unapologetic irreverence, acerbic sense of humor and criticisms of the music industry\u00b4s exploitative practices - as detailed in his landmark 1993 essay \"The Problem with Music\" - as much as his talents.\n\nLater in life, he became a notable poker player and apologetic for his past indiscretions.\n\n\"Ugh man, a heartbreaking loss of a legend. Love to his family and innumerable colleagues,\" wrote actor Elijah Woodon X. \"Farewell, Steve Albini.\"\n\nAuthor Michael Azerrad, who included a chapter on Big Black in his comprehensive history, \"Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981-1991,\" also posted on X. \"I don\u00b4t know what to say about Steve Albini\u00b4s passing,\" Azerrad wrote. \"He had a brilliant mind, was a great artist and underwent the most remarkable and inspiring personal transformation. I can\u00b4t believe he\u00b4s gone.\"\n\nAlbini is survived by his wife, Heather Whinna, a filmmaker.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

He was 61.\n\nBrian Fox, an engineer at Albini's studio, Electrical Audio Recording, said Wednesday that Albini died after a heart attack Tuesday night.\n\nIn addition to his work on canonized rock albums such as Nirvana 's \"In Utero,\" the Pixies' breakthrough \"Surfer Rosa,\" and PJ Harvey's \"Rid of Me,\" Albini was the frontman of the underground bands Big Black and Shellac.\n\nHe dismissed the term \"producer,\" refused to take royalties from the albums he worked on, and requested he be credited with \"Recorded by Steve Albini,\" a fabled label on albums he worked on.\n\nAt the time of his death, Albini's band Shellac were preparing to tour their first new album in a decade, \"To All Trains,\" which releases next week.\n\nOther acts whose music was shaped by Albini include Joanna Newsom's indie-folk opus, \"Ys,\" and releases from bands like the Breeders, the Jesus Lizard, Hum, Superchunk, Low and Mogwai.\n\nAlbini was born in California, grew up in Montana, and fell in love with the do-it-yourself punk music scene in Chicago while studying journalism at Northwestern University.\n\nAs a teenager, he played in punk bands, and in college, wrote about music for the prescient indie zine \"Forced Exposure.\" While attending Northwestern in the early '80s, he founded the abrasive, noisy post-punk band Big Black, known for its mordant riffs, violent and taboo lyrics and drum machine in lieu of a live drummer. It was a controversial innovation at the time, from a man whose career would be defined by risky choices. The band's best-known song, the ugly, explosive, six-minute \"Kerosene\" from their cult favorite album, 1986's \"Atomizer,\" is ideal evidence -- and not for the faint of heart.\n\nThen came the short lived band Rapeman -- one of two groups Albini fronted with indefensibly offensive names and vulgar song titles. In the early '90s, he formed Shellac, the ferocious, distorted noise-rock band -- an evolution from Big Black, but still punctuated by pummeling guitar tones and aggressive vocals.\n\nIn 1997, Albini opened his famed studio, Electrical Audio, in Chicago.\n\n\"The recording part is the part that matters to me -- that I'm making a document that records a piece of our culture, the life's work of the musicians that are hiring me,\" Albini told The Guardian last year, when asked about some of the well-known and much-loved albums he's recorded. \"I take that part very seriously. I want the music to outlive all of us.\"\n\nAlbini was a larger-than-life character in the independent rock music scene, known for his forward-thinking productions, unapologetic irreverence, acerbic sense of humor and criticisms of the music industry's exploitative practices -- as detailed in his landmark 1993 essay \"The Problem with Music\" -- as much as his talents.\n\nLater in life, he became a notable poker player and apologetic for his past indiscretions.\n\n\"Ugh man, a heartbreaking loss of a legend. Love to his family and innumerable colleagues,\" wrote actor Elijah Woodon X. \"Farewell, Steve Albini.\"\n\nAuthor Michael Azerrad, who included a chapter on Big Black in his comprehensive history, \"Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981-1991,\" also posted on X. \"I don't know what to say about Steve Albini's passing,\" Azerrad wrote. \"He had a brilliant mind, was a great artist and underwent the most remarkable and inspiring personal transformation.

He was 61 years old.\n\nBrian Fox, an engineer at Albini's studio, Electrical Audio Recording, said Wednesday that Albini died after suffering a heart attack Tuesday evening.\n\nIn addition to his work on canonized rock albums such as NirvanaIn Utero, Surfer Rosa, the Pixies' breakthrough, and PJ Harvey's Rid of Me, Albini was the frontman for underground bands Big Black and Shellac.\n\nHe rejected the term producer, refused to collect royalties from albums he worked on, and demanded that he be credited to Recorded by Steve Albini, a legendary label. on the albums he worked on.\n\nAt the time of his death, Albinis' band Shellac was preparing to tour their first new album in a decade, To All Trains, which will be released next week.\n\nOther bands whose music has been shaped by Albini include Joanna Newsom's indie-folk opus Ys, and releases from bands like Breedersthe Jesus Lizard, Hum, Superchunk, Low and Mogwai.\n\nAlbini was born in California, raised in Montana, and fell in love with Chicago's DIY punk music scene while studying journalism at Northwestern University.\n\nAs a teenager, he played in punk bands and, in college, wrote about music for the prescient indie zine Forced Exposure. While attending Northwestern in the early '80s, he founded the abrasive and noisy post-punk band Big Black, known for its biting riffs, violent and taboo lyrics, and its drum machine in place of a live drummer . It was a controversial innovation at the time, from a man whose career would be defined by risky choices. The band's best-known song, the gruesome and bombastic six-minute Kerosene from their cult favorite album, 1986's Atomizer, is ideal proof and is not for the faint of heart.\n\nThen came the short-lived Rapeman, one of two Albini groups sporting indefensibly offensive names and vulgar song titles. In the early '90s, he formed Shellac, a fierce, distorted noise-rock band, an evolution of Big Black, but still punctuated with punchy guitar sounds and aggressive vocals.\n\nIn 1997, Albini opened his famous studio, Electrical Audio, in Chicago.\n\nThe recording part is the part that matters to me because I am making a document that records a piece of our culture, the life work of the musicians who hire me, Albini told the Guardian last year, when he was asked about some of the best-known and best-loved albums he's recorded. I take this part very seriously. I want music to survive us all.\n\nAlbini was a larger-than-life figure in the independent rock music scene, known for his avant-garde productions, unabashed irreverence, acerbic sense of humor, and criticism of the music industry's exploitative practices, such as detailed in his landmark 1993 essay, The Problem with Music. as much as his talents.\n\nLater in life, he became a notable poker player. and sorry for his past indiscretions.\n\nUgh man, a heartbreaking loss of a legend. Love to his family and countless colleagues, the actor wrote Elijah Wood on. Farewell, Steve Albini.\n\nAuthor Michael Azerrad, who included a chapter on Big Black in his comprehensive history, Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes From the American Indie Underground, 1981-1991, also posted on X. I don't know what to say about the passing of Steve Albinis, Azerrad wrote. He had a brilliant mind, was a great artist, and underwent a most remarkable and inspiring personal transformation. I can't believe he's gone.\n\nThe memories came immediately online, especially from her beloved Chicago.\n\nDamon Locks, director of the Chicago-based Black Monument Ensemble, a multi-generational music collective aimed at honoring the city's black music, wrote of Albini on Instagram: He was a human (and a punk icon) who was doing the work, evolving, and serving a larger idea, I admire that he continued to evaluate and change over time. He had a philosophy. He stood for something. He was a good guy. It's so shocking.\n\nThe city's independent music venue, Metro, announced it had changed its front sign to honor Albini. We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Steve Albinis and hold his family in our hearts. Thank you for everything you have contributed to punk rock in our city and for the ripples of creativity you have sparked that have been felt around the world.\n\nAlbini is survived by his wife,

The band's best-known song, the ugly, explosive, six-minute \"Kerosene\" from their cult favorite album, 1986's \"Atomizer,\" is ideal evidence -- and not for the faint of heart.\n\nThen came the short-lived band Rapeman -- one of two groups Albini fronted with indefensibly offensive names and vulgar song titles. In the early '90s, he formed Shellac, the ferocious, distorted noise-rock band -- an evolution from Big Black, but still punctuated by pummeling guitar tones and aggressive vocals.\n\nIn 1997, Albini opened his famed studio, Electrical Audio, in Chicago.\n\n\"The recording part is the part that matters to me -- that I'm making a document that records a piece of our culture, the life's work of the musicians that are hiring me,\" Albini told The Guardian last year, when asked about some of the well-known and much-loved albums he's recorded. \"I take that part very seriously. I want the music to outlive all of us.\"\n\nAlbini was a larger-than-life character in the independent rock music scene, known for his forward-thinking productions, unapologetic irreverence, acerbic sense of humor and criticisms of the music industry's exploitative practices -- as detailed in his landmark 1993 essay \"The Problem with Music\" -- as much as his talents.\n\nLater in life, he became a notable poker player and apologetic for his past indiscretions.\n\n\"Ugh man, a heartbreaking loss of a legend. Love to his family and innumerable colleagues,\" wrote actor Elijah Woodon X. \"Farewell, Steve Albini.\"\n\nAuthor Michael Azerrad, who included a chapter on Big Black in his comprehensive history, \"Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981-1991,\" also posted on X. \"I don't know what to say about Steve Albini's passing,\" Azerrad wrote. \"He had a brilliant mind, was a great artist and underwent the most remarkable and inspiring personal transformation. I can't believe he's gone.\"\n\nAlbini is survived by his wife, Heather Whinna, a filmmaker.", "source": {"uri": "kcra.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KCRA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In recent months, the musician has been working on the forthcoming album, To All Trains, by his band Shellac. The project is set to arrive on May 17th and marks their first record in a decade.\n\nNews of his death was first reported by Pitchfork, who were told of his passing by staff who work at his recording studio. As of yet, no statement has been released by his family regarding the death of the underground rock icon.\n\nAs an engineer, Albini worked on thousands of records throughout his storied career and despite achieving mass acclaim thanks to albums such as Surfer Rosa by Pixies and In Utero by Nirvana, he continued to choose to work with countless unsigned acts.\n\nAlbini first courted attention in the 1980s with punk rock outfit Big Black, who released two albums before parting ways. He then went onto form Rapeman, who released Two Nuns and a Pack Mule in 1988, and Albini later shared his regret over their band name. Since 1992, he has been a member of Shellac.\n\nWith Shellac, who are the heaviest of all bands that Albini was involved in, he released five albums and their sixth record is set for release posthumously later this month.\n\nThroughout the entire of his professional career, Albini constantly worked with other acts on the side as a producer and engineer. While he was incredibly successful in this regard, helping transform the Pixies from obscurity into household name status with Surfer Rosa, Albini refused to sell out on his principles and detested the major label system fiercely.\n\nWhile speaking at the Face the Music conference in Melbourne, Australia, in 2015, Albini remarked: \"I don't feel like I'm part of the music industry, the music industry meaning the corporatised business structures where you have people who are in the lower level, people in the upper level, people in administration, and people making legal relationships between all those people.\"\n\nHe continued: \"All of that has always really bothered me. When I think about it, it makes me angry that it exists as a parasite on the music scene, which is the fans, bands, shows, and the people who help them. That all feels very organic to me, fraternal and comfortable.\"\n\nMost notably, Albini produced Nirvana's third and final album, In Utero, released in 1993. At the time, the Seattle group were the biggest rock act in the world, and Kurt Cobain viewed Albini as the perfect person to help them return to their punk rock roots. While he'd typically not work with a band of that stature, he made an exception for Nirvana after they agreed to his strict conditions.\n\nIn a four-page letter addressed to the band, which later surfaced, Albini wrote: \"I think the very best thing you could do at this point is exactly what you are talking about doing: bang a record out in a couple of days, with high quality but minimal 'production' and no interference from the front office bulletheads. If that is indeed what you want to do, I would love to be involved.\"\n\nIn Utero was a phenomenal success, which should have made Albino's demand increase further. However, strangely, his approach made major labels run scared, and smaller bands feel he was too big to work with them, landing him in a perilous financial position.\n\nThankfully, in 1997, Led Zeppelin duo Robert Plant and Jimmy Page came to the rescue when they recruited him to serve as an engineer on their album, Walking into Clarksdale. This LP put his career back on track, and proved his versatility as an engineer, who was capable of stepping out of the punk rock scene.\n\nIn recent decades, Albini worked with a wide-range of acts such as Code Orange, Black Midi, Laura Jane Grace, The Cribs, Metz, Sunn O))), The Breeders, Fuzz, Ty Segall, Jarvis Cocker, Manic Street Preachers and The Stooges.\n\nOutside of his vast musical achievements, Albini was also a celebrated poker player and won over $100,000 at the World Series of Poker in 2018. Four years later, he bettered this tally by taking home $196,089 at the same competition. He is survived by his wife, Heather Whinna.", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_taysom@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name":

The cause of death has been ruled a heart attack.\n\nFollowing a bout on the zine scene, Steve Albini hit the music world full force in the 1980s, founding pivotal punk band Big Black, which helped evolve the genre past expectations and was a seminal band of the post-hardcore movement. He, too, formed Shellac in the early '90s.\n\nBut outside of these bands, Steve Albini was by far better known to music lovers of the era for his work as an engineer. The first major record he worked on was the Pixies' Surfer Rosa in 1988, an album so influential for Nirvana that they insisted on bringing Albini on board for their Nevermind follow-up, In Utero, with Kurt Cobain himself noting that the drums alone would be enough to change their sound. As such, In Utero had a rawness that Nevermind lacked, marking a key (but ultimately late) transition for the grunge era.\n\nSteve Albini would also work on a number of other remarkable albums from the '90s, including The Breeders' Pod and PJ Harvey's Rid of Me. I would also personally recommend his work on albums by The Jesus Lizard and Silkworm, two bands that never get their due credit. Albini himself estimated that he had worked on records. Unfortunately, neither Big Black nor Shellac are on Spotify, but we'd encourage you to give a listen to as much of his work as you can to get an idea of just what sort of sound he promoted.\n\nOn his legacy and what music means, Steve Albini said, No doubt the legacy of Albini will live on as more generations discover his sounds and his influence.\n\nWhat are your favorite Steve Albini albums or songs?

Rivian receives $827M state incentive package to expand operations in Normal\n\nAt the time of his death, Albini's band Shellac were preparing to tour their first new album in a decade, \"To All Trains,\" which releases next week.\n\nOther acts whose music was shaped by Albini include Joanna Newsom's indie-folk opus, \"Ys,\" and releases from bands like the Breeders, the Jesus Lizard, Hum, Superchunk, Low and Mogwai.\n\nAlbini was born in California, grew up in Montana, and fell in love with the do-it-yourself punk music scene in Chicago while studying journalism at Northwestern University.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAs a teenager, he played in punk bands, and in college, wrote about music for the prescient indie zine \"Forced Exposure.\" While attending Northwestern in the early '80s, he founded the abrasive, noisy post-punk band Big Black, known for its mordant riffs, violent and taboo lyrics and drum machine in lieu of a live drummer. It was a controversial innovation at the time, from a man whose career would be defined by risky choices. The band's best-known song, the ugly, explosive, six-minute \"Kerosene\" from their cult favorite album, 1986's \"Atomizer,\" is ideal evidence -- and not for the faint of heart.\n\nThen came the short lived band Rapeman -- one of two groups Albini fronted with indefensibly offensive names and vulgar song titles. In the early '90s, he formed Shellac, the ferocious, distorted noise-rock band -- an evolution from Big Black, but still punctuated by pummeling guitar tones and aggressive vocals.\n\nIn 1997, Albini opened his famed studio, Electrical Audio, in Chicago.\n\n\"The recording part is the part that matters to me -- that I'm making a document that records a piece of our culture, the life's work of the musicians that are hiring me,\" Albini told The Guardian last year, when asked about some of the well-known and much-loved albums he's recorded. \"I take that part very seriously. I want the music to outlive all of us.\"\n\nAlbini was a larger-than-life character in the independent rock music scene, known for his forward-thinking productions, unapologetic irreverence, acerbic sense of humor and criticisms of the music industry's exploitative practices -- as detailed in his landmark 1993 essay \"The Problem with Music\" -- as much as his talents.\n\nLater in life, he became a notable poker player and apologetic for his past indiscretions.\n\n\"Ugh man, a heartbreaking loss of a legend. Love to his family and innumerable colleagues,\" wrote actor Elijah Woodon X. \"Farewell, Steve Albini.\"\n\nAuthor Michael Azerrad, who included a chapter on Big Black in his comprehensive history, \"Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981-1991,\" also posted on X. \"I don't know what to say about Steve Albini's passing,\" Azerrad wrote. \"He had a brilliant mind, was a great artist and underwent the most remarkable and inspiring personal transformation. I can't believe he's gone.\"\n\nAlbini is survived by his wife, Heather Whinna, a filmmaker.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He did not take royalties from records he worked on. The rock world says goodbye to a true legend.\n\nIndie rock icon and record producer Steve Albini has died at the age of 61.\n\nAlbini died of a heart attack at his recording studio, the Electronic Audio, in Chicago.\n\nHe was a larger-than-life character in the independent rock music scene, known for his forward-thinking productions, unapologetic irreverence, and sense of humour. He was most well known for being the producer of major albums such as Nirvana's final studio record 'In Utero', Pixies' debut 'Surfer Rosa', and PJ Harvey's 'Rid of Me'.\n\nBorn in Pasadena, California in 1962, Albini was part of various bands throughout his teenage years. He played in punk bands, and in college, wrote about music for the prescient indie zine \"Forced Exposure.\"\n\nHe received a degree in journalism at Northwestern University in Illinois, and engineered his first album in 1981 (Albini disliked the term \"producer\", preferring the title \"engineer\").\n\nAlbini frequently criticised the music industry's exploitative practices - as detailed in his landmark 1993 essay \"The Problem with Music\". He did not take royalties from records he worked on, and he kept his day rates low.\n\nSpeaking in 2018, Albini said he had worked on more than 2,000 albums, mostly for underground or indie bands.\n\nHe also performed in his own bands including Big Black and his most recent project, Shellac.\n\nShellac had just finished recording a new album, 'To All Trains', due for release next week (17 May), and the group were set to tour the record prior to Albini's death, according to the music website Pitchfork.\n\nAmong the tributes, Pixies posted a photo of him on X, with the caption RIP Steve Albini, while The Lord Of The Rings star Elijah Wood wrote: \"Ugh man, a heartbreaking loss of a legend. Love to his family and innumerable colleagues. Farewell, Steve Albini.\"\n\nRetail chain of record shops in the UK and US Rough Trade wrote on X: \"Musician, studio engineer and the mastermind behind some of rock's greatest albums. A hero to us all. Thank you for setting the standard so high. RIP Steve Albini. Deeply missed, forever loved.\"\n\nFans also started resharing his proposal for producing Nirvana's 'In Utero' following the news of his death.\n\nAlbini wrote a four-page proposal to the grunge trio when he agreed to work on 'In Utero' with them in which he explained his philosophies around recording music. Most notably, he declared that \"if a record takes more than a week to make, somebody's fucking up\".\n\n\"I think the very best thing you could do at this point is exactly what you are talking about doing: bang a record out in a couple of days, with high quality but minimal 'production' and no interference from the front office bulletheads,\" he wrote. \"If that is indeed what you want to do, I would love to be involved.\"\n\n\"If, instead, you might find yourselves in the position of being temporarily indulged by the record company, only to have them yank the chain at some point (hassling you to rework songs/sequences/production, calling-in hired guns to 'sweeten' your record, turning the whole thing over to some remix jockey, whatever...) then you're in for a bummer and I want no part of it.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I'm only interested in working on records that legitimately reflect the band's own perception of their music and existence. If you will commit yourselves to that as a tenet of the recording methodology, then I will bust my ass for you. I'll work circles around you. I'll rap your head with a ratchet...\"\n\nHe also spoke about money, writing: \"I do not want and will not take a royalty on any record I record. No points. Period. I think paying a royalty to a producer or engineer is ethically indefensible. The band write the songs. The band play the music. It's the band's fans who buy the records. The band is responsible for whether it's a great record or a horrible record. Royalties belong to the band.\"\n\n\"I would like to be paid like a plumber: I do the job and you pay me what it's worth.\"\n\nAlbini is survived by his wife, filmmaker Heather Whinna.", "source":

He was 61.\n\nStaff at the studio, Electrical Audio, have confirmed to Pitchfork that Albini died on Tuesday.\n\nThe late musician fronted bands such as Big Black, Rapeman and Shellac, while he also produced albums for the likes of Nirvana, Pixies, PJ Harvey, and Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.\n\nAlbini was heavily influenced by the punk movement during his younger years, and he ultimately founded his own music project called Big Black, firstly as a solo effort before it eventually became a quartet.\n\nThe group released their debut album, \"Atomizer\" in 1986, and they're now recognized as one of the most influential punk groups of the era.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nDespite this, the group split and in 1987, Albini formed a new band called Rapeman.\n\nAlbini then formed Shellac in 1992 alongside drummer Todd Trainer and bassist Bob Weston. Together, they released five albums and the group are actually scheduled to release their latest record, \"To All Trains,\" next week.\n\nAlbini is probably best know for producing the final studio album by Nirvana, \"In Utero,\" which was released in 1993.\n\nIn 1995, Albini established his own recording studio and he worked with several high-profile acts, including Joanna Newsom, Low, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Manic Street Preachers and Jarvis Cocker.\n\nAway from the music scene, Albini also enjoyed huge success as a poker player, winning two bracelets at World Series of Poker tournaments, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money.\n\nAlbini is survived by his wife, movie-maker Heather Whinna.\n\nTags Broadcasting And Telecommunications Radio And Tv Broadcasting Entertainment And Leisure Lee-national Dcc Wire Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!

The news was confirmed to Variety on Wednesday by Taylor Hales, who works at Albini's Chicago recording studio, Electronic Audio.\n\nAlbini first rose to acclaim in the early 1980s as the frontman for Big Black, the Chicago-based trio known for aggressive guitar-based rock that worked with a drum machine rather than a live drummer, a rarity for the time. Yet he was also well known for his equally aggressive criticism of musicians and others who he felt were in it for the money or popularity rather than the music -- and he walked it like he talked it. He reviled the term \"producer,\" even if that's arguably what he did on many recordings, and insisted on a \"Recorded by Steve Albini\" credit and declined any \"points\" -- i.e. royalties from the recordings he recorded -- which is a common financial bonus for most producers.\n\nHis at-times iconoclastic stance -- and his galvanizing work on the Pixies' landmark 1988 album \"Surfer Rosa\" -- endeared him to Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, who insisted that the band work with Albini on its second major label album, 1993's \"In Utero,\" which turned out to be Nirvana's last studio album.\n\nAlbini also worked with acts such as Pixies, the Breeders, PJ Harvey, the Jesus Lizard, Mclusky, and even former Led Zeppelin members Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.\n\nLater in the In the 1990s he formed the band Shellac.\n\nAlbini was also the founder, owner and principal engineer at Electrical Audio, a recording studio complex in Chicago. Even now, Albini was still consistently taking up production gigs for a flat fee, refusing royalty payments in a show of support with his indie artists.\n\nAlbini was preparing for a tour with Shellac later this year to support their first album in a decade, \"To All Trains,\" which is scheduled for release next week.", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Black", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Big Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shellac (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drum machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indie rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ_Harvey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PJ Harvey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recording studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronic music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pixies (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drummer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mclusky", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mclusky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_Audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrical Audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_Lizard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Jesus Lizard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_and_Plant", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Page and Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breeders", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Breeders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Led Zeppelin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Cobain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Cobain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-596734390.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The news of his passing was confirmed by staff at his Electrical Audio studio. He was 61.\n\nSteve Albini was born in Pasadena, California, on July 22, 1962. His passion for music began when he started playing bass guitar while recovering from a broken leg as a teenager.\n\nAlbini then became involved in the punk rock scene in Chicago during his time as a student at nearby Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. There, he started his first group, Big Black, before creating two other bands during the '80s and early '90s: Rapeman (whose name he would later come to regret) and the better known Shellac.\n\n\"It was an extremely active, very fertile scene where everybody was participating on every level,\" said Albini. \"The community that I joined when I came to Chicago enabled me to continue on with a life in music. I didn't do this by myself.\"\n\nBut it was his expertise as a recording engineer that would really see him come to be revered for his work producing other artists' music. Albini preferred the term \"engineer\" rather than \"producer,\" since the title of producer does not necessarily denote technical acumen.\n\nHe founded his own recording studio, Electrical Audio, in 1995. Among the most notable acts with whom he worked include Nirvana, the Pixies, PJ Harvey, and Jimmy Page and Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin fame. His work on Nirvana's In Utero, despite distinguishing it from the band's earlier work and other grunge music of the time, ultimately made him persona non grata with major labels for many years afterward, Albini said in 2021.\n\nStill, Steve Albini might have steered clear of the major music labels, regardless. As an outspoken critic of the corporate music industry, he described in his 1993 essay \"The Problem With Music\" the many hoops and red tape facing new musicians -- many of which have only continued to today, albeit with the added nuances of the streaming age.\n\n\"[Steve] spent the last 40 years helping people make art,\" wrote Dylan Baldi of Cloud Nothings, whose 2012 album Attack On Memory was engineered by Albini. \"There's no reason for him to be gone, and the world is less interesting without him. Just a really sad day.\"\n\nShare on:\n\nFacebook Twitter LinkedIn Copy Link", "source": {"uri": "digitalmusicnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Music News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_king@digitalmusicnews.com", "name": "Ashley King", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pixies (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_Audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrical Audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ_Harvey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PJ Harvey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bass guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pasadena, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pasadena, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapeman", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shellac (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medill_School_of_Journalism", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medill School of Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Black", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punk rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Nothings", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud Nothings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_and_Plant", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Page and Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Led Zeppelin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recording studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grunge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grunge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Related_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Related Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/iconic-producer-steve-albini-nirvana-pixies-dies-age-61-feat.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

He was also the founder and owner of Electrical Audio, which, in a newly released company statement, said the studio is struggling to process the loss.\n\n\"Steve was a hero to all of us, our friend and mentor. He was one of the greatest living recording engineers, tirelessly dedicated to capturing the creative work of the bands and artists he worked with. He saw recording almost as an ethical imperative to document the music of the world around him.\"\n\nThe studio reflected on Mr. Albini's expertise and knowledge, thanking him for giving the company a chance in a cut-throat, dwindling industry and advocating for others in this realm.\n\nMr. Albini fronted for indie bands Big Black and Shellac, and despite not favoring being called a \"producer,\" he notably recorded for Nirvana, Pixies, and PJ Harvey, among many others.\n\nUp until his final days, Mr. Albini remained active in the music scene, becoming an outspoken critic of exploitative industry practices.\n\nAdditionally, he was gearing up to tour with Shellac later this year in honor of their sixth full-length studio album.\n\nMr. Albini first rose to acclaim in the early 1980s, fronting for Big Black, channeling aggressive guitar-based rock whose sound was backed only by a drum machine. This drew attention at the time as using that method rather than a live drummer was a rarity.\n\nHe faced some controversy throughout his career, however, as he strove to achieve unique sounds, all while creating provocative and shocking songs or band names.\n\nInstead of the common title of \"producer,\" he insisted on his credits being \"Recorded by Steve Albini\" and declined any royalties from the recordings he worked on.\n\nIn 1988, Mr. Albini worked with the Pixies on their landmark album \"Surfer Rosa,\" which influenced the alt-rock sound going into the '90s. This caught the eye of the late Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, who insisted the band work with him on its second major album \"In Utero.\"\n\nAround this time, Mr. Albini founded and fronted Shellac, where the band recorded and toured extensively into the 2000s.\n\nMr. Albini championed for all musicians who worked with him to remain true to themselves, and ultimately, his love for the indie rock genre led the way to success.\n\nSome popular bands under Mr. Albini's resume include the Breeders, the Jesus Lizard, Mclusky, and former Led Zeppelin members Jimmy Page and Robert Plant on their 1998 album.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shellac (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_Audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electrical Audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Black", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Underground music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recording studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_vocalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lead vocalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pixies (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ_Harvey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PJ Harvey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mclusky", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mclusky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_Lizard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Jesus Lizard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_and_Plant", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Page and Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breeders", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Breeders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Led Zeppelin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drum machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indie rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drummer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alternative rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Cobain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Cobain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/08/id5646544-Steve-Albini--1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 333, "textEnd": 338}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Albini, who produced albums by Nirvana, the Pixies and PJ Harvey, died Tuesday, May 7, 2024, at age 61. (Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune/TNS)\n\nSteve Albini, the record producer and engineer behind generation-defining rock albums by Nirvana, the Pixies and PJ Harvey, died Tuesday. He was 61.\n\nA representative for Electrical Audio, Albini's Chicago recording studio, confirmed Albini's death following a heart attack on Tuesday. The representative did not have available a further statement or a list of survivors.\n\nAlbini was a giant of punk and experimental rock music from the '80s to the present day. He produced (or as he preferred to call his job, \"engineered\") Nirvana's final studio album, \"In Utero,\" selected by the band for his raw, uncompromising aesthetic. Albums like the Pixies' \"Surfer Rosa\" and PJ Harvey's \"Rid of Me\" felt bracing and dangerous then, and continue to inspire young rockers today for their seething energy and defiance of pop audio convention.\n\n\"I've gotten exactly one phone call out of a No. 1 record,\" Albini told The Times in 1993. \"It shows how pack-like these major-label people are. They all think the same thing: 'That Albini guy is trouble. Stay away.'\"\n\nAlbini, raised in Missoula, Montana, was the son of a rocket scientist father and inherited his engineer's meticulousness. The young Albini, smart and disenchanted with the local conservative culture, discovered punk through music magazines and found safe harbor for misfits. After moving to Chicago to attend Northwestern University for journalism, he rose to scene prominence as an artist in the scabrous groups Big Black and Shellac, which emerged from the fertile post-hardcore underground alongside bands like Sonic Youth, Butthole Surfers and the Minutemen.\n\nSnarling and sneering through big horn-rim glasses, yet just as ambitious and uncorruptable as he was abrasive, Albini became a star in the underground. \"How many boys want to be whipped by Steve Albini's guitar?\" Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon told the Village Voice in 1988.\n\n\"Big Black introduced one of the indie world's foremost characters,\" wrote Michael Azerrad in the definitive indie-punk scene biography, \"Our Band Could Be Your Life.\" \"A person who would define not just the sound of underground music through the next two decades, but also its discourse -- the irascible, outspoken, intelligent and relentlessly ethical Steve Albini.\"\n\nShellac in particular was a formative influence for countless punk, metal, electronic and noise bands. The group's 1994 LP \"At Action Park\" was a brutal read on post-punk, its minimalist yet seething power-trio instrumentation slinking with menace.\n\nAlbini paired his dedication to the most vicious, arresting sounds possible with a workmanlike professionalism as a producer in his studio, Electrical Audio. He was famous for wearing a mechanic-style jumpsuit to sessions, an overt gesture at how he saw his role.\n\n\"I've always had a fairly standard method,\" he said of his recording techniques. \"I have a straightforward, documentary approach to recording music, and I've never been tempted with my own bands or with anyone else's band to suddenly go production-happy. If you let the band sound natural, then the record will sink or swim on its own merits. ... The things I like most about rock bands are simplicity and straightforwardness, and those principles guide my recordings.\"\"\n\nHe was a ferocious advocate for artists. A famous essay in the Baffler, \"The Problem With Music,\" laid out the perfidies of the major-label system, at the time still in a post-Nirvana feeding frenzy for young rock acts.\n\n\"Whenever I talk to a band who are about to sign with a major label, I always end up thinking of them in a particular context,\" Albini wrote. \"I imagine a trench, about four feet wide and five feet deep, maybe sixty yards long, filled with runny, decaying s -- . I imagine these people, some of them good friends, some of them barely acquaintances, at one end of this trench. I also imagine a faceless industry lackey at the other end, holding a fountain pen and a contract waiting to be signed.\"\n\n\"In Utero,\" Nirvana's follow-up to the the epochal \"Nevermind,\" bridged the gap between the underground music Kurt Cobain loved and the expectations placed on the biggest band in the world. \"Feeling uncomfortable with this new world of Nirvana fame,\" drummer Dave Grohl said in an interview last year. \"When things did become huge, we all sort of clung to the things we felt most attached to. We had always listened to records Steve had made.\"\n\nAlbini's catalog spans decades of fierce and fearless rock and experimental records, from Slint and Jesus Lizard to Low, Mogwai and Joanna Newsom. He wrote and recorded up to his death. Shellac was about to tour around its first album in a decade, \"To All Trains,\" which will be released next week.\n\n\"What matters to me is that I do things in a way that I feel is -- for lack of a better word -- righteous,\" Albini told The Times. \"Everything that I do, I do basically with the same goal: I want to make better, cheaper punk-rock records today than I did yesterday.\"", "source":

He was 61 years old.\n\nAlbini formed his first band, Big Black, in 1981. He also sang and played guitar in the '90s noise-rock band Shellac, which is scheduled to release its sixth studio album, To All Trains, on May 17. But his most notable work was in producing and engineering \"some of the greatest alternative rock albums of all time,\" as Rolling Stone notes. (Throughout his career, he preferred the title \"engineer\" or \"producing engineer\" as opposed to \"producer.\")\n\nHe was best known for his work on Nirvana's third and final album, 1993's In Utero; the Pixies' 1988 album Surfer Rosa; PJ Harvey's 1993 sophomore release Rid of Me and other works by the Jesus Lizard, Superchunk and Low. He also produced records by Canadian artists Thrush Hermit, the Sadies, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Metz and Ken Mode.\n\nWhile Albini continued to produce and engineer until his death, most recently working on records by metal bands Code Orange and Liturgy and rock artists like Laura Jane Grace and Black Midi, the Chicago-based figure will be most remembered for shaping the alternative rock sound of the '90s.\n\nBelow are reactions to Albini's death and tributes to his musical legacy from musicians, journalists, friends and admirers.\n\nGeorge Strombolopolous called Albini \"a custodian of original intent.\"\n\nThe Pixies, who worked with Albini on albums including 1988's Surfer Rosa and 1997's Death to the Pixies, shared a brief tribute.\n\nJack White also kept it brief, posting a photo of a young Albini.\n\nWinnipeg metal act Ken Mode, whose 2015 album Success was produced by Albini (and earned them a Juno Award nomination for heavy metal album of the year), said it was \"a dream come true\" to make a record with him.\n\nToronto rock band Metz, who worked with Albini on their 2017 album Strange Peace, paid tribute in an Instagram post. \"His approach to making records/music was an inspiration to so many and his body of work is truly second to none,\" the band wrote. \"He was infamously acerbic and outspoken, uncompromising, and deeply funny.\"\n\nJournalist Ann Powers looks back at his legacy, referring to him as a \"titan.\"\n\nFormer CBC Music host Raina Douris recalls an interview she did with Albini last year for NPR's World Cafe.\n\nToronto rockers F--ked Up praised Albini even though, according to the post, he \"hated our band.\"\n\nRobin Hatch, who has toured with F--ked Up, Our Lady Peace and Porno For Pyros, called Albini the \"greatest producer of alternative rock.\"\n\nJarvis Cocker, who teamed up with Albini on his 2009 album Further Complications, posted a photo of Albini's Chicago studio, noting that working with him \"was an education in many ways: the technical aspects of recording sound, for sure -- but also lessons in how to live & work at making music without being destroyed by the Music Business.\"\n\nSuperchunk and Mountain Goats drummer Jon Wurster shared a sweet memory of Albini.\n\nWurster's Superchunkbandmate Mac McCaughan wrote a heartfelt tribute. \"In all of our working with him, Steve was not particularly interested in 2 things the music industry is obsessed with -- credit and money,\" McCaughan said. \"He recommended we *not* put his name on our record because he said it would turn off as many people as it would interest. What he *was* interested in was helping people document their art and make it sound real.

He was 61 years old. It has been reported that Albini was at work in his studio, Electric Audio, when the heart attack occurred. Staff at the studio went on to confirm Albini's passing to the media.\n\nAlbini initially came to prominence as a musician in the Chicago punk and noise scene in the early 80s. He fronted three bands across his career: Big Black, Rapeman and Shellac, the lattermost of which was planning to tour this year and release their sixth studio album To All Trains. He also sat in on bass for the projects Pegboy and Flour at various points throughout the 90s.\n\nIn the mid-80s, Albini turned his focus to engineering albums for other bands. He would go on to work on dozens of albums now considered classics in the alternative rock pantheon - among them Nirvana's In Utero, the Pixies' Surfer Rosa, The Breeders' Pod, PJ Harvey's Rid of Me, Dirty Three's Ocean Songs, mclusky's mclusky Do Dallas and Cloud Nothings' Attack On Memory.\n\nThe news of Albini's passing has seen tributes flood in from across the music community. Jon Wurster - whose former band, Superchunk, worked with Albini on multiple projects - described him as \"a good, caring, and funny guy\" on Twitter. \"I will always treasure the night in '99 when he took me to Second City to see a show,\" he wrote. \"I walked into the Electrical kitchen at the agreed upon departure time and he looked at my head, smiled and said, 'Your hair is peak Mellencamp'.\"\n\n\"Steve recorded our first album, and that record changed our lives,\" wrote Andrew Wilson of New Zealand post-punk band Die! Die! Die! \"I remember being at Mikey [Prain, drummer]'s parents' house in Dunedin, calling Electrical Audio to book the recording. I was surprised when Steve answered the phone himself. I found that so fucking inspiring, just like everything he did: his choice of guitars, his bands, the way he recorded music, who he recorded and how he wasn't shy about sharing his opinions on music he didn't like. Everything.\"\n\n\"It's so hard to imagine Steve Albini being gone,\" wrote The Cribs, who worked with Albini on their album In the Bell of the Brazen Bull. \"He has been an almost constant touchstone in the lives of us brothers ever since we first heard one of his albums as 13 year old kids. His commitment was to the artist - and in that regard he was unparalleled. Working with him was a dream - he was the greatest engineer in the world, that goes without saying, but it was his respect and commitment to the art of recording that really set him apart.\"\n\nAlbini's final album that he worked on that was released during his lifetime was Code Orange's 2023 studio album The Above. \"Thank you for your kindness,\" the band wrote in tribute on Instagram, sharing a video of them having a conversation with Albini in the studio. \"You provided us with an amazing experience when we truly needed one.

This is a photo of the building that contains Electrical Audio: the recording studio established by Steve Albini in Chicago.\"\n\n\"I took this photo during January 2009 when we were recording the 'Further Complications' album there. Working with Steve Albini was an education in many ways: the technical aspects of recording sound, for sure - but also lessons in how to live & work at making music without being destroyed by the Music Business.\"\n\nCocker continued: \"He was a unique individual. My thoughts are with those close to him. Listen to the music he was involved in & read what he wrote about it. It's worth it.\"\n\nCocker and Albini had met in 2008 at the Pitchfork Music Festival, and soon began discussing ideas together. In January the following year, Cocker began recording 'Further Complications' at Albini's studio, and the album was released in May 2009.\n\nBesides Cocker's 'Further Complications', Albini was known for recording and producing major albums such as Nirvana's 'In Utero', Pixies' 'Surfer Rosa', PJ Harvey's 'Rid of Me', Manic Street Preachers' 'Journal For Plague Lovers' and more.\n\nAs a musician, Albini fronted the likes of underground bands such as Shellac, Big Black and Flour. Shellac recently announced 'To All Trains', their first album in 10 years which is set for release next week (May 17) and were preparing to embark on a tour.\n\nSteve Albini performs with Shellac in 2022. Credit: Jim Bennett/WireImage\n\nFollowing the news of Albini's death, Pixies, Benefits and more have paid tribute to the late producer - you can read them here.\n\nMost recently, Nirvana's social media accounts have shared the four-paged letter Albini had sent them, proposing that he wanted to produce 'In Utero', and outlined his approach to recording music.\n\nSpeaking to NME last year, Albini shared that being forever associated with Nirvana due to his work on their 1993 final album 'In Utero' was no albatross. \"It's totally normal, it's perfectly reasonable,\" the producer and audio engineer told NME. \"If you had never heard of me before and someone is trying to introduce me to you, they are going to name the famous records that I worked on - and 'In Utero' is the most famous.\"\n\nLast year, Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic spoke to NME and recalled working with the producer and how the band landed on the post-'Nevermind' sound of the record. \"Kurt was a fan of Albini,\" he said. \"I remember being in a tour van in 1989 and Kurt was listening to Pixies. He raised his finger and said, 'This shall be our snare sound!' He wanted to do it with Steve for a long time.\"", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "surej_singh@nme.com", "name": "Surej Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarvis_Cocker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jarvis Cocker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pixies (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_Audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electrical Audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shellac (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recording studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitchfork_Music_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitchfork Music Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Street_Preachers", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manic Street Preachers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ_Harvey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PJ Harvey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sound recording and reproduction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Black", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Underground music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snare_drum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snare drum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NME", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NME"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krist_Novoselic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Krist Novoselic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bass guitar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home_Recording", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home Recording", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jarvis-cocker-steve-albini@2000x1270.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 16}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 1929, "textEnd": 1935}, {"amb": false, "date": "2009-01-", "textStart": 765, "textEnd": 777}, {"amb": false, "date": "2009-05-", "textStart": 1468, "textEnd": 1476}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Maybe in the next few days, we could talk about his impact, which was immense,\" Fox said in an email.\n\nAlbini's death came little more than a week before his longtime band Shellac was set to release a new album, To All Trains, on May 17. It will be the band's first album since 2014.\n\nAlbini was both revered and influential in the world of indie rock. He elevated the genre in its heyday of the 80s and 90s to a standard that still resonates today.\n\nFirst developing an interest in punk after being introduced to the Ramones as a teen, Albini voraciously consumed all the new music he could find growing up in his hometown of Missoula, Montana, and played in his earliest music projects. After graduating high school, he moved to Evanston, Illinois, to attend journalism school at Northwestern University, immersing himself in the scene as a fan and a writer for local music magazines.\n\nAlbini began his music career in 1981 when he formed the punk rock band Big Black while a student at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University.\n\nHe later went on to form two other bands, the controversially named Rapeman and Shellac, with the latter the longest-existing and arguably the most important band of his career as a performer. For Shellac, he performed vocals and guitar alongside bassist Bob Weston and drummer Todd Trainer.\n\nHe also helped record and track some of the most influential albums of the alternative rock era in the 1980s and 1990s, including Nirvana's \"In Utero,\" Pixies' \"Surfer Rosa,\" PJ Harvey's \"Rid of Me,\" Veruca Salt's EP \"Blow It Out Your A** It's Veruca Salt,\" and multiple albums for Urge Overkill and The Jesus Lizard.\n\nHe also helped record music for legends such as Cheap Trick, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, and Foo Fighters, who recorded their hit song \"Something from Nothing\" at his Electrical Audio studio in Chicago.\n\nIn a Chicago Magazine profile published 30 years ago this month, writer Mark Jannot described Albini as \"the music industry's avatar of opposition, its icon of iconoclasm.\" The profile documented Albini's quest for perfection in the recording studio as he sought to make recordings that emulated a band's live sound as faithfully as possible - as well as the unabashed \"streams of bile\" he directed toward not only the record industry, but bands of which he disapproved.\n\nOn his meticulousness in the studio, Albini was quoted: \"I honestly just feel that music like this deserves to be taken seriously. And that means people who record them should be as concerned about quality as if they were recording the f***ing Chicago Symphony.\"\n\n\"I think his approach to recording artists was really influential - you know - and it was, 'I want to capture the band the way they sound in the room, as if you were sitting five feet in front of them and having your hair blown back by the power,\" music critic Jim DeRogatis said Wednesday.\n\nThe 1994 Chicago Magazine profile also referenced a famous screed that Albini wrote directed at rock critic Bill Wyman of the Chicago Reader - not to be confused with the former bassist from The Rolling Stones. Wyman had sung the praises of three Chicago area acts that had made it big - the Smashing Pumpkins, Liz Phair, and Urge Overkill - in a 1993 year-in-review column, for what he called \"an explicit rejection of much of the insularity that increasingly characterizes underground music and the fringes of alternative music in America.\"\n\nAlbini fired back in a letter to the paper and dismissed all three acts as generic and mainstream - calling Phair \"a persona completely unrooted in substance, and a f***ing chore to listen to,\" and comparing the Smashing Pumpkins to REO Speedwagon while calling them \"ultimately insignificant.\"\n\nHe also wrote, directed at Wyman: \"Music press stooges like you tend to believe and repeat what other music press stooges write, reinforcing each other's misconceptions as though the tiny little world you guys live in (imagine a world so small!) actually means something to us on the outside.\" In Jannot's article, Wyman was quoted that his comment about \"insularity\" in underground music, had, in fact, been a jab at Albini and what he perceived as Albini's elitism.\n\nJust last year, Albini was the subject of another profile by Jeremy Gordon in The Guardian. Gordon wrote that while Albini may have come across as an unpleasant person, he was at the end of the day someone who \"defended punk's credos - don't sign to major labels, reject authority, say what's on your mind, make a lot of noise - with uncompromising passion at a time when the counterculture was increasingly being assimilated, marketed and sold by the powers that be.\"\n\nJannot's story included a quote from Albini, \"In a lot of ways, you spend the last 50 years of your life trying to get over the first 12.\"\n\nThe grief from Albini's passing was felt across the music industry.\n\nThe news quickly spread to friends and fans, who gathered outside his Electrical Audio studio in the Avondale neighborhood Wednesday.\n\nhis impact was significant with fellow musician Alison Chesley who opened for his Big Black in the 90s.\n\n\"He changed my life as a musician and as a person, and he was a good person,\" said Chesley. \"He had a kind of a prickly reputation, but he was the sweetest, most loving person.\"\n\nJoe Shanahan, the owner of Metro Chicago in Wrigleyville, took to his marquee to honor Albini on Tuesday. Albini played at the Metro countless times with his band.\n\nShanahan also couldn't deny that Albini had a sharp tongue.\n\n\"He was brutally honest. We'll say that there,\" Shanahan said. \"He did not hold back.\"\n\nBut by all accounts, Albini was more than a caustic curmudgeon. DeRogatis also emphasized how Albini stuck strictly to the underground ethical aesthetic in the recording studio, by keeping the focus on the musicians he was recording and capturing their sound - not centering himself.\n\n\"He wore these industrial overalls in his studio on Belmont just off Western, and he said, 'You hire a plumber, and they come and they fix your toilet.' You hire me, and I capture what you do. I don't put my thumbprint on it. I don't take royalties from the recording,'\" said DeRogatis, \"which set him apart from 90% of big-name producers.\"\n\nBut this also meant the musicians didn't get any indulgence they desired either, DeRogatis said.\n\n\"Many big-name bands tried to hire him, and he worked with a few. He worked with Robert Plant and Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin,\" he said. \"But they had to work his way, which is: 'We're not going to do a million overdubs. We're not going to have caviar catered to the studio. I'm going to wear my overalls. I'm going to mic things the way I think they should. I am not going to give you my opinion unless you ask for it. This was a very Chicago attitude.\"\n\nShanahan said Albini's legacy will significantly lean on his impact in Chicago.\n\n\"The indie and punk rock scene of Chicago has his fingerprints all over it,\" Shanahan said. \"Steve was a mechanic. You know, he was a worker - a blue-collar sort of like ethic.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It was a controversial innovation at the time, from a man whose career would be defined by risky choices. The band's best-known song, the ugly, explosive, six-minute \"Kerosene\" from their cult favorite album, 1986's \"Atomizer,\" is ideal evidence -- and not for the faint of heart.\n\nThen came the short lived band Rapeman -- one of two groups Albini fronted with indefensibly offensive names and vulgar song titles. In the early '90s, he formed Shellac, the ferocious, distorted noise-rock band -- an evolution from Big Black, but still punctuated by pummeling guitar tones and aggressive vocals.\n\nIn 1997, Albini opened his famed studio, Electrical Audio, in Chicago.\n\n\"The recording part is the part that matters to me -- that I'm making a document that records a piece of our culture, the life's work of the musicians that are hiring me,\" Albini told The Guardian last year, when asked about some of the well-known and much-loved albums he's recorded. \"I take that part very seriously. I want the music to outlive all of us.\"\n\nAlbini was a larger-than-life character in the independent rock music scene, known for his forward-thinking productions, unapologetic irreverence, acerbic sense of humor and criticisms of the music industry's exploitative practices -- as detailed in his landmark 1993 essay \"The Problem with Music\" -- as much as his talents.\n\nLater in life, he became a notable poker player and apologetic for his past indiscretions.\n\n\"Ugh man, a heartbreaking loss of a legend. Love to his family and innumerable colleagues,\" wrote actor Elijah Woodon X. \"Farewell, Steve Albini.\"\n\nAuthor Michael Azerrad, who included a chapter on Big Black in his comprehensive history, \"Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981-1991,\" also posted on X. \"I don't know what to say about Steve Albini's passing,\" Azerrad wrote. \"He had a brilliant mind, was a great artist and underwent the most remarkable and inspiring personal transformation. I can't believe he's gone.\"\n\nAlbini is survived by his wife, Heather Whinna, a filmmaker.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He's still mad about 'Firefly' getting canceled.\n\nSteve Albini, the iconoclastic rock musician and audio engineer who helped define the sound of iconic bands like Nirvana and Pixies in the 1990s, has died of a heart attack, staff at his Electrical Audio studio confirmed to Entertainment Weekly. He was 61.\n\nBorn on July 22, 1962, in Pasadena, Calif., Albini first started playing bass guitar while recovering from a broken leg as a teenager. While studying at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, he became involved in the punk-rock scene in nearby Chicago and started his first group, Big Black, who were profiled in Our Band Could Be Your Life, journalist Michael Azerrad's seminal history of 1980s underground rock. Albini had two other bands, Rapeman and Shellac, the latter of which is set to release For All the Trains, their first album in a decade, later this month.\n\nIn addition to making his own music, Albini was best known as a recording engineer for other bands. He preferred the term \"engineer\" to \"producer\" because the latter is not necessarily associated with actual technical expertise. Albini founded his personal recording studio, Electrical Audio, in 1995.\n\nHis personal philosophy about engineering was not to impose his own aesthetic on bands but, rather, bring out their unique sound as much as possible.\n\nSome of the most notable acts Albini worked with include Nirvana, Pixies, the Breeders, PJ Harvey, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and Jimmy Page and Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin, among many others.\n\nHis work on Nirvana's third and final album, In Utero, helped distinguish it from their 1991 breakthrough LP, Nevermind, though Albini said in 2021 that it made him \"persona non grata\" with major record labels for years afterward.\n\nHowever, the backlash was mostly fine for him, since Albini was an outspoken critic of the corporate music industry. In his 1993 essay \"The Problem with Music,\" he laid out the many obstacles facing young bands, from slimy agents to hack producers who repeat the same old pablum. Albini was never afraid to share his opinion on popular and underground culture; his commentary ranged from jokes to serious takes, like a 2021 Twitter thread in which he reckoned with his generation's use of \"edgy\" humor.\n\n\"He had a brilliant mind, was a great artist, and underwent the most remarkable and inspiring personal transformation,\" Azerrad wrote on Twitter following Albini's death.\n\n\"Steve touched countless lives and changed mine and many others for the better. A genuine, singular, principled person,\" wrote Dylan Baldi of Cloud Nothings, whose 2012 album, Attack on Memory, Albini engineered. \"Spent the last 40 years helping people make art. There's no reason for him to be gone, and the world is less interesting without him.

He was 61.\n\nHis death from a heart attack was confirmed by Taylor Hales of Electrical Audio, the Chicago studio Albini founded in the mid-'90s\n\nAlbini, who was also a musician in punk rock bands Big Black and Shellac, was a noted critic of the industry in which he worked, often offering withering commentary about the artists who hired him.\n\nHe referred to Nirvana as \"an unremarkable version of the Seattle sound,\" but accepted the job to produce the band's 1993 album, \"In Utero.\" Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain said at the time that he liked Albini's technique of capturing the natural sound in a recording room for an element of rawness. In a circulated letter Albini wrote to the band before signing on, he concurs that he wants to \"bang out a record in a couple of days.\"\n\nMore: Beatles movie 'Let It Be' is more than a shorter 'Get Back': 'They were different animals'\n\nAlbini also famously refused to accept royalties from any of the records he produced. As he wrote in the Nirvana letter, \"paying a royalty to a producer or engineer is ethically indefensible\" and asked \"to be paid like a plumber: I do the job and you tell me what it's worth.\"\n\nOther albums featuring Albini as recording engineer include the Pixies' \"Surfer Rosa,\" The Stooges' \"The Weirdness,\" Robbie Fulks' \"Country Love Songs\" and Plant and Page's \"Walking Into Clarksdale.\"\n\nAlbini was an unabashed student of analog recording, dismissing digital in harsh terms and hated the term \"producer,\" instead preferring \"recording engineer.\"\n\nA native of Pasadena, California, Albini moved with his family to Montana as a teenager and engulfed himself in the music of the Ramones and The Sex Pistols as a precursor to playing in area punk bands. He earned a journalism degree at Northwestern University and started his recording career in 1981.\n\nIn his 1993 essay, \"The Problem with Music,\" Albini, who wrote stories for local Chicago music magazines in the '80s, spotlighted the underbelly of the business, from \"The A&R person is the first to promise them the moon\" to succinct breakdowns of how much an artist actually receives from a record advance minus fees for everything from studio fees, recording equipment and catering.\n\nAlbini, who was readying the release of the first Shellac record in a decade, also participated in high-stakes poker tournaments with significant success. In 2018, he won a World Series of Poker gold bracelet and a pot of $105,000, and in 2022 repeated his feat in a H.O.R.S.E. competition for $196,000 prize.

He was 61.\n\nAlbini fronted the underground rock bands Big Black and Shellac, but was perhaps best known for his production and engineering work on classic albums including Nirvana's In Utero, Pixies' Surfer Rosa and PJ Harvey's Rid of Me.\n\nHis death from a heart attack has been confirmed by staff at Electrical Audio, the Chicago recording studio he founded in 1997, reports Pitchfork.\n\nAlbini was born in Pasadena, California in 1962 before his family moved to the college town of Missoula, Montana in 1974.\n\nAs a teenager he started playing bass guitar while recovering from a broken leg, and developed a deep fascination with punk music after being introduced to the first Ramones album.\n\nHe received a degree in journalism from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, and put it to use writing for punk rock zines in and around Chicago.\n\nIn 1981, Albini formed the heavy punk rock band Big Black, singing and playing guitar along with guitarist Santiago Durango and bassist Jeff Pezzati. They released their debut album Atomizer in 1986 and influential follow-up Songs About F***ing the following year.\n\nFrom the mid-1980s, Albini began working as a record producer although he disliked the term and preferred to either receive no credit or be referred to as a \"recording engineer\".\n\nThe raw, unfiltered sound that Albini captured on the 1988 Pixies album Surfer Rosa and the Breeders' Pod in 1990 brought him to the attention of Kurt Cobain, who sought him out to work on Nirvana's third and final studio album In Utero in 1993.\n\nHe was incredibly industrious as an engineer, estimating in 2018 that he had worked on thousands of records by the likes of Mogwai, Jimmy Page & Robert Plant and Joanna Newsom.\n\nIn 1992, Albini formed Shellac, a noise rock band who released five albums between 1994 and 2014. Their sixth album To All Trains, their first in a decade, is set to be released next week.\n\nAs well as his prodigious output, Albini was also known for his outspoken opposition to the corporate music industry.\n\nIn 2015, the electronic producer Powell put up a massive billboard in Shoreditch, East London which displayed an email from Albini expressing his hatred for dance music.\n\nPowell, whose full name is Oscar Powell, had approached Albini about sampling Big Black for his single \"Insomniac\".\n\nSounds like you've got a cool thing set up for yourself. I am absolutely the wrong audience for this kind of music. I've always detested mechanised dance music, its stupid simplicity, the clubs where it was played, the people who went to those clubs, the drugs they took, the s**t they liked to talk about, the clothes they wore, the battles they fought amongst each other...\n\nBasically all of it: 100 percent hated every scrap.\n\nThe electronic music I liked was radical and different, s**t like the White Noise, Xenakis, Suicide, Kraftwerk, and the earliest stuff form Cabaret Voltaire, SPK and DAF. When that scene and those people got co-opted by dance/club music I felt like we'd lost a war. I detest club culture as deeply as I detest anything on earth. So I am against what you're into, and an enemy of where you come from but I have no problem with what you're doing...", "source": {"uri": "au.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!7

He was 61.\n\nThe cause was a heart attack, said Taylor Hales of Electrical Audio, the Chicago studio that Albini founded in 1997.\n\nWith a sharp vision for how a band should be recorded -- as raw as possible -- and an even sharper tongue for anything he deemed mediocre or compromised, Albini was a visionary in the studio and one of rock's most acerbic wits.\n\nOn his own, he led the bands Big Black and Shellac, both of which venerated loud, abrasive guitars and snarling vocals. In those groups, and in virtually every project he worked on, Albini clung to punk's defiant do-it-yourself ethic with an almost religious tenacity.\n\nHe also long maintained an impish zeal to provoke and offend. Big Black's last, most acclaimed album, from 1987, has a typically unprintable title, and he once dismissed Nirvana -- the group that later hired him to record the album \"In Utero\" (1993), at the peak of their fame -- as nothing but \"R.E.M. with a fuzzbox.\"\n\nA withering and prolific critic of the music business's exploitive extremes, Albini wrote a widely quoted 1993 article, \"The Problem with Music,\" describing in clinical detail how naive bands are lured into major-label deals that, in most cases, leave them broke and in debt.\n\nIn that article, which was published in The Baffler, Albini laid out a hypothetical ledger for a rock group that had signed a US$250,000 record deal, but whose work, according to his math, netted the label $710,000 and the producer $90,000 -- and just $4,031.25 for each member.\n\n\"The band members have each earned about 1/3 as much as they would working at a 7-Eleven,\" Albini wrote, \"but they got to ride in a tour bus for a month.\"\n\nHowever, in the 1990s, when his work as a recording engineer -- he scoffed at being called a producer, thinking that term implied control over an artist's work -- was in highest demand, Albini made no apology for accepting big checks for recording major-label acts.\n\nHis recording approach, for underground bands like the Jesus Lizard and Slint, captured their muscular power with clarity, and brought out a drum sound you could feel in your gut.\n\nThose bands also worked with Albini at their own risk; in those days, he was known for ridiculing the bands he recorded after the fact.\n\n\"Never have I seen four cows more anxious to be led around by their nose rings,\" he wrote after recording \"Surfer Rosa,\" the seminal 1988 album by the Boston-based quartet Pixies, which became one of the defining classics of 1980s alt-rock. (Even so, Albini remained a close friend of Kim Deal, the bassist in that band, and recorded her other project, the Breeders.)\n\nBut to those who followed Albini closely, he was far more than a two-dimensional character. He became a champion poker player -- winning more than $196,000 at the World Series of Poker in 2022 -- and embraced social media, answering questions at great length and often with eye-opening honesty.\n\nIn recent years he also surprised many of his followers and detractors alike by revisiting his often-obnoxious past persona with a sense of contrition.\n\n\"A lot of things I said and did from an ignorant position of comfort and privilege are clearly awful and I regret them,\" he wrote on Twitter, the platform now called X, in 2021.\n\nSteve Albini was born in Pasadena, California, on July 22, 1962, and grew up in Missoula, Montana, where his father, Frank, worked as a wildfire research scientist.\n\nHe has described his young life in Montana as unremarkable until, as a teenager, he heard the Ramones' first album, a blueprint of punk rock that was released in 1976. Its aggression, simplicity and puerile sense of humour opened up a new world for him.\n\n\"It was the first time I felt like there was any part of culture that represented the irreverence and goofiness and kind of mania that my friends and I were displaying,\" Albini told The Guardian in an interview last year.\n\nHe enrolled at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, near Chicago, and began to develop his approach as a provocateur and a self-reliant musician. As an art project, he once stood behind a pane of plexiglass and taunted the audience to throw whatever they wanted at the barrier.\n\nWhile at Northwestern, he recorded the first Big Black EP, \"Lungs\" (1982), almost entirely by himself on a borrowed reel-to-reel tape machine. It had cold, echoey, synthetic rhythms, and it sketched out a dark, nihilistic worldview in its opening lines: \"The only good policeman is a dead one/ The only good laws aren't enforced.\"\n\nBig Black soon became a full band -- though it continued to use drum machines -- and the group's output came to define a particularly raw form of the post-punk vanguard. At its best, on songs like \"Kerosene\" and \"Jordan, Minnesota,\" the band presented a nightmarish view of America, populated by arsonists, killers and child abusers, set to an impossibly intense, screeching soundtrack.\n\nAt the same time, Albini made a name for himself as a splenetic commentator on music. His written work, published in various fanzines, could seem like a form of insult comedy. He dismissed the Replacements' beloved 1984 album, \"Let It Be,\" for example, as \"a sad, pathetic end to a long downhill slide.\"\n\nIn the late 1980s, he reached perhaps the height of his provocation with a new band he called Rapeman; the name, he said, was borrowed from a Japanese comic book, though he never denied it was meant to goad the audience. At some shows, the band faced protests. \"The really annoying thing,\" he once said, \"was that the majority of the people on the picket line were precisely the kind of people that we would have liked at the gig.\"\n\nAfter making \"Surfer Rosa,\" which brought Pixies to wide attention, Albini became an in-demand producer for underground acts like Boss Hog, Superchunk and Urge Overkill. He recorded PJ Harvey's \"Rid of Me\" (1993) with serrated guitars and -- unorthodox for a major album -- vocals set notably low in the mix.\n\nHe was soon courted by Nirvana for its follow-up to \"Nevermind,\" the album that became a global smash and ignited a revolution in the music business. Before agreeing to work with the group, he sent its three members a letter giving advice and laying out his terms.\n\n\"Bang out a record in a couple of days, with high quality but minimal 'production,'\" he wrote, \"and no interference from the front office bulletheads.\" He also told them, \"I would like to be paid like a plumber\" -- meaning that he wanted a flat fee and not \"points,\" or a percentage of sales, a common practice among top record producers that Albini disdained as unethical.\n\nBut when the album was completed, the band's record label, DGC, pushed for changes, and several of its tracks were remixed by Scott Litt, who had worked with R.E.M. \"They waged a publicity campaign to try to shame the band into doing the record again,\" Albini once told Tape Op, a magazine about audio recording.\n\nHe said his reputation had been damaged by the incident, though it was resuscitated when Jimmy Page and Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin recruited him for their 1998 album, \"Walking into Clarksdale.\"\n\nSince then, he had continued to work as an engineer and producer for countless bands, often at Electrical Audio, his studio; in a 2018 interview, he estimated that he had recorded \"probably a couple thousand\" albums to that point. Among the most acclaimed of them are records by Joanna Newsom, Nina Nastasia, Neurosis and Will Oldham.\n\nHis survivors include his wife, filmmaker Heather Whinna, and his mother, Gina. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.\n\nWhen asked by The Guardian last year how he would like his career to be seen if he were to retire then, Albini answered: \"I'm doing it, and that's what matters to me -- the fact that I get to keep doing it. That is the whole basis of it. I was doing it yesterday, and I'm gonna do it tomorrow, and I'm gonna carry on doing it.\"", "source": {"uri": "bangkokpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangkok Post"}, "authors": [],

He was 61.\n\nA representative for Electrical Audio, Albini's Chicago recording studio, confirmed Albini's death following a heart attack on Tuesday. The representative did not have available a further statement or a list of survivors.\n\nAlbini was a giant of punk and experimental rock music from the '80s to the present day. He produced (or as he preferred to call his job, \"engineered\") Nirvana's final studio album, \"In Utero,\" selected by the band for his raw, uncompromising aesthetic. Albums like the Pixies' \"Surfer Rosa\" and PJ Harvey's \"Rid of Me\" felt bracing and dangerous then, and continue to inspire young rockers today for their seething energy and defiance of pop audio convention.\n\n\"I've gotten exactly one phone call out of a No. 1 record,\" Albini told The Times in 1993. \"It shows how pack-like these major-label people are. They all think the same thing: 'That Albini guy is trouble. Stay away.'\"\n\nAlbini, raised in Missoula, Mont., was the son of a rocket scientist father and inherited his engineer's meticulousness. The young Albini, smart and disenchanted with the local conservative culture, discovered punk through music magazines and found safe harbor for misfits. After moving to Chicago to attend Northwestern University for journalism, he rose to scene prominence as an artist in the scabrous groups Big Black and Shellac, which emerged from the fertile post-hardcore underground alongside bands like Sonic Youth, Butthole Surfers and the Minutemen.\n\nSnarling and sneering through big hornrim glasses, yet just as ambitious and uncorruptable as he was abrasive, Albini became a star in the underground. \"How many boys want to be whipped by Steve Albini's guitar?\" Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon told the Village Voice in 1988.\n\n\"Big Black introduced one of the indie world's foremost characters,\" wrote Michael Azerrad in the definitive indie-punk scene biography, \"Our Band Could Be Your Life.\" \"A person who would define not just the sound of underground music through the next two decades, but also its discourse -- the irascible, outspoken, intelligent and relentlessly ethical Steve Albini.\"\n\nShellac in particular was a formative influence for countless punk, metal, electronic and noise bands. The group's 1994 LP \"At Action Park\" was a brutal read on post-punk, its minimalist yet seething power-trio instrumentation slinking with menace.\n\nAlbini paired his dedication to the most vicious, arresting sounds possible with a workmanlike professionalism as a producer in his studio, Electrical Audio. He was famous for wearing a mechanic-style jumpsuit to sessions, an overt gesture at how he saw his role.\n\n\"I've always had a fairly standard method,\" he said of his recording techniques. \"I have a straightforward, documentary approach to recording music, and I've never been tempted with my own bands or with anyone else's band to suddenly go production-happy. If you let the band sound natural, then the record will sink or swim on its own merits. ... The things I like most about rock bands are simplicity and straightforwardness, and those principles guide my recordings.\"\"\n\nHe was a ferocious advocate for artists. A famous essay in the Baffler, \"The Problem With Music,\" laid out the perfidies of the major-label system, at the time still in a post-Nirvana feeding frenzy for young rock acts.\n\n\"Whenever I talk to a band who are about to sign with a major label, I always end up thinking of them in a particular context,\" Albini wrote. \"I imagine a trench, about four feet wide and five feet deep, maybe sixty yards long, filled with runny, decaying s -- . I imagine these people, some of them good friends, some of them barely acquaintances, at one end of this trench. I also imagine a faceless industry lackey at the other end, holding a fountain pen and a contract waiting to be signed.\"\n\n\"In Utero,\" Nirvana's followup to the the epochal \"Nevermind,\" bridged the gap between the underground music Kurt Cobain loved and the expectations placed on the biggest band in the world. \"Feeling uncomfortable with this new world of Nirvana fame,\" drummer Dave Grohl said in an interview last year. \"When things did become huge, we all sort of clung to the things we felt most attached to. We had always listened to records Steve had made.\"\n\nAlbini's catalog spans decades of fierce and fearless rock and experimental records, from Slint and Jesus Lizard to Low, Mogwai and Joanna Newsom. He wrote and recorded up to his death. Shellac was about to tour around its first album in a decade, \"To All Trains,\" which will be released next week.\n\n\"What matters to me is that I do things in a way that I feel is -- for lack of a better word -- righteous,\" Albini told The Times. \"Everything that I do, I do basically with the same goal: I want to make better, cheaper punk-rock records today than I did yesterday.\"", "source":

The band's best-known song, the ugly, explosive, six-minute \"Kerosene\" from their cult favorite album, 1986's \"Atomizer,\" is ideal evidence -- and not for the faint of heart.\n\nThen came the short lived band Rapeman -- one of two groups Albini fronted with indefensibly offensive names and vulgar song titles. In the early '90s, he formed Shellac, the ferocious, distorted noise-rock band -- an evolution from Big Black, but still punctuated by pummeling guitar tones and aggressive vocals.\n\nIn 1997, Albini opened his famed studio, Electrical Audio, in Chicago.\n\n\"The recording part is the part that matters to me -- that I'm making a document that records a piece of our culture, the life's work of the musicians that are hiring me,\" Albini told The Guardian last year, when asked about some of the well-known and much-loved albums he's recorded. \"I take that part very seriously. I want the music to outlive all of us.\"\n\nAlbini was a larger-than-life character in the independent rock music scene, known for his forward-thinking productions, unapologetic irreverence, acerbic sense of humor and criticisms of the music industry's exploitative practices -- as detailed in his landmark 1993 essay \"The Problem with Music\" -- as much as his talents.\n\nLater in life, he became a notable poker player and apologetic for his past indiscretions.\n\n\"Ugh man, a heartbreaking loss of a legend. Love to his family and innumerable colleagues,\" wrote actor Elijah Woodon X. \"Farewell, Steve Albini.\"\n\nAuthor Michael Azerrad, who included a chapter on Big Black in his comprehensive history, \"Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981-1991,\" also posted on X. \"I don't know what to say about Steve Albini's passing,\" Azerrad wrote. \"He had a brilliant mind, was a great artist and underwent the most remarkable and inspiring personal transformation. I can't believe he's gone.\"\n\nAlbini is survived by his wife, Heather Whinna, a filmmaker.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Whether engineering albums by Pixies and the Jesus Lizard or leading his own bands Shellac and Big Black, Albini specialized in capturing the visceral thrill of guitars and drums played at ear-splitting volumes. Separately, when writing for zines like Forced Exposure or in later years holding court on Twitter and Bluesky, Albini was both articulate and argumentative about his taste in bands, his recording techniques and his contempt for exploitive music industry customs.\n\nRaised in California and Montana, Albini migrated east to study journalism at Northwestern University and then stayed in Chicago for the rest of his life, founding the Electrical Audio studio and becoming both a major player in the city's exploding indie rock scene and its harshest critic. He reached a new level of fame when Kurt Cobain asked him to record Nirvana's 1993 album In Utero, and he subsequently worked on high-profile projects by Bush and Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, even as he remained outspoken about the commercialization of punk and alternative rock.\n\nAlbini always shunned \"producer\" as his job description, preferring to proudly bill himself as simply an engineer. He also refused \"points,\" or royalties, for albums on which he worked - in the case of In Utero, that decision admittedly cost him hundreds of thousands dollars.\n\nAlbini died of a heart attack at the age of 61 on May 7, leaving behind a handful of intense and purposeful albums as a bandleader and thousands of remarkably diverse projects as a producer and engineer. Here's a look back at 10 of the best:\n\nIf Albini was pigeonholed in the '90s as a crank with a narrow idea of good music, he regularly subverted that image in the 21 century, working with everyone from Cheap Trick and Umphrey's McGee to Sunn O))) and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker never would've seemed like an ideal foil for Albini when he was one of the kings of Britpop in the mid-'90s, but after they hit it off at the 2008 Pitchfork Music Festival, Albini recorded Cocker's second solo album. The dry wit and lecherous sleaze of Cocker's lyrics works surprisingly well over more abrasive backing, and Further Complications is the best album he's made since This Is Hardcore.\n\n9. Shellac - 1000 Hurts (2000)\n\nBy far Albini's longest-running band, Shellac formed in 1992 and was planning a May 17 release for its first album in a decade, To All Trains. Of the back catalog, 1000 Hurts is probably Shellac's funniest album as well as their best. \"This is a sad fuckin' song / We'll be lucky if I don't bust out cryin',\" Albini deadpans at the opening of \"Squirrel Song,\" an absurd narrative about a survivalist going off the grid with rodent-powered electricity. Veteran character actor Philip Baker Hall also delivers the album's spoken intro for some reason. Throughout, Albini's fellow Electrical Audio engineer Bob Weston unfurls monstrous basslines and drummer Todd Trainer expertly expands and contracts the tempo, particularly on \"New Number Order.\"\n\n8. The Breeders - Pod (1990)\n\nKim Deal of the Pixies and Tanya Donnelly of Throwing Muses were regularly clubbing together in the late '80s when they decided to start a \"dance band\" together to cover such artists as Chaka Khan. It's hard to hear those origins on the first Breeders album (the only to feature Donnelly before she left to form the band Belly), but when Slint drummer Britt Walford's snare punches through the speakers on \"Lime House,\" It's also easy to hear why Pod was the album that inspired Kurt Cobain to hire Albini for In Utero. Pod isn't wall-to-wall hooks like the band's platinum follow-up Last Splash, but it's Deal's boldest and most original set of songs.\n\n7. Slint - Tweez (1989)\n\nNot only did Albini dislike being credited as a producer, he didn't even allow his name to appear in the liner notes for some of the best albums he recorded. Superchunk's No Pocky For Kitty didn't credit Albini (at his own suggestion), while he was listed as 'Some Fuckin Derd Niffer' on Slint's 1989 debut LP, Tweez, released by micro indie Jennifer Hartman Records and largely unnoticed for some time afterwards. Indeed, the groundbreaking Louisville underground rock band became a cult sensation after their 1991 album Spiderland and subsequent breakup, prompting Touch & Go to reissue Tweez in 1993. The EP's cryptic tangle of unorthodox time signatures and sudden volume shifts long predated the American \"post rock\" boom, while also introducing the talents of Walford, vocalist Brian McMahan and guitarist David Pajo to like-minded weirdos the world over.\n\n6. Low - Things We Lost in the Fire (2001)\n\nWorking on two of Low's finest albums, 1999's Secret Name and the 2001 masterpiece Things We Lost in the Fire, is probably the biggest reason Albini stopped being stereotyped as a guy who only made loud and fast records. The duo of Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker had long cultivated a hushed sound featuring crawling tempos, and Albini showcased their harmonies in loving detail on \"Whore\" and \"July.\" \"Mimi Parker had a beautifully pure voice, but what made Low special was the way her voice and Alan's meshed, creating a single tone,\" Albini told The Guardian after Parker's death in 2022.\n\n5. The Jesus Lizard - Goat (1991)\n\nIf Albini had any true musical soulmates among the many many bands he recorded, they were the members of the Jesus Lizard, who formed in Austin and soon after relocated to Chicago. Albini worked on all of the band's first four albums, which stand together as a monument of pounding, scraping riffage. Most noise bands are proudly lo-fi by necessity or by choice, but the Jesus Lizard's albums with Albini made the argument that David Yow's scream and Mac McNeilly's kick drum deserved to be captured in crystal clear detail, like the individual gears of a giant machine.\n\n4. Big Black - Songs About Fucking (1987)\n\nIn later years when he became more active on social media, Albini was thoughtful and sometimes apologetic about the gory, violent words and imagery found in much of his early music and writing, particularly the name of his short-lived band Rapeman. Big Black's second album, however, is the peak of Albini's edgelord provocateur era, a record where the closest thing to a romantic lyric is \"Holding my hand while I piss in her face.\" The album featured a cover of Kraftwerk's \"The Model\" to acknowledge the debt Big Black's drum machine-assisted assault owed to the earlier, milder pioneers of machine music.\n\n3. PJ Harvey - Rid of Me (1993)\n\nPJ Harvey was a band fronted by Polly Jean Harvey for two albums, before the singer/songwriter disbanded the group while retaining the name as an umbrella for an adventurous solo career. On Rid of Me, Albini captured the defining document of Harvey's thunderous power trio era with bassist Steve Vaughn and drummer Rob Ellis, from the punk blues of \"Ecstasy\" to the percussive clank of \"Legs.\" Harvey praised Albini on MTV's 120 Minutes for his thorough use of room mics to capture a live sound, telling host Lewis Largent, \"He's the only person that can record a drum kit and it sounds like you're standing in front of a drum kit.\"\n\n2. Nirvana - In Utero (1993)\n\nKurt Cobain knew Nirvana's follow-up to Nevermind would probably sell millions no matter what it sounded like, so he threw caution to the wind and scared the hell out of Geffen Records by hiring Albini to record it. Albini, who'd been unhappy with a contemporaneous experience when Andy Wallace mixed a Helmet song he'd engineered, was wary of the high-pressure situation and fiercely protective of the raw sound of In Utero, at one point withholding the master tapes from Nirvana's management. Even with Scott Litt remixing the singles \"Heart Shaped Box\" and \"All Apologies,\" Cobain and company's final studio album was a cultural reset for mainstream rock. Specifically, the thudding grooves of \"Scentless Apprentice\" and the chaotic guitars of the sarcastically titled \"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\" traced a direct line back to Albini's heaviest work with Touch & Go Records bands such as Tar and the Jesus Lizard.\n\n1. Pixies - Surfer Rosa (1988)\n\nAlbini rarely spoke reverently, or even politely, about the more famous bands with whom he worked. Three years after recording Pixies' landmark debut album, for instance, he dismissed them as a \"blandly entertaining college rock\" band who were \"guided by their manager, their record company and their producers\" (he expressed regret over those comments in 2005). Whether or not Albini appreciated what he accomplished on Surfer Rosa, thankfully, we all can. From applying studio bathroom reverb to Kim Deal's backing vocal on the iconic Fight Club soundtrack staple \"Where Is My Mind?\" to running Black Francis' voice through a guitar amp on \"Something Against You,\" Surfer Rosa expertly incorporates these inventive recording techniques to help turn an eccentric band from Boston into the standard bearer for a new generation of alternative rock.", "source": {"uri": "spin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spin"}, "authors": [{"uri": "al_shipley@spin.com", "name": "Al Shipley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shellac (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pixies (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_Audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electrical Audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_Lizard", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Jesus Lizard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Black", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Big Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurts", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hurts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slint", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deadpan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indie rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Cobain", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Cobain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalty_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royalty payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_Exposure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forced Exposure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitchfork_Music_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitchfork Music Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_and_Plant", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Page and Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godspeed_You!_Black_Emperor", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Godspeed You!

Black Emperor, Mogwai, the Jesus Lizard, PJ Harvey, Joanna Newsom, Superchunk, Low, Jawbreaker, Neurosis, Cloud Nothings, Bush, The Stooges, Jarvis Cocker, Cheap Trick, Slint, Veruca Salt and even Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, among many more.\n\nA biography about Albini on his recording studio website says he was \"known for his naturalistic recording philosophy and meticulous analog working methods.\"\n\nAlbini was outspoken about the music industry, famously writing in 1993 for The Baffler that he believed major labels take advantage of young bands.\n\n\"Once a band has signed a letter of intent, they will either eventually sign a contract that suits the label or they will be destroyed,\" Albini wrote.\n\nAlbini also eschewed the title producer.\n\n\"Now, all that's required to be a full-fledged 'producer' is the gall it takes to claim to be one,\" Albini wrote. \"That's why few self-respecting engineers will allow themselves to be called 'producers.'\"\n\nHe favored the title recording engineer.\n\nRough Trade Records, which released several of the records on which he worked, wrote in a post on X that he \"always brought an intangible brilliance to the studio, as the records he made for us with Jarvis, Low and black midi attest.\"\n\nIn a 1993 interview with Tracking Angle, reupped by the publication following Albini's death, Albini expanded on his views about his job.\n\n\"Most recording engineers aren't fans of recorded music, first and foremost. They are fans of engineering first and foremost,\" he told the publication.\n\nHe added later: \"When I'm making a record with a band, the band is in charge. I am there as a technician, essentially, to make what they do every day as part of their normal life, to make that come across the speakers to someone listening at home.\"\n\nA gifted musician himself, Albini was also the front man of seminal noise rock band Shellac and punk rock outfit Big Black.\n\nShellac had recently announced a new album, the band's sixth studio LP, out May 17.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_boyette@cnn.com", "name": "Chris Boyette", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "justin_lear@cnn.com", "name": "Justin Lear", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indie rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_Audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electrical Audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recording studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pixies (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_Lizard", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Jesus Lizard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godspeed_You!_Black_Emperor", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Godspeed You!

The punk legend died at the age of 61 at his Chicago studio, Electrical Audio, following a heart attack.\n\nFamed for leading the punk and noise rock acts Shellac and Big Black, Albini was an instrumental force in the story of alternative rock and the fostering of its culture. Alongside his numerous musical exploits, he is best known for being the man who brought Nirvana's third and final album to life, 1994's In Utero.\n\nAs Nirvana were fans of the independent underground works he had produced, Kurt Cobain and the band enlisted Albini to help them get back to their roots. What ensued was undoubtedly the darkest effort in their oeuvre, featuring the tangible atmosphere of 'Heart-Shaped Box' and the raucous noise of 'Scentless Apprentice'. Despite the differences in the sound of the album and its Butch Vig-produced predecessor, Nevermind - the biggest album of the decade, Albini was clear in what he saw as he and Vig's similarities behind the mixing desk.\n\nOutside of Nirvana, it is estimated that Albini has worked on thousands of titles throughout his career. Preferring the term 'engineer' when describing his efforts, he famously brought Pixies' Surfer Rosa, PJ Harvey's Rid of Me, and The Jesus Lizard's Goat to life. These influential titles are just the tip of the iceberg of his exploits, too. Albini even recorded and mixed Walking into Clarksdale at London's storied Abbey Road Studios, the only album by surviving Led Zeppelin members Robert Plant and Jimmy Page.\n\nAs well as being an undisputable musical influence, Albini was a prominent critic of exploitative music industry practices. This viewpoint also bled into how he viewed collaborating with Nirvana. He said of working with them in 2023: \"Every other person they worked with was a manipulative piece of shit who was putting pressure on them, scapegoating me and shit-talking this great record they made.\"\n\nShellac were also entering a new period as of late. In March this year, they announced that To All Trains, their follow-up to 2014's Dude Incredible, will arrive on May 17th via Touch And Go. It was recorded at Electrical Audio over a series of weekends between 2017 and 2022.\n\nShellac confirmed in a statement at the time: \"The band will continue to play shows or tour at the same sporadic and relaxed pace as always. There is no correlation between shows and record releases.\" It remains to be seen how the release and their plans will pan out.\n\nIn a tribute posted to Albini on Twitter, The Lord of the Rings star Elijah Wood posted a picture of the late musician, writing: \"Ugh man, a heartbreaking loss of a legend. Love to his family and innumerable colleagues. Farewell, Steve Albini.\"\n\nBritish punk Frank Turner also wrote on Twitter: \"Wow. Medium gutted to hear about Steve Albini's passing. A punk legend.\"", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arun_starkey@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Arun Starkey", "type":

He was 61.\n\nThe cause was a heart attack, according to Taylor Hales of Electrical Audio, the studio in Chicago that Albini founded in 1997.\n\nWith a sharp vision for how a band should be recorded, and an even sharper tongue for anything he deemed mediocre or compromised, Albini was one of rock's most acerbic wits. He was also a withering critic of the exploitive extremes of the major-label music business, describing in a widely-quoted 1993 article, \"The Problem With Music,\" the ways that naive bands are lured into major deals with labels that, in most cases, leave them broke and in debt.\n\nIn the 1990s, when his work as a recording engineer -- he scoffed at being called a \"producer\" -- was in highest demand, however, Albini made no apology for accepting big checks for recording major-label bands. But those bands did so at their own risk; in those days Albini was also known for ridiculing the bands he recorded after the fact.\n\n\"Never have I seen four cows more anxious to be led around by their nose rings,\" he wrote after recording \"Surfer Rosa,\" the seminal 1988 album by the Boston-based band Pixies, which became one of the classics of 1980s alt-rock. (Even so, Albini remained a close friend of Kim Deal, the bassist in that band, and recorded her solo project, the Breeders.)\n\nAmong the albums he recorded was Nirvana's \"In Utero,\" at Pachyderm Recording Studios in Cannon Falls, Minn., in 1993.\n\nAs a musician, Albini led the bands Big Black in the 1980s and, since 1992, Shellac, both of which venerated loud, raw guitars and angry, screaming vocals. Neither came to wide commercial success but were widely influential, with Albini seen as a prophet of both aggressive rock and a defiant, do-it-yourself work ethic.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pixies (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ_Harvey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PJ Harvey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alternative rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_Audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrical Audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachyderm_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pachyderm Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shellac (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Black", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Deal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breeders", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Breeders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bassist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Do it yourself"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screaming_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Screaming (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon_Falls,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannon Falls, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cannon Falls, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1714769250", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

He succeeded.\n\nIf ever an underground icon swam with the music industry sharks and emerged with their integrity intact, it was Steve Albini. The acerbic Big Black and Shellac musician and studio engineer - he consistently denied the word 'producer' - whose death was confirmed yesterday (May 8) from a heart attack at his Chicago home, aged 61, was often a lone voice of anti-industry punk scene ethics, even as he worked with major labels on some of the biggest names in alternative rock.\n\nOver almost 40 years as alt-rock's most revered engineer, working on more than 2,000 albums, he shunned label interference and refused to exploit bands by taking royalty points on seminal albums such as Nirvana's 'In Utero', Pixies' 'Surfer Rosa', PJ Harvey's 'Rid Of Me' and The Breeders' 'Pod', thereby helping create a uniquely dry and visceral live sound that was at once raw and righteous. His opinion of the industry was made abundantly clear in his 1993 essay The Problem With Music, in which he described bands being offered a major label contract as swimming through \"a trench...filled with runny, decaying shit\" to sign it and broke down the financial realities of bands that make millions for industry and management figures ending up earning \"about 1/3 as much as they would working at a 7-11\".\n\nBorn in California in 1962 to a wildlife researcher father, Albini moved around with his family before settling in Missoula, Missouri. Here he learned to play bass while recovering from a broken leg and fell in love with the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, Devo and Pere Ubu. Moving to Chicago to study journalism, he became a divisive figure in the local punk scene thanks to his provocative zine writings, but also a pivotal one. His first major band Big Black, formed in 1981, packed their debut EP 'Lungs' with condoms and nosebleed tissues and sang songs of shocking violence, child abuse and misogyny, but made a coruscating noise on albums such as 'Atomizer' (1986) and 'Songs About Fucking' (1987) that invigorated the hardcore scene.\n\nHis next band, Rapeman - Albini would later express deep regret over his \"indefensible\" provocations from this era, akin to \"getting a bad tattoo\" - were short lived but the more refined abrasion of Shellac, formed in 1992 with Bob Weston and Todd Trainer, would become his primary musical outlet for the rest of his life, garnering acclaim for their five albums including 1994's 'At Acton Park'. A sixth Shellac album 'To All Trains' was due for release one week after Albini's unexpected death.\n\nIt was with Pixies' magnificently bare and aggressive 1988 album 'Surfer Rosa', though, that Albini made his name as an engineer. Recording was a ten-day blast of experiment, with Albini getting the band to play with metal picks, throw tennis balls at their guitars, record in the toilet and feed their vocals through guitars with, as Black Francis would say \"all the needles on red\". Albini would later describe the record as \"a patchwork pinch loaf from a band who at their top dollar best are blandly entertaining college rock\" (and even later retract the slight), but this definitive proto-grunge album saw him become so sought-after by alt-rock acts such as PJ Harvey, The Breeders, The Wedding Present (whose 'Seamonsters' is an outstanding Albini classic) and The Jesus Lizard that his studio work would come to define the rest of his career.\n\nIn looking to return to their grittier roots following the multi-platinum success of 'Nevermind', Nirvana turned to Albini to record 1993's savage 'In Utero', keen to emulate the Pixies and Breeders records which had influenced them. Albini obliged, penning a letter to the band laying out his process and ideology - that the label's \"front office bulletheads\" should have no involvement, the band's mood and opinions were paramount, Albini should be \"paid like a plumber\" and that \"if a record takes more than a week to make, somebody's fucking up\".\n\nObjecting to the exploitation of artists by labels throughout his life, these were tenets Albini stuck by through a long, prodigious and celebrated studio career. He'd reputedly work with anybody who called him, from local Chicago hardcore bands to the likes of Page And Plant, Manic Street Preachers and Mogwai, always taking a variable flat fee. His style proved infinitely adaptable, making the intimate textures of Joanna Newsom's 'Ys' (2006) or the dark dream pop of Low's 'Things We Lost In The Fire' (2001) every bit as engrossing as the alternative metal of Helmet.\n\nAn agnostic atheist, food blogger and poker player - he won two gold bracelets at various World Series Of Poker tournaments - Albini would often surprise bands wary of his prickly reputation with an open and accommodating nature in the studio, insisting that he was merely there to serve their creativity. But, inadvertently maybe, his inimitable sound and aesthetic became a fundamental bedrock of much of the greatest alternative music of the past forty years.

Albini had a heart attack, staff at his recording studio confirmed to Pitchfork on May 8. His death comes just as his band, Shellac, was preparing to release their first album in a decade, To All Trains, on May 17. Albini kick-started his career fronting the Illinois post-punk band Big Black, which he formed at Northwestern University. The band became influential in the burgeoning rock underground of the 1980s, especially for Albini's use of a drum machine in their music, a precursor to industrial rock. They released two albums, 1986's Atomizer and 1987's Songs About Fucking, before disbanding in 1987. Albini then formed the short-lived band Rapeman afterward (a name he since said he regrets). In 1992, he formed the trio Shellac, which steadily released albums during the '90s. Shellac last released the album Dude Incredible in 2014. The group recorded the upcoming To All Trains sporadically from 2017 to 2022.\n\nAlbini is even better known for his work in the studio, where he was alternative rock's most influential producer and engineer. (A critic of music-industry power structures, Albini notoriously disliked the term \"producer\" and shunned credit on albums he worked on, even forgoing royalties.) Albini recorded some of the albums that solidified alternative rock in the 1980s and '90s: Nirvana's In Utero, Pixies' Surfer Rosa, PJ Harvey's Rid of Me, the Breeders' Pod, Jawbreaker's 24 Hour Revenge Therapy, Superchunk's No Pocky for Kitty, and multiple albums by the Jesus Lizard. In later years, he recorded albums for Joanna Newsom, Ty Segall, Cloud Nothings, Sun O))), Laura Jane Grace, and Code Orange. Albini opened the Chicago studio Electrical Audio in 1995, where he recorded until his death. In his free time, he was a successful poker player, winning two World Series of Poker bracelets.", "source": {"uri": "vulture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vulture"}, "authors": [{"uri":

You aren't going to mistake Jeff Lynne for sounding like anyone else behind the vocal booth, and Mutt Lange has done a fine job at making artists sound as close to perfection as possible whenever he steps behind the board. The best thing you can do is to let artists by themselves, and the late Steve Albini made a living out of celebrating the discrepancies.\n\nThat was always a facet of Albini's work, both with his various bands and in his producing role. A skilled musician, Albini subscribed to the notion of letting one's feel for the music override any kind of unwarranted technical prowess. Albini believed that real music was made in the heart and soul, and for the most part, you could leave the mind out of it.\n\nBecause the last thing that you would call most of Albini's productions is layered. There may be the occasional lift in the track, but the lion's share of every one of his mixes is about being as unrefined as possible, usually leaving in every piece of the band's performance and even amplifying some of the negative aspects of it.\n\nAlthough those blemishes would have been considered audio artefacts in the mix, they give every one of his albums a distinct character, either sounding deliberately unsophisticated or an absolute mess, depending on what the artist was going for. When combing through his catalogue of chaos, those few diamonds stick out and shine brighter than some producer's entire discography.\n\nWhile Albini often had his finger on the pulse of everything in indie rock, there are always those occasional songs that stick out as something special that could have only come from capturing a specific moment. It might be the easiest thing to listen to half the time, but music like this isn't supposed to be nice. It's supposed to shake you up, and Albini has done his fair share of shaking.\n\nAlbini was always a punk at heart. From the first time he got involved with music, he was keen on making the kind of music that could scare someone half to death or annoy them to the point of never wanting to turn on that music again. It certainly wasn't for everyone, but when Albini first got started with Big Black, Atomiser was one of his first opportunities to work behind the board.\n\nAlthough Albini took a back seat throughout most of the production, his determination to make the filthiest music possible isn't lost on anyone. The songs might sound like absolute mayhem half the time, but the lyrics are much more poignant than most would have given them credit for, eventually inspiring people like Dave Grohl when he first started hearing them in Chicago. Atomiser may have been described as \"lease-breaking\" music by many, but Albini's dissonant noise was his first step toward becoming a musical giant. It would lay the foundations of an impressive career.\n\nIf you really think about it, folk seems to be the last place for a guy who once fronted Big Black. He may have had his mellow moments, sure, but the man responsible for some of the most abrasive punk rock of the 1980s suddenly embracing acoustic guitars is like watching Angus Young develop a taste for mariachi-style guitar playing. There's a definite divide between the genres, but Viva Last Blues makes that divide seem like nothing at all.\n\nWhat Albini might not have experienced with raw rock and roll, he made up for by knowing the sound of someone's heart. Throughout the album, Will Oldham opens himself up to his audience, and Albini knew that his job was about capturing that emotion on tape rather than trying to take the opportunity to grandstand. There may be a few distinct touches in the production here and there, but when looking at how much Oldham put into every song, this feels like the album that should be listed as 'recorded by Steve Albini' rather than produced by him.\n\nFailure seems to be unfairly written out of the story of alternative rock half the time. While some connoisseurs might know tracks like 'Stuck On You' from the late 1990s boom of alt-rock, their style always toed the line between listening to the heaviest band you've ever heard combined with the melodic hooks of a 1960s-style rock and roll band. Fantastic Planet may have been a few years ahead, but Albini helped the band get in touch with their feral side when they first walked into the studio.\n\nDespite being one of the heavier bands to come out of the late 1990s, Comfort borders on metal in places for how cutthroat it can get, as Albini pushes everything as far as he can. Even though some of the guitars sound fuzzy as hell, it's less about pushing the volume and more about adding texture, making the song sound like it's settling into a hypnotic groove rather than hitting you with flashy solos. Failure would get a lot prettier from here, but what they made in their prime could never have been without Albini laying down the ropes first. It was through his sturdy production techniques that the group was allowed to gild their output with a few more grams of gold.\n\nBy the time the Manic Street Preachers reached the 2000s, they had already done enough soul-searching for any band to have to endure. Although the band may have started out in the glam tradition with Richey Edwards, their pivot towards straight-ahead rock following their songwriter's disappearance felt like starting at ground zero again. They had already been working out the bugs for years, so now that they were back on track, why not strip everything down again?\n\nCompared to the other pointed entries in the band's catalogue, Albini helped turn this album into their unique take on art rock, putting together their usual cynical lyrics with tracks that seem to switch between different styles depending on what the lyrics call for. It's not exactly the easiest Manic Street Preachers album to start out with, but once you've sunk your teeth into their classic work, this is what it sounds like when they are finally stripped down to their raw essence. It's not the first record one thinks of when thinking about Albini's body of work, but it lands with a hefty aplomb.\n\nFrom the minute that he worked with Nirvana, it seemed like everyone wanted a piece of Steve Albini. Despite being one of the last people that music executives would describe as 'commercial', the alternative rock scene saw dollar signs when looking at his rap sheet with other famous names. While Albini eventually worked his magic for post-grunge acts like Bush, his heart was always in making the real alternative stars like The Breeders.\n\nFormed from the ashes of Pixies, The Breeders' Pod feels like the lost Kim Deal solo album we never got. Although most of the album was formed out of songs that Deal had written on her own, this feels like a different animal with Albini behind the board again, stripping away the polished production of the last few records in favour of something that sounds like the band making sonic architecture on the spot.\n\nConsidering this was released in 1990, it feels like Kurt Cobain could have taken his entire ethos for In Utero directly from this album, making Albini the only choice for the record.\n\nIt's not exactly fair to judge Albini as this angry producer who only makes the most abrasive music possible. Albini may have a penchant for getting the most unhinged performances he can out of anyone he works with, but there's much more to authentic recording than just capturing the raw material. It's about setting up a scene, and Joanna Newsom's Ys is one of the prettiest records he has ever made.\n\nThen again, there isn't much that Albini could possibly improve regarding Newsom's voice, taking the same kind of earthy production of his previous effort and pairing it with one of the best voices in indie music. Whereas other aspects of Albini's work have felt like expressionist paintings set to music, Newsomeis looking to paint intricate masterpieces, never being satisfied until the entire track feels like it's breathing on its own. It might not be as produced as other folk albums, but songs don't always need a sonic sheen to shine this bright.\n\nThe ending of Led Zeppelin felt like the wind had been knocked out of the entire music industry. They seemed like titans among men, and John Bonham's death reducing them to just ordinary musicians without a band was impossible to conceive of. There was a slim chance the band would ever get back together again, but Albini got the next best thing when Jimmy Page and Robert Plant decided to reminisce.\n\nWhile Walking Into Clarksdale is anything but a traditional rock and roll record, Albini's signature touch to production helped get the most out of the two rock titans, with Plant turning in some of his best vocal performances. Rather than try to make the masterpieces that Page could do on guitar, a lot of the album feels like you're given a look into a jam session in the middle of the studio, featuring the band improvising stuff on the fly, depending on where the music's taking them. It's no Zeppelin, something which would have ultimately disappointed the punk Albini, but there are some faint wisps of the band they could have become had 'Bonzo' not passed away.\n\nAs the 1990s began, the riot-grrl movement was just underway. Whereas the first punk movement may have been about liberation from rock and roll traditions, this was the moment where everyone from Bikini Kill was setting their sights on becoming the female counterparts to the first wave, making songs that were intended to be a middle finger back at the patriarchy. Whereas many people wanted to be the female John Lydon, PJ Harvey used Albini to turn her into the punk rock Bob Dylan.\n\nWhile Albini's production style didn't leave that much room for people to hear the lyrics, you're hanging on every word Harvey says whenever she steps up to the microphone. Whether that's covering Dylan, talking about her place in the world or dumping out the occasional love song, this is probably one of the best examples of Albini working with an eclectic range of styles.\n\nHe may have been the thorn in the side of professional recording sometimes, but no amount of studio trickery can replace performances like this. It was Albini's nature that gave his artists the courage to stand up and be unafraid of what they let loose in the studio. This was his most sincere skill.\n\nEvery producer has to get their start somewhere. No one is going to rise right out of the gate and convince themselves that their first gig is going to be working with Brian Wilson or Paul McCartney. That was never Albini's style, anyway, but his first go-around with Pixies had a certain lightning-in-a-bottle energy that was impossible to duplicate on the band's later records.\n\nSince production veteran Gil Norton would become famous for making the future Pixies albums, hearing Albini's laid-back production on Surfer Rosa is actually a breath of fresh air. Considering how perfect some of their later material sounds, tracks like 'Where Is My Mind' and 'Gigantic' feel like Albini captured a specific moment in time, taking the basis of what the band had done already and making it shine just a little bit more.\n\nConsidering how much banter they left in the final mix, the whole thing feels like the greatest alternative band of all time that just happen to be performing down the street. It is the epitome of what made Albini such a vital cog in some of the greats' finest work.\n\nBy the end of 1992, Kurt Cobain wanted anything but clean production for the next Nirvana record. Nevermind may have given them fame and fortune, but no one wanted the band to go from indie darlings to one of the biggest bands in the world overnight. It was time for a change, and Cobain figured that the best way to make the anti-commercial record was to get Albini for In Utero.\n\nCompared to Butch Vig's slick sounds on the last record, Albini leaves every blemish in In Utero, capturing the sound of the band playing as raucous as they can. In this case, that's not really a bad thing, especially considering the band wanted to make the louder, raw counterpart to Nevermind, which gave 'Heart-Shaped Box' and 'Pennyroyal Tea' a real kick in the ass.\n\nEven though it can be pretty when it wants to be, Cobain's unintentional epitaph for his career captures both the raw beauty and the rock and roll juggernaut that Nirvana had always been. It goes down as Albini's most celebrated work, distilling his warts and all ethos for making music.", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"},

Unquestionably a giant of American indie rock, he seemed to be in the midst of a personal & professional renaissance,\" wrote music critic Steven Hyden on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n\"He was always interesting, even when he was maddening. And his drum sound is one of the greatest in recorded music. RIP.\"\n\nThe U.S. Sun has reached out to Electrical Audio for comment.\n\nThe Haus of Decline podcast wrote on X: \"RIP Steve Albini. This is f**king awful. We interacted a few times on here. I am not exaggerating when I say The Breeders' Pod has the greatest production of any album ever. A true genius. I will miss him terribly.\"\n\nActor Elijah Wood called Albini's death a \"heartbreaking loss of a legend.\"\n\nPrimavera Sound, where Albini and his band regularly performed wrote: \"We have lost a legend, a friend, a member of our family. What are we going to do without you, Steve?\"\n\n\"After having welcomed them at 15 editions of the festival, it is impossible for us to imagine a Primavera Sound without him, because no band explains us better than Shellac.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cheyenne_r_ubiera@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Cheyenne R.

It was a controversial innovation at the time, from a man whose career would be defined by risky choices. The band's best-known song, the ugly, explosive, six-minute \"Kerosene\" from their cult favorite album, 1986's \"Atomizer,\" is ideal evidence -- and not for the faint of heart.\n\nThen came the short-lived band Rapeman -- one of two groups Mr. Albini fronted with indefensibly offensive names and vulgar song titles. In the early '90s, he formed Shellac, the ferocious, distorted noise-rock band -- an evolution from Big Black, but still punctuated by pummeling guitar tones and aggressive vocals.\n\nIn 1997, Mr. Albini opened his famed studio, Electrical Audio, in Chicago.\n\n\"The recording part is the part that matters to me -- that I'm making a document that records a piece of our culture, the life's work of the musicians that are hiring me,\" he told The Guardian last year, when asked about some of the well-known and much-loved albums he's recorded. \"I take that part very seriously. I want the music to outlive all of us.\"\n\nHe was a larger-than-life character in the independent rock music scene, known for his forward-thinking productions, unapologetic irreverence, acerbic sense of humor, and criticisms of the music industry's exploitative practices -- as detailed in his landmark 1993 essay \"The Problem with Music\" -- as much as his talents.\n\nLater in life, he became a notable poker player and apologetic for his past indiscretions.\n\n\"Ugh man, a heartbreaking loss of a legend. Love to his family and innumerable colleagues,\" wrote actor Elijah Wood on X. \"Farewell, Steve Albini.\"\n\nAuthor Michael Azerrad, who included a chapter on Big Black in his comprehensive history, \"Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981-1991,\" also posted on X. \"I don't know what to say about Steve Albini's passing,\" Azerrad wrote. \"He had a brilliant mind, was a great artist and underwent the most remarkable and inspiring personal transformation. I can't believe he's gone.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_(band)",

Staff at his studio, Electrical Audio, confirmed the news to Pitchfork.\n\nRelated: The evolution of Steve Albini: 'If the dumbest person is on your side, you're on the wrong side'\n\nAs well as fronting the bands Big Black, Rapeman and Shellac, who all pushed at the boundaries of post-punk and art-rock, Albini also produced - or, to use his preferred term, engineered - albums by Nirvana, Pixies, PJ Harvey and Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. He was noted for his DIY and punk ethos, resisting streaming services and refusing to take royalties from the recordings he produced for other artists.\n\nShellac were preparing their first album since 2014, To All Trains, for release next week.\n\nBorn in California in 1962, Albini's musical inspirations came from the punk movement, chiefly the Ramones but also the weirder end of the genre with bands such as Devo and Pere Ubu. He moved to the suburbs of Chicago to study journalism, and was drawn into the fertile underground music scene in the city, contributing to zines and working for the punk label Ruthless Records.\n\nHe started his own musical project, Big Black, initially a solo endeavour that soon became a quartet. Their debut album Atomizer was released in 1986, and the second album, Songs About Fucking - characterised by its seething guitar tone and drum machine pulses - became a landmark in the decade's US punk scene and earned an admirer in Robert Plant, who later had Albini produce his album with Jimmy Page, Walking Into Clarksdale.\n\nBig Black had already split up by the time Songs About Fucking was released - \"I prefer to cut it off rather than have it turn into another Gross Rock Spectacle\" - Albini reasoned - and he founded his next band Rapeman in 1987. Named after a Japanese manga, it was perhaps the most high-profile example of Albini's eagerness to prod and provoke, and he later expressed regret for the band name, calling it \"flippant\".\n\nMindful of not wanting to hop between band projects, Albini has said he wanted his next band to endure - and they did. Shellac, formed in 1992, became a singular light in the US art-rock scene, playing a minimalist yet playfully rhythmic style with riveting interplay between Albini, drummer Todd Trainer and bassist Bob Weston. They released five albums, plus To All Trains coming next week.\n\nAlongside his own music, he nurtured his craft behind the mixing desk. A prominent early credit came on Surfer Rosa, the 1988 debut by Pixies, followed by numerous others as the grunge scene flourished in the early 90s: the Jesus Lizard, Tad, the Breeders and more. He helped to define the raw sound of PJ Harvey's Rid Of Me in 1993, and that year had perhaps his most famous credit: Nirvana's famously forbidding In Utero, the follow-up to Nevermind.\n\nAlbini became adored by musicians for his unpretentious approach, foregrounding the intentions of each artist rather than bringing in a particular production flavour. He also favoured analogue techniques, brusquely announcing \"fuck digital\" on the sleevenotes to Songs About Fucking.\n\nHis success allowed him to set up Electrical Audio in 1995, and he appeared in the credits for numerous other landmark acts in American indie that went way beyond the noisy work he was generally known for: Joanna Newsom, Low, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion and others. British artists such as Manic Street Preachers, Mogwai and Jarvis Cocker also sought his expertise.\n\nAmong those paying tribute to Albini were the actor Elijah Wood, who said his death was \"a heartbreaking loss of a legend\".", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_(band)",

In the end it was so successful that after the recordings there were rumors that the studio would rather not release the record because they considered the scratchy sound Albini had achieved to be unsaleable and therefore needed to be mixed again.\n\nAlbini also worked on PJ Harvey's album \"Rid of Me\" as well as dozens of other releases, including classic rock records.

After falling in love with music thanks to early punk records by the likes of The Ramones, Devo, and The Sex Pistols, he moved from California to Illinois for college, where he immersed himself in the underground Chicago music scene and began to make a name for himself as well. Throughout the '80s, he played with two of his own bands, Big Black and the unfortunately named but shortlived project, Rapeman.\n\nDuring this time, Albini also began to produce and engineer albums for a variety of indie acts, working on iconic albums by the Pixies and The Jesus Lizard. This strong resume eventually earned him the job of recording Nirvana's third album, In Utero. Following the success of Nevermind, the group wanted to return to their more indie rock roots and felt that Albini could achieve their desired sound. Despite some disagreements over the final mix, the album did create a less traditional-sounding major label record for the group.\n\nWhile he was sought out for his distinct engineering ability, Steve Albini also had deep-seated reservations regarding the music industry and how it treated artists. He often refused to accept royalty payments on albums he produced, most famously accepting a flat $100,000 fee from Nirvana instead of earning future royalties which would have netted him much more income.\n\nIn later years, Albini continued his work in the studio while dedicating time to his music project, Shellac.

He recorded Nirvana's In Utero, Pixies' influential Surfer Rosa, PJ Harvey's Rid of Me, and countless groundbreaking albums.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nAlbini, the iconic indie rock producer and artist, died of a heart attack Wednesday at age 61. His Chicago-based recording studio, Electric Audio, confirmed the news.\n\nAlbini, born in Pasadena, California, on July 22, 1962, was an outspoken critic of the music business and the routine ways artists are exploited. He preferred \"engineer\" over \"producer\" as he wanted the artists he worked with to sound like themselves.\n\nHe was raised in Montana, moved to Evanston, Illinois, for college, and earned a degree from Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. Albini also fronted the bands Shellac and Big Black.\n\nTo celebrate the life and work of Albini, here's a list of five must-hear recordings from a contrarian studio legend.\n\n\"High Gear\" from Acme by The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion (1998)\n\nAlbini mixed \"High Gear\" from New York blues and garage rock revivalists The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. Spencer gained underground prominence with Pussy Galore, and his group's bass-less punk blues predates both The White Stripes and The Black Keys. During his career, Albini became a magnet for underground bands who unwittingly shaped the mainstream.\n\n\"Then Comes Dudley\" from Goat by The Jesus Lizard (1991)\n\nThe Jesus Lizard is an influential noise rock band that found an underground ally in Albini. The group's early releases on Chicago's Touch and Go Records influenced Nirvana, Henry Rollins, and Helmet. Many Nirvana songs from In Utero are direct descendants of The Jesus Lizard, and Albini's spacious drum sounds and hands-off approach are essential to his legacy.\n\n\"Rid of Me\" from Rid of Me by PJ Harvey (1993)\n\nPolly Jean Harvey's second album is another Albini-engineered classic. Following her debut Dry, she nervously signed to Island Records, fearing she might lose creative control. She didn't. Harvey is a singular force, something she shared with Albini.\n\nHarvey explained Albini's recording methods: \"The way that some people think of producing is to sort of help you to arrange or contributing or playing instruments; he does none of that. He just sets up his microphones in a completely different way from which I've ever seen anyone set up mics before, and that was astonishing.\"\n\n\"Scentless Apprentice\" from In Utero by Nirvana (1993)\n\nIf you are not testing the volume limits of your speakers, you are listening to this song incorrectly. When Nirvana gathered to record their masterpiece In Utero, they were reacting against the overwhelming commercial success and sonic slickness of Nevermind. However, before Albini committed to working with the planet's biggest band, he wrote them a letter outlining his list of demands.\n\nHere's what he wrote: \"I'm only interested in working on records that legitimately reflect the band's own perception of their music and existence. If you will commit yourselves to that as a tenet of the recording methodology, then I will bust my a- for you.\"\n\n\"Where Is My Mind?\" from Surfer Rosa by Pixies (1988)\n\nWithout Pixies' debut album, rock and roll would sound very different. Kurt Cobain wouldn't have written \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" Thom Yorke probably doesn't write \"Creep.\" Rivers Cuomo may not have traded heavy metal guitar solos for the songs on Weezer's Blue Album, and it's doubtful Billy Corgan and Smashing Pumpkins emerge from Chicago with quiet verses and loud choruses. The \"loudQUIETloud\" songwriting of Black Francis and the DIY ideals of Steve Albini inspired kids to form bands.

All About The Legendary Producer Of Nirvana As He Dies At 61", "body": "Steve Albini produced Nirvana's Album In Utero, which sold 5 million albums in the US\n\nSteve Albini, the vocalist, guitarist and producer for Iconic bands including Nirvana, Pixies and PJ Harvey, reportedly died aged 61 from a heart attack suffered at his recording studio on May 7, 2024.\n\nThe death of the alternative rock pioneer and legendary producer Steve Albini was confirmed by Brian Fox, an engineer at Albini's studio, Electrical Audio Recording, which opened in 1997 in Chicago.\n\nAlbini was recruited to Nirvana by the Late Kurt Cobain to record the 1993 follow-up to their hugely successful Album Nevermind. Albini, who impressed Kurt with his work with Big Black, The Pixies and The Breeders, created In Utero Alongside Nirvana, selling five million copies in the US alone.\n\nIn addition to working with Iconic rock bands, he was the frontman of the underground bands Big Black and Shellac. According to the Associated Press, at the time of his death, Shellac were preparing to tour their first new album in a decade, \"To All Trains.\" He is survived by his wife, the filmmaker Heather Whinna. Here's everything you need to know about the Legendary producer in the wake of his death.\n\nSteve Albini and Heather Whinna Met in the 90s\n\nAs per reports, Steve Albini, who was born in California, reportedly fell in love with the punk music scene in Chicago while studying journalism at Northwestern University. While at College in the 80s, he founded the abrasive, noisy post-punk band Big Black. In the 90s, he formed Shellac, an evolution from Big Black with ferocious and abrasive rock sounds.\n\nAccording to the Guardian, Albini met his wife, Heather Whinna, in the 90's. Kim Deal of the Pixies and the Breeders, a close friend of Albini's, told the Guardian last year Heather Whinna was a crucial influence in his life. According to her LinkedIn, Whinna, who works as a filmmaker, has produced and directed a few documents over three decades. Whinna, who has been self-employed by Right Right Right Films since June 2001, has also worked as an event producer for And Now For The Kicker since June 1991.\n\nIn a 2015 article for Huffington Post, Steve Albini spoke about his and his wife's charitable endeavors. The article \" Why I Haven't Had a Conventional Christmas in 20 Years \" discusses the couple helping low-income families during the holiday season. Whinna, who lives in Chicago, also started Poverty Alleviation Chicago in December 1995.\n\nIn the wake of her husband's death, Heather has yet to issue a statement. Meanwhile, actor Elijah Wood took to social media to pay tribute to the legendary rock producer, writing, \"A heartbreaking loss of a legend\".\n\nPer multiple reports, Albini was also a celebrated poker player, winning two coveted bracelets at World Series of Poker tournaments.\n\nMust Read: Baby Reindeer Ending Explained: Does Donny Turn Into Another Martha?", "source": {"uri": "koimoi.com",

The famed producer was known for prioritising the music above all else, ensuring that the final product sounded like a live band playing together in a room, regardless of the challenges faced. But Albini was more than just a man in a studio; he approached music on his own terms, unfazed by industry jargon or conventions.\n\nAfter moving out of Montana, Albini finally found his calling in the world of punk rock when he moved to Chicago. Although he seemed set in his ways regarding his personal taste, Albini never settled for anything less than inauthentic whenever he played music. Everything needed to come from the heart, and Big Black became his vehicle for fully expressing himself.\n\nTaking the sounds of noise rock and hardcore punk to their most logical conclusion, half of Big Black's catalogue is still some of the most caustic punk rock ever pressed to vinyl. They weren't meant to give any chartoppers a run for their money, but that wasn't really Albini's bag anyway. Music was supposed to be fun for a reason, and if it only catered to a specific audience, that was completely fine with him.\n\nWhile Big Black may not have sold Beatles-level numbers, or even the Ramones for that matter, they had a massive influence on everyone who listened, including a young Kurt Cobain. After playing their last-ever gig in Seattle, Cobain managed to take a piece of Albini's smashed guitar after the show was over.\n\nOnce Albini turned his focus towards production, though, he still had that same mentality. Despite being known as the punk-rock guy who played loud, abrasive music, he always looked to serve what the artist wanted, whether he worked with Pixies or Killdozer. The number one rule of any producer is learning to mix what you want to hear, and Albini's entire MO was to make everything sound as real as possible.\n\nThroughout everything from Surfer Rosa by Pixies to PJ Harvey's Rid of Me, you're hearing the artist with little to no mask on. It may seem a bit dry, but Albini didn't want to make the most pristine guitar part in the world. If the record sounded honest, that was much more important than if you got every single line absolutely perfect.\n\nEven when working with big acts like Nirvana, Albini didn't roll over just because some suit figured they'd keep up with trends. Albini's punk mentality focused on going against the mainstream, and he would have rather given a stiff middle finger to anyone who claimed that they knew more about the music he produced than he did.\n\nIf you ask anyone who worked with him, Albini was also known to be extremely focused on making the best record possible. He never mistook authenticity for laziness, and if he thought that something belonged on the record or sounded better with a certain effect on it, he would fight tooth and nail to make sure he made the best song he could.\n\nFor every band that he worked with, Albini took a flat fee, never wanting to share points on the record and try to make a quick buck off of someone who put their heart and soul into it. As far as he could tell, his job was to be the vehicle for which the artist could turn the sounds in their head into a reality, and for him, that meant being paid like a contract worker rather than a business tycoon.\n\nFor every snooty industry type who turned their nose up at Albini's techniques, the true artists usually understood his genuine character. Before he even had the idea of turning his hobby into a full-time career, Albini ended up kickstarting James Murphy's drive for music without even knowing it.\n\nGrowing up in Brooklyn, Murphy credited Albini for changing his life, telling Sonic Highways, \"I wrote Steve a letter from an address I got somewhere...He sent me designs on how to build a studio. I was a kid. That's not a dick. That changed my life.

And We're All Better for It.", "body": "Steve Albini produced one of the greatest albums in rock history, and he wanted everyone to know that he hated it.\n\n\"A patchwork pinch loaf from a band who at their top dollar best are blandly entertaining college rock\" was how he described the Pixies' 1988 debut, Surfer Rosa, which he helmed. \"Their willingness to be 'guided' by their manager, their record company and their producers is unparalleled. Never have I seen four cows more anxious to be led around by their nose rings.\"\n\nIt was 1991, and Albini was -- by choice! -- writing this for the magazine Forced Exposure, within a column detailing his thoughts on various albums he had worked on. As Albini explained before his \"pinch loaf\" diatribe, potential future slander was literally part of the deal with him. \"When I am hired to record a band,\" Albini wrote, \"I make it plain to my clients that I do not wish to be associated with their charming little records. I will do a good job for them, but that does not include shouldering any responsibility for their lousy tastes and mistakes.\"\n\nIn time, Albini, who died on Tuesday at 61 from a heart attack, would soften his stance on Surfer Rosa. But the lore of Albini's propensity for scorched-earth comments -- often directed at the music industry as a machine, but often at other musicians -- isn't something that can be revised. It's doubtful he would want it to be, either.\n\nIn the same way that Albini believed in capturing the sound of a band in its simplest and most honest form, he seemed to also believe in engaging with the press in as candid a way as possible. It's unclear whether he was regularly offering a window into the dizzying world inside his head as a privilege or a punishment. It was, after all, the same twisted head that wrote a Big Black song about a child sex ring, or that named one of his other groups Rapeman. Quite often, what was rattling inside his bespectacled noggin was pure disdain or anger -- or at the very least just some desire to provoke. And Albini was fine with sharing that, and accepted the consequences. By the end of his life, anyway, he was quite aware of how absurd he was often being.\n\n\"you can make an eclipse any time by holding up your thumn,\" he wrote last month on Bluesky, having already become too much of a hater of X to stay on that platform in the Elon Musk era. \"I can wreck anything I'm that guy. don't get me started on bottled water. bike lanes. anything really, just don't get me started.\"\n\nThere is some irony to the fact that a world-class hater like Albini -- someone who, if his old roommate is to be believed, used to literally answer the phone with \"Fuck you!\" -- also lived his life under a strict moral code. The most obvious way this code manifested itself was that Albini would effectively negotiate himself out of money before starting any project, rejecting the industry norm of producers taking a percentage of an album's future profits. As he saw it, an album is the band's creative work, and his job was only to help them manifest it.\n\n\"I would like to be paid like a plumber,\" he told Nirvana in an \"are you sure you want to do this\" letter, before agreeing to produce what would be their 1993 album, In Utero. Albini, who once dismissed Nirvana as \"R.E.M. with a fuzzbox\" (as if that's a bad thing), estimated at the time that he was leaving $400,000 on the table, assuming the record would sell 3 million copies. He was wrong on that; In Utero ended up selling 15 million copies, meaning he missed out on a few million. \"There's no fucking way I would ever take that much money,\" he said of the $400,000. \"I wouldn't be able to sleep.\"\n\nIt's not like the guy was loaded in some other way. Albini's bands -- Big Black, Rapeman, and Shellac most prominent among them -- never had anything resembling a hit song or record, and he came from modest means. According to a 1994 Chicago magazine profile, Albini's father was the first in his family to complete any amount of formal schooling, which he miraculously did with doctorates in mathematics and aerodynamics, as well as a master's in philosophy. (He became an engineer notable for his work in the modeling of forest fires.) Albini's mother was described as \"an archetype of a Rockwellian caregiver\" who would invite parolees to holiday dinners and fostered Vietnamese and Laotian children.\n\nAlbini entered college with a surprisingly idealistic goal: He wanted to become a journalist because \"on a fundamental level I thought writing down what happens now is important for the future,\" he said on Marc Maron's WTF podcast in 2015. His heroes were Woodward, Bernstein, and the Ramones. The Ramones ended up winning out in time, but the journalistic impulse persisted in Albini's creation of zines, and ultimately in the way he approached music.\n\nIn that letter to Nirvana, Albini laid out his mindset of capturing artists as they are, rather than dolling them up to be something they're not. \"I like to leave room for accidents or chaos,\" he wrote. \"Making a seamless record, where every note and syllable is in place and every bass drum is identical, is no trick. Any idiot with the patience and the budget to allow such foolishness can do it.\"\n\nIt's easy to gloss over how brazen it was to insist on this for a band following up Nevermind, one of the biggest records ever released -- which, notably, is a seamless record, where every note and syllable is in place. Nevermind producer Butch Vig layered the instruments over and over -- and while the results are undeniable, Kurt Cobain would later say he was \"embarrassed\" by the sound of it. (\"It's closer to a M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce record than it is a punk rock record,\" he said.) In Utero, with its jagged notes and shrill feedback left delightfully high in the mix, was a kick in the ass to the higher-ups at Nirvana's DGC Records, who felt that the album was \"unreleasable,\" according to Albini. (Nirvana eventually allowed for some remixing to be done on the record before it was released.) What Albini demanded of Nirvana was nothing short of a full-fledged attack on the powers that be.\n\nIn the wake of In Utero, Albini temporarily had trouble finding more production work. Talking to The Guardian last year, he said that his profile had become too high for the lower-end bands and too risky for more major-label work, leaving him in a limbo. Pissing off DGC did not come without a price. \"That was direct fallout from [major labels] blaming me for Nirvana getting uppity,\" Albini said.\n\nGiven his tendency to hate on everything from the Pixies to bike lanes, it's reasonable to closely consider the motivations behind Albini's instinct to make enemies in the music industry. But according to him, his decisions as a producer were purely a reflection of what he thought was best from a musical standpoint -- a reflection of that journalistic impulse to document with impartiality, catering only to what he saw and heard in front of him.\n\n\"It's like if you see a beautiful woman,\" Albini told Maron, \"and she's wearing a pink frock and has lipstick on. And then you see a grizzly bear and you think, 'Well, maybe I should put lipstick and a dress on the bear.' All you're gonna do is piss off that bear.\"\n\nThis approach explains why there is no obvious Albini Sound. In the records that Albini has produced -- or, as he'd prefer to say, engineered -- you have to look for a through line of truthfulness, a lack of gimmicks, a clarity of vision, even if that vision ends up manifesting itself as something distorted and gnarled.\n\nOften, when you look at an Albini production within an act's discography, it's the record that could have been self-titled -- the record that serves as an encapsulation of who the artist really is, without necessarily tapping into the commercial potential that they could, theoretically, tap into: the Breeders' Pod, PJ Harvey's Rid of Me, Jawbreaker's 24 Hour Revenge Therapy, Songs: Ohia's The Magnolia Electric Co. Like a good journalist at work, he sought accuracy, but still found a way to inject his own personality in the margins. He was searching for how the story of the music should best be told, for the truth. There's a reason he became a world-class poker player: He could look at anyone and tell if they were bluffing.\n\nAlways an analog purist when it came to music, Albini was surprisingly adept at and welcoming to the online world. He ran a cooking blog and shitposted with abandon. (\"Christ the amount of human effort wasted to sound like an SNL band warm up,\" he wrote of his nemesis Steely Dan.) In some ways, the internet and its lack of barriers made it clear that he was just as prickly as he ever was when it came to certain topics, like electronic music. (\"I detest club culture as deeply as I detest anything on earth.\")\n\nAll of which made Albini's recent mea culpa in the press, in which he earnestly atoned for his previous \"edgelord\" tendencies, an almost shockingly mature turn from someone who once called Urge Overkill \"weiners in suits playing frat party rock, trying to tap a goofy trend that doesn't even exist.\" (OK, that one's still pretty funny, especially considering the band has been called his one-time \"pet project.\") In some sense, Albini's contrition was the act of a premier hater realizing that the final frontier of hating is one's own past. But it was also a welcome way for Albini to show that people can continue to grow at any age -- and it set the stage for him to continue to grow as a producer as well. For that next chapter to be cut so drastically short -- for him to die so suddenly, just a week before a new Shellac record is to be released -- is difficult to accept.\n\nAs the musical world has become increasingly cash-strapped, Albini's affordable, efficient recording services were more enticing than ever. That explains why some of the best Albini productions (like Cloud Nothings' Attack on Memory and Sunn O)))'s Life Metal and Pyroclasts) have come in his later years -- an extremely uncommon feat for a producer several decades into their career.\n\nOne recent project that stands out is Ty Segall's 2017 self-titled album, which is, indeed, as good a summary of Segall's sprawling career as one could get. Out of dozens of various Segall releases, the casual genre hopping of Ty Segall offers the most distilled essence of one of indie rock's most enigmatic figures; it looks straight into the eyes of someone who has moved so fast over the years that it's often been difficult to get a good look at him. For his services, Albini received a flat fee, like a plumber.\n\nTo promote that album, there was some plumbing involved, as it happens. In a video posted by Segall's label, Drag City, Albini -- clad in a navy jumpsuit, like a custodian -- pushes a toilet off a ledge on what appears to be the loading area of Electrical Audio, his studio in Chicago. The toilet shatters, and then Segall jumps in with an axe, smashing the rest to bits. Albini, having engineered this scene for Segall to seize upon, gazes on the ruins and flashes a thumbs up.

Maybe in the next few days, we could talk about his impact, which was immense,\" Fox said in an email.\n\nAlbini's death came little more than a week before his longtime band Shellac was set to release a new album, To All Trains, on May 17. It will be the band's first album since 2014.\n\nFirst developing an interest in punk after being introduced to the Ramones as a teen, Albini voraciously consumed all the new music he could find growing up in his hometown of Missoula, Montana, and played in his earliest music projects. After graduating high school, he moved to Evanston, Illinois, to attend journalism school at Northwestern University, immersing himself in the scene as a fan and a writer for local music magazines.\n\nAlbini began his music career in 1981 when he formed the punk rock band Big Black while a student at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University.\n\nHe later went on to form two other bands, the controversially named Rapeman and Shellac, with the latter the longest-existing and arguably the most important band of his career as a performer. For Shellac, he performed vocals and guitar alongside bassist Bob Weston and drummer Todd Trainer.\n\nHe also helped record and track some of the most influential albums of the alternative rock era in the 1980s and 1990s, including Nirvana's \"In Utero,\" Pixies' \"Surfer Rosa,\" PJ Harvey's \"Rid of Me,\" Veruca Salt's EP \"Blow It Out Your A** It's Veruca Salt,\" and multiple albums for Urge Overkill and The Jesus Lizard.\n\nHe also helped record music for legends such as Cheap Trick, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, and Foo Fighters, who recorded their hit song \"Something from Nothing\" at his Electrical Audio studio in Chicago.\n\nJewish parents respond to campus protests\n\nAppeals court to review decision that kept DA Fani Willis on Trump case\n\nWhat led to Drake and Kendrick

Staff at his studio, Electrical Audio, confirmed the news to Pitchfork.\n\nAs well as fronting the bands Big Black, Rapeman and Shellac, who all pushed at the boundaries of post-punk and art-rock, Albini also produced - or, to use his preferred term, engineered - albums by Nirvana, Pixies, PJ Harvey and Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. He was noted for his DIY and punk ethos, resisting streaming services and refusing to take royalties from the recordings he produced for other artists.\n\nShellac were preparing their first album since 2014, To All Trains, for release next week.\n\nBorn in California in 1962, Albini's musical inspirations came from the punk movement, chiefly the Ramones but also the weirder end of the genre with bands such as Devo and Pere Ubu. He moved to the suburbs of Chicago to study journalism, and was drawn into the fertile underground music scene in the city, contributing to zines and working for the punk label Ruthless Records.\n\nHe started his own musical project, Big Black, initially a solo endeavour that soon became a quartet. Their debut album Atomizer was released in 1986, and the second album, Songs About F*cking - characterised by its seething guitar tone and drum machine pulses - became a landmark in the decade's US punk scene and earned an admirer in Robert Plant, who later had Albini produce his album with Jimmy Page, Walking Into Clarksdale.\n\nBig Black had already split up by the time Songs About F*cking was released - \"I prefer to cut it off rather than have it turn into another Gross Rock Spectacle\" - Albini reasoned and he founded his next band Rapeman in 1987. Named after a Japanese manga, it was perhaps the most high-profile example of Albini's eagerness to prod and provoke, and he later expressed regret for the band name, calling it \"flippant\".\n\nMindful of not wanting to hop between band projects, Albini has said he wanted his next band to endure - and they did. Shellac, formed in 1992, became a singular light in the US art-rock scene, playing a minimalist yet playfully rhythmic style with riveting interplay between Albini, drummer Todd Trainer and bassist Bob Weston. They released five albums, plus To All Trains coming next week.\n\nAlongside his own music, he nurtured his craft behind the mixing desk. A prominent early credit came on Surfer Rosa, the 1988 debut by Pixies, followed by numerous others as the grunge scene flourished in the early 1990s: the Jesus Lizard, Tad, the Breeders and more. He helped to define the raw sound of PJ Harvey's Rid Of Me in 1993, and that year had perhaps his most famous credit: Nirvana's famously forbidding In Utero, the follow-up to Nevermind.\n\nAlbini became adored by musicians for his unpretentious approach, foregrounding the intentions of each artist rather than bringing in a particular production flavour. He also favoured analogue techniques, brusquely announcing \"fuck digital\" on the sleevenotes to Songs About Fucking.\n\nHis success allowed him to set up Electrical Audio in 1995, and he appeared in the credits for numerous other landmark acts in American indie that went way beyond the noisy work he was generally known for: Joanna Newsom, Low, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion and others. British artists such as Manic Street Preachers, Mogwai and Jarvis Cocker also sought his expertise.\n\nAmong those paying tribute to Albini were the actor Elijah Wood, who said his death was \"a heartbreaking loss of a legend\". - Guardian", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Jordi Vidal / Redferns via Getty Images\n\nSteve Albini, a leading light of indie rock's sound and morality as frontman of Big Black and Shellac and recording engineer for Nirvana, PJ Harvey and many other artists, has died at the age 61.\n\nThe news was confirmed to Variety on Wednesday by Taylor Hales, who works at Albini's Chicago recording studio, Electronic Audio.\n\nAlbini first rose to acclaim in the early 1980s as the frontman for Big Black, the Chicago-based trio known for aggressive guitar-based rock that worked with a drum machine rather than a live drummer, a rarity for the time.\n\nYet he was also well known for his equally aggressive criticism of musicians and others who he felt were in it for money or popularity rather than the music -- and he walked it like he talked it.\n\nHe reviled the term \"producer,\" even if that's arguably what he did on many recordings, and insisted on a \"Recorded by Steve Albini\" credit and declined any \"points\" -- i.e. royalties from the recordings he recorded -- which is a common financial bonus for most producers.\n\nHis at-times iconoclastic stance -- and his galvanizing work on the Pixies' landmark 1988 album \"Surfer Rosa\" -- endeared him to Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, who insisted that the band work with Albini on its second major label album, 1993's \"In Utero.\"\n\nThe hire was much to the chagrin of Nirvana's label, which was hoping for another speaker-shattering blockbuster similar to the group's breakthrough, \"Nevermind.\" \"In Utero\" was plenty loud, but not in the radio-friendly way they'd been angling for.\n\nAround the same time, Albini also recorded PJ Harvey's sophomore effort, \"Rid of Me,\" which had a similarly aggressive sound.\n\nAlbini also worked with acts such as Pixies, the Breeders, the Jesus Lizard, Mclusky, and even former Led Zeppelin members Jimmy Page and Robert Plant on their 1998 album \"Walking Into Clarksdale.\" The latter album in particular benefited from Albini's spare, no-frills sound, which was at odds with the duo's elaborate latter-day recordings.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [],

He was 61.\n\nAlbini was a household name in the music industry, but the world at large may know him better by those he worked with as a record producer, or, as he preferred to phrase it, \"recording engineer.\" Albini worked on Nirvana's 1993 album \"In Utero,\" Cheap Trick's 2003 album \"Special One\" and 2006 album \"Rockford,\" Led Zeppelin founders Jimmy Page and Robert Plant's 1998 album \"Walking into Clarksdale\" and Pixies' 1988 album \"Surfer Rosa,\" among many others.\n\nHe was also a prolific musician in his own right, most recently performing as the guitarist of the band Shellac, which he formed in 1992. The band's forthcoming album, \"To All Trains,\" was planned to be released on May 17.\n\nHe launched his music career while he was a student at Northwestern University. His band, Big Black, released their debut album \"Lungs\" in 1982 with Albini's friend, John Bohnen, playing saxophone and Albini playing all other instruments.\n\nFrom 1987 to 1988, Albini was part of a short-lived band controversially called Rapeman, inspired by the name of a Japanese manga series. Years later, on an April 2020 episode of Conan Neutron's Protonic Reversal podcast, Albini would admit that he regretted the name.\n\n\"Being frank, I don't think I've been held to account honestly for being in a band called Rapeman,\" he said. \"I mean, that's unconscionable. I feel like I've gotten a pass kind of on that, and I shouldn't. I feel like I should have to answer for that, and I have on occasion but not nearly to the extent that I think is warranted. It was a flippant choice that we made at the time, and it's unconscionable. It's indefensible.\"", "source": {"uri": "myfox8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "myfox8.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justyn_melrose@myfox8.com", "name": "Justyn Melrose", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pixies (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Led Zeppelin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_Audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrical Audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitchfork_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitchfork (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recording studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shellac (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_and_Plant", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Page and Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheap_Trick", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cheap Trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockford,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rockford, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rockford, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarksdale,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clarksdale, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clarksdale, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungs_(EP)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lungs (EP)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapeman", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_(talk_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conan (talk show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Black", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxophone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saxophone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northwestern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums_and_Frames", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums and Frames", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Classifieds", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://myfox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/GettyImages-156573289.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 959, "textEnd": 965}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-04-", "textStart": 1365, "textEnd": 1375}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The LP marked the follow-up to 'Ignore The Ignorant', was was shared with the band as a three-piece in May 2012. It was recorded at Electrical Audio with Albini as producer, and went on to peak at Number Nine on the UK albums charts. It was also ranked Number Eight on NME's 2012 Albums Of The Year list, and remains a fan favourite.\n\nThey then collaborated with Albini again five years later, when they were working on their seventh studio album '24-7 Rock Star Shit'. Also recorded at Electrical Audio, the album was shared in 2017 and praised by fans as seeing them return to their earlier punk and grunge roots.\n\nFollowing news of Albini's death, the band initially shared a photo of them with the producer at a recording studio with the simple caption \"THE BEST EVER\". They then went on to share a moving recollection of their time working together in a follow-up post.\n\n\"It's so hard to imagine Steve Albini being gone. He has been an almost constant touchstone in the lives of us brothers ever since we first heard one of his albums as 13-year-old kids. And then, since working together he has remained a presence as both someone that we always *knew* was there in our corner, but also just as a friend who we could exchange funny emails with,\" they wrote.\n\n\"When we first went out to Chicago to record with Steve in November of 2011, the sessions happened to run through Thanksgiving. When Steve found out we had no plans and nowhere to go, he immediately offered to have us - 3 guys he had just met - over to his place to have dinner with him and his family,\" the caption continued.\n\n\"So much for his \"difficult\" reputation. All those bullshit stories - the music industry was just afraid of him back then cos he was *honest*, and held no regard for the opinions of anyone involved in the commodification of music - a punk rocker, basically! His commitment was to the artist - and in that regard he was unparalleled. Working with him was a dream - he was the greatest engineer in the world, that goes without saying, but it was his respect and commitment to the art of recording that really set him apart.\n\n\"He taught us so much - literally sat down and taught us his recording techniques, with diagrams and written notes. In spite of Steve's ethos of being essentially a contractor - viewing his services as comparable to hiring a plumber for example - he genuinely cared about the album for us, even after it was finished [...] The greatest to ever do it. We know that, and have always felt deeply proud and grateful to have worked with him. I'm sure Steve would be cringing reading this. But it's all true. Just a great, great man.\"\n\nLater, drummer Ross Jarman also shared a touching tribute of his own, explaining the profound impact that Albini had on him and his bandmates. \"It's a funny thing to try to explain to someone, the connection you have with a person after making an album together. In a way you're tied to them forever,\" he wrote.\n\n\"When that person unexpectedly departs this world, you realise that the things you did can never happen again, and in that sense, a part of the band died along with them. None of this even takes into account that this individual was STEVE AL FUCKING BINI...\"\n\nAs a musician, Albini fronted the likes of underground bands such as Shellac, Big Black and Flour. Shellac recently announced 'To All Trains', their first album in 10 years which is set for release next week (May 17) and were preparing to embark on a tour.\n\nBack in 2017, shortly before the release of '24-7 Rock Star Shit', The Cribs spoke with NME about what it was like to rejoin forces with Albini - five years after they first began working together.\n\n\"We always thought our records would be made very quickly and very raw and over time we kind of softened our stance on that. I think since we first recorded with Steve Albini back in 2011 that has always been the next thing on the agenda,\" explained guitarist Ryan Jarman.\n\n\"[Albini] was so quick to make the record and I've always loved the sound of his album. The way that he records is like a path street and it's perfect for a band like us because it's a case of setting up live and playing live, getting the energy in a much more direct way than working with anyone else.\"\n\nFollowing the news of Albini's death, Pixies, Benefits and more have paid tribute to the late producer - you can read them here. Jarvis Cocker also recalled the impact that working with the producer during 'Further Complications' had on him, and you can read his full tribute here.", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType":

He was 61.\n\nThe cause was a heart attack, according to Taylor Hales of Electrical Audio, the studio in Chicago that Mr. Albini founded in 1997.\n\nWith a sharp vision for how a band should be recorded, and an even sharper tongue for anything he deemed mediocre or compromised, Mr. Albini was one of rock's most acerbic wits. He was also a withering critic of the exploitive extremes of the major-label music business, describing in a widely-quoted 1993 article, \"The Problem With Music,\" the ways that na\u00efve bands are lured into major deals with labels that, in most cases, leave them broke and in debt.\n\nIn the 1990s, when his work as a recording engineer -- he scoffed at being called a \"producer\" -- was in highest demand, however, Mr. Albini made no apology for accepting big checks for recording major-label bands. But those bands did so at their own risk; in those days Mr. Albini was also known for ridiculing the bands he recorded after the fact.\n\n\"Never have I seen four cows more anxious to be led around by their nose rings,\" he wrote after recording \"Surfer Rosa,\" the seminal 1988 album by the Boston-based band Pixies, which became one the classics of 1980s alt-rock.

He was 61. According to Pitchfork, Albini passed away after suffering a heart attack.\n\nBorn in Pasadena, California in 1962, Albini eventually moved with his family to Missoula, Montana in 1974. This is where he first began his musical journey, first learning to play bass while recovering from a broken leg. After high school, Albini moved to Evanston, Illinois to attend college at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Zao Official (@zaoband)\n\nIn the mid-80s, Albini began working as an audio engineer, working on many albums that are still considered to be some of the greatest of their respective genres. In addition to the aforementioned artists, Albini also worked with The Breeders, Hum, The Jesus Lizard, Superchunk, Cheap Trick, Chevelle, Neurosis, Bush, Flogging Molly, Gogol Bordello, Zao, Scott Weiland, Weedeater, Foxy Shazam, Sunn O))), Laura Jane Grace, and Code Orange.\n\nWhile in college, Albini formed his first band, Big Black. More than a decade later, he founded the band Shellac, which he remained part of until his death. The band is set to release their next album, To All Trains, sometime this year.\n\nAlbini's death has brought out many memorials from his fans and friends, with actor Elijah Wood writing in a social media post, \"Ugh man, a heartbreaking loss of a legend. Love to his family and innumerable colleagues. Farewell, Steve Albini.\"\n\nIn a collective statement, West Virginia metal band Zao -- whose 2006 album The Fear Is What Keeps Us Here was engineered by Albini -- offered their sympathies. \"Words can not express how devastated we are about the news of the passing of Steve Albini,\" the band said. \"One of the best recording experiences we have ever had. A total sweetheart, a true legend and an absolute master of his craft. Jeff was lucky enough to work with him again last November and there were discussions about potential future Zao collabs.\"\n\n\"Much love to Heather Whinna for introducing us to him years ago,\" they added. \"His impact on us has never been taken for granted.

The 61-year-old died of a heart attack, confirmed by staff at Albini's recording studio, Electric Audio, 2621 W. Belmont Ave., Pitchfork reported Wednesday.\n\nSteve Albini was famous as the recording engineer (a term he preferred over \"producer\") of such groundbreaking records as Nirvana's \"In Utero,\" the Pixies' \"Surfer Rosa,\" The Wedding Present's \"Seamonsters,\" P.J. Harvey's \"Rid of Me\" and several records by The Jesus Lizard, to name a few.\n\nAlbini also played in his own iconic bands, including Big Black, Rapeman and Shellac, which was set to tour this summer.\n\nBorn in Pasadena, California, Albini moved to the Chicago area to attend Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, where he began writing music criticism and working at local record stores.\n\nHe formed Big Black in 1981, followed by Rapeman in 1987 and Shellac in 1992. Shellac's upcoming release \"For All The Trains\" was to be the band's first in over a decade.\n\nAlbini was a frequent presence on the Electrical Audio Forum message board and on Twitter, where he described himself in his bio as a \"recording engineer who plays billiards and poker, and eats like a viking / I reflexively block blue check accounts and promoted tweets.\"\n\nAlbini most recently lived in the Ravenswood Gardens neighborhood. He told the Columbia College blog \"In the Loop\" why he stayed in Chicago in a 2017 interview:\n\n\"There's not a lot of bloodthirsty competition in Chicago. In places like New York and L.A. the cost of living is so high and the the notion of 'industry' is much more cemented. In L.A. there is a pop music industry, in New York there is a pop music industry, and there's competition to be part of that. The competition to beat other people to the brass ring or whatever, and I never get that feeling in Chicago.\"", "source": {"uri": "blockclubchicago.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Block Club

His death was confirmed by staff at his recording studio, Electric Audio, according to a report from Pitchfork.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nAlbini started in 1981, forming the band Big Black while he was in college. After a stint in the band Rapeman -- a name choice for which he later expressed regret -- he formed the band Shellac in 1992 with Bob Weston and Todd Trainer. Shellac released five studio albums, as well as a self-release in 1997 and a live album in 1994.\n\nAlthough he was integral in the indie scene as a frontman, he was prolific as a producer, although he refused most credit in liner notes. He preferred to be called a \"recording engineer,\" as he once told BoingBoing in 2014. Once in 2004, he estimated that he worked on at least 1,500 albums, most notably Nirvana's In Utero, PJ Harvey's Rid of Me, and Pixies Surfer Rosa. He also worked with The Breeders, Mogwai, Joanna Newsom, Bush, Chevelle, The Stooges, Manic Street Preachers, Cheap Trick, and Veruca Salt, among many others.\n\n[RELATED: Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic, and Steve Albini Talk Nirvana's 'In Utero' 30th Anniversary on 'Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend']\n\nSteve Albini's Life, Work, and Views of the Music Industry\n\nSteve Albini took a unique approach to recording music, as he preferred to let artists keep control of their creative project. The role of the \"recording engineer,\" in his opinion according to a 2004 feature in MTSU Sidelines, was to troubleshoot issues that arose during recording. He felt that producers often destroyed the recording process with a need for control. Albini, however, approached recording with a fast and loose style that brought exceptional results.\n\nWhile looking for a producer for In Utero, Kurt Cobain was drawn to the work Steve Albini was doing with PJ Harvey and Pixies. In 1992, Cobain told Rolling Stone, \"[In Utero] will be more raw with some songs and more candy pop on some of the others,\" citing that Nevermind was too polished and mainstream. Albini was using the natural acoustics of the recording studio by placing multiple mics in the room to aid in a more grungy sound and create a cohesive blend between Cobain, Dave Grohl, and Krist Novoselic.\n\nAlbini was a staunch purist when it came to recording, preferring analog and dismissing digital outright. He was a journalist, writing often for Matter in 1983, and published many essays such as \"The Problem with Music\" in the 1993 issue of The Baffler. He was critical of the music industry and worked primarily with underground and indie artists. However, he also would work with just about anyone who asked.\n\nFeatured Image by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for FYF", "source": {"uri": "americansongwriter.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The legendary producer and musician's death was confirmed by his recording studio, Electronic Audio.\n\nIn Albini's four-paged proposal, he famously declared that \"if a record takes more than a week to make, somebody's fucking up\".\n\n\"I think the very best thing you could do at this point is exactly what you are talking about doing: bang a record out in a couple of days, with high quality but minimal 'production' and no interference from the front office bulletheads,\" he wrote. \"If that is indeed what you want to do, I would love to be involved.\"\n\n\"If, instead, you might find yourselves in the position of being temporarily indulged by the record company, only to have them yank the chain at some point (hassling you to rework songs/sequences/production, calling-in hired guns to 'sweeten' your record, turning the whole thing over to some remix jockey, whatever...) then you're in for a bummer and I want no part of it.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I'm only interested in working on records that legitimately reflect the band's own perception of their music and existence. If you will commit yourselves to that as a tenet of the recording methodology, then I will bust my ass for you. I'll work circles around you.\"\n\nAlbini wrote of his recording methodology: \"I consider the band the most important thing, as the creative entity that spawned both the band's personality and style and as the social entity that exists 24 hours out of each day. I do not consider it my place to tell you what to do or how to play. I'm quite willing to let my opinions be heard (if I think the band is making beautiful progress or a heaving mistake, I consider it part of my job to tell them) but if the band decides to pursue something, I'll see that it gets done.\"\n\nHe then noted that he likes to \"leave room for accidents and chaos\". \"If every element of the music and dynamics of a band is controlled by click tracks, computers, automated mixes, gates, samplers and sequencers, then the record may not be incompetent, but it certainly won't be exceptional.\"\n\nAlbini also declined royalties for producing and mixing the album in his proposal, writing: \"I do not want and will not take a royalty on any record I record. No points. Period. I think paying a royalty to a producer or engineer is ethically indefensible. The band write the songs. The band play the music. It's the band's fans who buy the records. The band is responsible for whether it's a great record or a horrible record. Royalties belong to the band.\"\n\n\"I would like to be paid like a plumber: I do the job and you pay me what it's worth. The record company will expect me to ask for a point or a point and a half. If we assume three million sales, that works out to 400,00 dollars or so. There's no fucking way I would ever take that much money. I wouldn't be able to sleep.\"\n\nAlbini fronted the likes of underground bands such as Shellac, Big Black, Rapeman and Flour. Besides 'In Utero', he was most well known for being the producer of major albums such as Pixies' 'Surfer Rosa', PJ Harvey's 'Rid of Me', Manic Street Preachers' 'Journal For Plague Lovers' and more.\n\nShellac recently announced 'To All Trains', their first album in 10 years which is set for release next week (May 17) and were preparing to embark on a tour.\n\nSpeaking to NME last year, Albini shared that being forever associated with Nirvana due to his work on their 1993 final album 'In Utero' was no albatross. \"It's totally normal, it's perfectly reasonable,\" the producer and audio engineer told NME. \"If you had never heard of me before and someone is trying to introduce me to you, they are going to name the famous records that I worked on - and 'In Utero' is the most famous.\"\n\nLast year, Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic spoke to NME and recalled working with the producer and how the band landed on the post-'Nevermind' sound of the record. \"Kurt was a fan of Albini,\" he said. \"I remember being in a tour van in 1989 and Kurt was listening to Pixies. He raised his finger and said, 'This shall be our snare sound!' He wanted to do it with Steve for a long time.\"\n\nKurt Cobain had been a known admirer of Albini's music before he worked with Nirvana, having been in attendance when his band Big Black played their last ever show in 1987. During the first session, he brought with him a piece of the guitar Albini had smashed during the gig.\n\nFollowing the news of Steve Albini's death, several musicians have paid tribute to the late musician, producer and engineer.

Here's a look at the stars we've lost so far in 2024, through April.\n\nSteve Albini, an acclaimed musician who helmed some of the most revered albums across America's alternative music scene, has died after suffering a heart attack at his recording studio. He was 61.\n\nStaff at the studio, Electrical Audio, have confirmed to Pitchfork that Albini died on Tuesday.\n\nThe late musician fronted bands such as Big Black, Rapeman and Shellac, while he also produced albums for the likes of Nirvana, Pixies, PJ Harvey, and Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.\n\nAlbini was heavily influenced by the punk movement during his younger years, and he ultimately founded his own music project called Big Black, firstly as a solo effort before it eventually became a quartet.\n\nThe group released their debut album, \"Atomizer\" in 1986, and they're now recognized as one of the most influential punk groups of the era.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nDespite this, the group split and in 1987, Albini formed a new band called Rapeman.\n\nAlbini then formed Shellac in 1992 alongside drummer Todd Trainer and bassist Bob Weston. Together, they released five albums and the group are actually scheduled to release their latest record, \"To All Trains,\" next week.\n\nAlbini is probably best know for producing the final studio album by Nirvana, \"In Utero,\" which was released in 1993.\n\nIn 1995, Albini established his own recording studio and he worked with several high-profile acts, including Joanna Newsom, Low, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Manic Street Preachers and Jarvis Cocker.\n\nAway from the music scene, Albini also enjoyed huge success as a poker player, winning two bracelets at World Series of Poker tournaments, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money.\n\nAlbini is survived by his wife, movie-maker Heather Whinna.\n\nPhotos: Notable deaths in 2024 Glynis Johns Adan Canto Bud Harrelson Dejan Milojevic Jack Burke Mary Weiss Norman Jewison Charles Osgood Melanie Safka Chita Rivera Carl Weathers Wayne Kramer Ian Lavender Toby Keith Henry Fambrough Bob Edwards Don Gullett Lefty Driesell Andreas Brehme Golden Richards Richard Lewis Nikolai Ryzhkov Brian Mulroney Akira Toriyama Iris Apfel Andy Russell Ed Ott Chris Mortensen Steve Lawrence Naomi Barber King Paul Alexander Thomas P.

The group was known for controversial lyrics ... and for choosing to use a drum machine over a drum kit. They released 2 studio albums before disbanding in 1987.\n\nDespite his disdain for the term producer, Albini went on to work on several high-profile albums, including the Pixies' 1988 album \"Surfer Rosa\" and Nirvana's 1993 \"In Utero\" album. He also recorded PJ Harvey's second studio album, \"Rid of Me,\" which also came out in 1993.\n\nHe famously rejected royalty payments ... asking for a flat fee in most cases -- often criticizing musicians for being in it for the money.\n\nAlbini went on to front another rock band, called Shellac ... releasing 5 albums over their tenure together. Shellac was set to release their 6th album next week ... it was their first album in a decade. They were also reportedly planning to tour the album later this year.\n\nElijah Wood paid tribute to the late music legend on X ... writing ... \"Ugh man, a heartbreaking loss of a legend. Love to his family and innumerable colleagues.\"\n\nMarc Maron expressed a similar sentiment, noting ... \"The great Steve Albini has died. He engineered some of the greatest albums of all time.

The recording studio legend engineered classic albums like Nirvana's In Utero and Pixies' Surfer Rosa and operated the Chicago studio Electrical Audio until his final years. The vocalist and guitarist was also an outspoken critic of musicians and others who participated in exploitative industry practices.\n\nStaff members at Albini's studio, which he founded in 1997, confirmed to multiple outlets that a heart attack caused the revered rock musician's death. He's survived by his wife, filmmaker Heather Whinna.\n\nAlbini, who preferred the title \"recording engineer\" over \"producer,\" was born in 1962 in Pasadena, California, and later raised in Missoula, Montana. As a teen, he played in local punk bands before moving to Chicago in the late '70s to attend Northwestern University. He graduated with a journalism degree and went on to write about Chicago's emerging punk scene, where he'd become a fixture for pushing the boundaries of post-punk and alternative rock.\n\nHe rose to fame in the early '80s as the frontman for the Chicago-based trio he created, Big Black, which released a string of EPs that displayed the punk band's seething signature guitar sound. The band, comprised of guitarist Santiago Durango and bassist Jeff Pezzati, released their debut album, Atomizer, in 1986, followed by their second project, Songs About F---ing, a year later, which marked their break up.\n\n\"The more time passes, the more correct I think that assessment was,\" Albini told The Guardian in 2023. \"The band had persisted in making this hideous music and proven that if you have a valid set of working principles, you can do it on your own terms and never have to kiss anybody's ass.\"\n\nFollowing Big Black's split, Albini went on to form the noise rock band Rapeman. The band released only one album in 1988, Two Nuns and a Pack Mule, before also breaking up. Albini's musical efforts then turned toward the studio, where he lent his production to other artists' music, such as Robert Plant, The Stooges, Cheap Trick, Chevelle, and Superchunk.\n\nBy the early '90s, Albini continued to produce and engineer albums for various artists, widening his acclaim as he formed the band Shellac with drummer Todd Trainer and bassist Bob Weston in 1992. The trio released five albums during their years-long run, with their last, titled To All Trains, set to drop on May 17. The album, which they originally planned to tour, marks their first studio album release since 2014's Dude Incredible.\n\nBy his count, Albini worked on over 2,000 albums for mainstream acts and other artists over the course of his lifetime. \"If you pace yourself, you don't really have to worry about [burning out],\" he told Rolling Stone in 2014.\n\n\"I tend not to work at excruciating volume, so my ears are not physically fatigued,\" he continued. \"My attention span could still be fatigued, but there are tricks to preserve that ... You have to focus your attention on the minute details now and again, but if you spend every second of the session gritting your teeth and staring at the speakers and concentrating intently on every single thing that happens, then you eventually burn out your attention span, and then you can't do any work whatsoever.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

indie scene in the 1980s and 90s, leading bands including Big Black and Shellac.\n\nHis influence was also heard on the several thousand albums he produced and engineered.\n\nThey included The Pixies' seminal LP Surfer Rosa and Nirvana's In Utero.\n\nKurt Cobain recruited Albini to record the 1993 follow-up to their hugely successful Nevermind after being impressed by his work with Big Black, The Pixies and The Breeders.\n\nHowever, Albini was originally no fan of Nirvana, believing them to be an unremarkable version of the Seattle sound.\n\nHe reportedly agreed to work with them because he felt sorry for them, believing they were at the mercy of their major record label, and wanted to give them a more abrasive sound.\n\nThe album's resulting raw feel did not impress the Geffen label, which insisted the singles Heart-Shaped Box and All Apologies were remixed.\n\nIn Utero went on to sell five million copies in the US alone, and Albini remarked: \"I like it far more than I thought I was going to.\"\n\nIn general, he disliked the title of producer, telling the Guardian last year he preferred to be credited as an engineer because he saw his role as recording a band and not shaping its sound.\n\nHe also declined to take royalties, charging only a flat fee because he considered it unethical to make money from an artist's work indefinitely.\n\nHe ran his own studio, Electrical Audio, in Chicago, and had been preparing for the release of Shellac's To All Trains, their first album since 2014, on 17 May.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

He was 61.\n\nAlbini's death was unexpected as he was preparing to tour as the frontman for the band Shellac. Shellac's first album in a decade, To All Trains, is scheduled for release next week.\n\nWhen asked how his career would be regarded if he ever retired, Albini recently told The Guardian: \"I don't give a shit. I'm doing it, and that's what matters to me -- the fact that I get to keep doing it. That's the whole basis of it. I was doing it yesterday, and I'm gonna do it tomorrow, and I'm gonna carry on doing it.\"\n\nAlbini was also an advocate for the Covid vaccine.\n\nPitchfork noted: \"Albini was a legend of the recording studio, though he preferred the term 'engineer' to 'producer.' He recorded Nirvana's In Utero, Pixies' Surfer Rosa, PJ Harvey's Rid of Me, and countless more classic albums, and remained an outspoken critic of exploitative music industry practices.\"\n\nAlbini was a controversial figure as Pitchfork noted he was linked to provocative band names (Rapeman, Run N***er Run), song titles ( \"Pray I Don't Kill You F***ot,\" \"My Black Ass\"), and offhand statements (\"I want to strangle Odd Future\"). While he refused to apologize for his choice in names and jokes, in Michael Azerrad's 2001 book Our Band Could Be Your Life, Albini made it clear that he believed his real stances on race, gender, LGBTQ rights, and politics were obvious. \"I have less respect for the man who bullies his girlfriend and calls her 'Ms' than a guy who treats women reasonably and respectfully and calls them 'Yo! Bitch,'\" Albini told Azerrad. \"The point of all this is to change the way you live your life, not the way you speak.\"\n\nLater in life, Pitchfork noted, Albini repeatedly apologized for his past controversies, realizing that intent and moral clarity went only so far.\n\n\"A lot of things I said and did from an ignorant position of comfort and privilege are clearly awful and I regret them. It's nobody's obligation to overlook that, and I do feel an obligation to redeem myself,\" Albini wrote on X in 2021. \"If anything, we were trying to underscore the banality, the everyday nonchalance toward our common history with the atrocious, all while laboring under the tacit *mistaken* notion that things were getting better. I'm overdue for a conversation about my role in inspiring 'edgelord' shit.

But you've almost certainly heard his work.\n\nAlbini, a musician, producer and revered audio engineer who worked with countless alternative rock bands and artists, including Nirvana, Pixies and PJ Harvey, died Tuesday of a heart attack. He was 61.\n\nThe Chicago-based Albini was also the frontman for the underground rock groups Big Black and Shellac, which was preparing to release its first new album in nearly a decade on May 17.\n\nAlbini was perhaps best known as the engineer behind Nirvana's third studio album, 1993's In Utero. But he produced or recorded literally hundreds of others.\n\nHere are just some of the best from Albini's extensive discography.\n\nThe Pixies' seminal debut record is arguably Albini's greatest album, and was later cited as an influence by rock icons including Billy Corgan, PJ Harvey and Kurt Cobain.\n\nCobain said the debut studio album by the Breeders, fronted by Pixies bassist Kim Deal, was one of his favorite records -- and the reason he tapped Albini for In Utero.\n\nLike Cobain, Harvey was a big fan of Albini's work with the Breeders and Pixies, and it culminated in the raw immediacy of this critically acclaimed album.\n\nTweez, recorded by Albini in Evanston, Ill., was Slint's first album and the only one released before their disbandment.\n\nThe ubiquitous Australian backing band for indie stalwarts Cat Power and Smog was captured by Albini as a formidable post-rock trio of its own.\n\nThis slow burning alt-country rock album would be the last led by Jason Molina as Songs: Ohia, and a launchpad for Molina's next band, Magnolia Electric Co.\n\nThe eponymous debut LP from the garage rock musician Ty Segall has all the hallmarks of an Albini classic: crackling distortion, lo-fi production and raw energy.\n\nThe sophomore album by the harpist-vocalist features orchestral folk arrangements unlike anything in Albini's catalog.\n\nThe debut album by Albini's long-running indie trio Shellac is still revered by fans as one of his best.\n\nThe second and final studio album by Albini-fronted punk rockers Big Black features covers of Kraftwerk and Cheap Trick alongside 12 originals.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org",

His passing was confirmed to Pitchfork by the staff at his studio, Electric Audio.\n\nAlbini worked on an incredible number of beloved rock albums, including Nirvana's In Utero, The Breeders' Pod, Pixies' Surfer Rosa, PJ Harvey's Rid of Me, and Low's Things We Lost in the Fire among many others. He also produced Bush's 1996 album Razorblade Suitcase, with frontman Gavin Rossdale recalling, \"to me he was the king of the underground.\"\n\nAlbini was also the frontman of the group Shellac, whose first album in a decade, To All Trains, was scheduled for release next week. The group were in the midst of preparing for a tour.\n\nAlbini was born in Pasadena, California, and first started playing bass while recovering from a broken leg in his youth. He grew up inspired by groups like the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, Pere Ubu, and Devo, and began playing in bands in high school. He went on to get his degree in journalism from Northwestern University and began covering the Chicago punk-rock scene for local zines.\n\nAround the same time, Albini recorded the first EP for his DIY group, Big Black, which would kickstart his career as a recording engineer. He often said he preferred the term 'engineer' to 'producer,' as he felt his job was to record the band, not shape their sound. He also didn't take royalties on the records he engineered, opting instead for a flat fee due to his belief that it is unethical to make money off an artist's work indefinitely.\n\nAs Albini gained fame in the music world, he also became known for his incendiary statements and abrasive attitude. In recent years, he expressed regret in regards to his past: \"A lot of things I said and did from an ignorant position of comfort and privilege are clearly awful and I regret them,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn spite of it all, Albini's love of music never changed. \"My essential relationship with music is that I am a fan of it,\" he told Fevers of the Mind in 2023. \"Everything else has grown out of that, and despite being battered with music all day every day, I still find things that surprise and delight me, and I still want to play guitar in a band.\"", "source": {"uri":

Here's a look at the stars we've lost so far in 2024, through April.\n\nSteve Albini, an acclaimed musician who helmed some of the most revered albums across America's alternative music scene, has died after suffering a heart attack at his recording studio. He was 61.\n\nStaff at the studio, Electrical Audio, have confirmed to Pitchfork that Albini died on Tuesday.\n\nThe late musician fronted bands such as Big Black, Rapeman and Shellac, while he also produced albums for the likes of Nirvana, Pixies, PJ Harvey, and Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.\n\nAlbini was heavily influenced by the punk movement during his younger years, and he ultimately founded his own music project called Big Black, firstly as a solo effort before it eventually became a quartet.\n\nThe group released their debut album, \"Atomizer\" in 1986, and they're now recognized as one of the most influential punk groups of the era.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nDespite this, the group split and in 1987, Albini formed a new band called Rapeman.\n\nAlbini then formed Shellac in 1992 alongside drummer Todd Trainer and bassist Bob Weston. Together, they released five albums and the group are actually scheduled to release their latest record, \"To All Trains,\" next week.\n\nAlbini is probably best know for producing the final studio album by Nirvana, \"In Utero,\" which was released in 1993.\n\nIn 1995, Albini established his own recording studio and he worked with several high-profile acts, including Joanna Newsom, Low, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Manic Street Preachers and Jarvis Cocker.\n\nAway from the music scene, Albini also enjoyed huge success as a poker player, winning two bracelets at World Series of Poker tournaments, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money.\n\nAlbini is survived by his wife, movie-maker Heather Whinna.\n\nPhotos: Notable deaths in 2024 Glynis Johns Adan Canto Bud Harrelson Dejan Milojevic Jack Burke Mary Weiss Norman Jewison Charles Osgood Melanie Safka Chita Rivera Carl Weathers Wayne Kramer Ian Lavender Toby Keith Henry Fambrough Bob Edwards Don Gullett Lefty Driesell Andreas Brehme Golden Richards Richard Lewis Nikolai Ryzhkov Brian Mulroney Akira Toriyama Iris Apfel Andy Russell Ed Ott Chris Mortensen Steve Lawrence Naomi Barber King Paul Alexander Thomas P.

Maybe in the next few days we could talk about his impact which was immense,\" Fox said in an email.\n\nAlbini's death came little more than a week before his longtime band Shellac was set to release a new album To All Trains on May 17. It will be the band's first album since 2014.\n\nFirst developing an interest in punk after being introduced to the Ramones as a teen, Albini voraciously consumed all the new music he could find growing up in his hometown of Missoula, Montana, and played in his earliest music projects. After graduating high school, he moved to Evanston, Illinois, to attend journalism school at Northwestern University, immersing himself in the scene as a fan and a writer for local music magazines.\n\nAlbini began his music career in 1981, when he formed the punk rock band Big Black while a student at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University.\n\nHe later went on to form two other bands, the controversially named Rapeman and Shellac, with the latter the longest-existing and arguably the most important band of his career as a performer. For Shellac, he performed vocals and guitar alongside bassist Bob Weston and drummer Todd Trainer.\n\nHe also helped record and track some of the most influential albums of the alternative rock era in the 1980s and 1990s, including Nirvana's \"In Utero,\" Pixies' \"Surfer Rosa,\" PJ Harvey's \"Rid of Me,\" Veruca Salt's EP \"Blow It Out Your Ass It's Veruca Salt,\" and multiple albums for Urge

The first time I met him was about 30 years ago. I was a graduate student at Northwestern University and assigned to interview somebody, and I had just bought \"In Utero,\" Nirvana's follow-up to its blockbuster album \"Nevermind.\" Albini was the producer of \"In Utero,\" and one of my favorite albums, the Pixies' \"Surfer Rosa,\" and so I called him, he agreed to chat, and while I remember little of what he said, I remember we talked for hours.\n\nHe had studied journalism himself at Northwestern, so he was generous. He had endless opinions on culture and music and what it means to stand by your convictions. I remember at point simply asking what a record producer did. He said he wasn't a record producer, he was a record engineer. I asked what that was, and he said it was like a record producer.\n\nA year ago, the last time I spoke to him, I asked about his first concert, and he replied as he replied to everything, with too much knowledge and detail and an opinion so insightful and provocative and hilarious that it sucked the air from the room. The concert was the Edgar Winter Group, Sept. 27, 1975, Montana, where he lived as a teenager. He recalled his father saying people only went to rock shows to buy drugs. He recalled, as Edgar Winter launched into a 20-minute keyboard solo, the \"dead-eyed gaze\" of Johnny Winter \"navigating solo breaks in this tumultuous excess, like Ahab resigned to his fate in a dinghy, tossed by the sea and pernicious corpus of his brother's prog rock white whale ...\" He didn't know if the concert itself was exactly a good idea, but: \"An impressionable young Steve thanks whoever set it up for those enduring images of madness and futility.\"\n\nAlbini talked like that.\n\nHe was an intimidating guy, and eventually, a sweet guy. He was, as kids say these days, a \"gatekeeper,\" the prototypical record store owner who frowns at what you bring to his cash register - though he made records, he didn't sell them. The day after he died, the satirical website Hard Times posted this headline: \"Steve Albini standing outside gates of Heaven telling everyone how much he hates the Smashing Pumpkins.\"\n\nHe could go off on corporate culture and its deadening effects on artists and consumers (and did so elegantly at times, for literary journals like the Hyde Park-based Baffler). He produced famous records and made lesser-known ones with his bands Big Black and Shellac, but also became, by dint of his taste, a sought-after totem of cultural integrity - a representative of a way of being. Or as comedian Fred Armisen told this newspaper several years ago: \"Steve Albini became a huge influence on me, which I don't know if he knows. He had this philosophy on how to live and be and gave me advice I still keep in mind.\" As for Albini, he always kept it blunt: \"I wasn't a fan of Trenchmouth (Armisen's Chicago-based punk band) - and so that's not why we would have become friends.\"\n\nHe was vintage Gen X sarcastic, ironic, contrarian, defiantly principled. One of the best things ever written on music was Albini's 1993 essay \"The Problem With Music\" for the Baffler, in which he laid out finances, empty promises, unnecessary flourishes. It opens with quite the metaphor: a band (\"some of them good friends, some of them barely acquaintances\") standing at one end of a trench filled with waste and at the other end is a music industry \"lackey\" with a fountain pen and contract. Whoever swims the trench first will get the deal. Only then, the industry insists: \"Swim it again, please. Backstroke.\"\n\nThomas Frank, the founder of the Baffler, told me in an email that he never knew Albini personally, but that essay for the journal would become its \"consummate expression\": \"Seeing through the falsehoods of the culture industry was the first order of business, and no one was better at it than Steve Albini.\"\n\nBy credits alone, Albini became not only a glue stick of underground music, and a major influence around the country as Wicker Park became an early '90s music mecca, but a tastemaker for what was once called college radio music and later rebranded \"alt rock.\"\n\nHe held it to ideals that no popular cultural business could entirely satisfy.\n\nHe recorded a who's who of '90s Chicago bands (including Urge Overkill, Veruca Salt and Jesus Lizard); alt superstars (PJ Harvey, Bush); and the occasional icon (Robert Plant and Jimmy Page, the Stooges, Cheap Trick). He became known for applying loving sonic care to acts best known by their fields of distortion. He captured, as the cliche went, how a performer sounded live. But attaining clarity, power and honesty seemed deceptively easy. As Albini told Chicago magazine in 1997: \"I honestly just feel that music like this deserves to be taken seriously. And that means people who record them should be as concerned about quality as if they were recording the (expletive) Chicago symphony.\"\n\nYet, at the peak of his influence, he also said: \"If you wanted to take punk seriously on a more significant level, you could. If you pretend to take dance music seriously on a more significant level, that is a delusional pretension. There really is no substance to it.\"\n\nRick Nielsen of Cheap Trick said they first met in the late 1970s. A teenage Albini sold him a guitar. Nielsen's son Miles, now of the Rockford-based band Rusted Hearts, even helped Albini physically build his Electrical Audio studio in Avondale. When Albini later produced Cheap Trick, he was \"a stickler, but excellent,\" Nielsen said. He had \"this reputation as a tough guy,\" though Nielsen suspects \"a lot of it came from record execs because Steve was so different. He was the most honest person in the music business.\n\n\"And that's a list without a lot of company.\"\n\nStill, as Albini got older, he came to regret some of the hard-line things he spouted. (He once wrote for a music zine that the Replacements' breakthrough \"Let It Be\" was a \"sad, pathetic end to a long downhill slide.\") Michael Azerrad, biographer of Nirvana and author of \"Our Band Could Be Your Life,\" posted Wednesday on X that Albini \"was a great artist and underwent the most remarkable and inspiring personal transformation.\" With years came warmth, pleasantness. He faced his incendiary urges. After all, here was a man who once, for a Northwestern art class, invited 100 of his enemies to throw stuff at him as he swore at them behind Plexiglass.\n\nPeople threw dog poop, bricks, bowling pins.\n\nMartin Atkins, former drummer of Public Image Ltd., a Pilsen resident and industrial mainstay with bands such as Pigface, Nine Inch Nails and Killing Joke, recorded with Albini for years. \"We would argue,\" he said. \"He didn't like the idea that Pigface was touring in a bus. He would say, 'Oh, what a bunch of (expletive) rock stars!' And I would go, \"Steve, there are 16 of us! What would you want us to do - tour in five mini-vans?\n\n\"I remember in Minnesota, coming back from one of his favorite studios, he agreed to drive me to the airport and we argued music for so long that he drove 40 minutes past the airport and I missed my flight. Things were often very cut and dry to Steve, but always centered on the glorious movement of sound. Whatever personal, spiritual, creative problems he might have had, he worked hard to clear them out to get you your sound.\"\n\nIndeed, of all the legendary tales of Steve Albini, one of the best is the long letter that he wrote to Nirvana before recording \"In Utero,\" to lay out his philosophy and expectations:\n\n\"I do not want and will not take a royalty on any record I record. ... I think paying a royalty to a producer or engineer is ethically indefensible. ... I would like to be paid like a plumber: I do the job and you pay me what it's worth. The record company will expect me to ask for a point or a point and a half. If we assume three million sales, that works out to 400,000 dollars or so. There's no (expletive) way I would ever take that much money. I wouldn't be able to sleep.\"\n\nNirvana, eager to retain a shred of indie cred after becoming the biggest band in the world, was a natural fit with Albini. The problem was, after they made \"In Utero,\" the record company hated its sound; the band itself began airing doubts. And so, before release, changes were made. Moreover, Albini's reputation as a pedantic, prickly and iconoclastic collaborator, quick to question someone's ideology, caught up to him.\n\nHe told interviewers major labels didn't want to work with him; critics accused him of selling out by working with them at all, then being fast to complain if it went badly.\n\nBut as goofy as it sounds now, since that concept has lost its meaning: He never could sell out. Not the way we assume artists inevitably do. He retained a pure righteous punk intention, except when astringent logic failed. Talking about his young, uncompromising self, he gave himself little room to hide. Last year he told the Guardian newspaper: \"The one thing I don't want to do is say: 'The culture shifted - excuse my behavior.' It provides a context for why I was wrong at the time, but I was wrong at the time.\"\n\nIn an Instagram post on Wednesday, Armisen said that just the other day Albini had texted him about cymbals. He didn't get cymbals: \"Like I can tell the difference between this one and that one but if I'm honest they both sound like cymbals and I don't care.\"\n\nArmisen concluded: \"I always loved hearing him say 'I don't care.'\"", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

According to a staff member at Albini's Electric Audio Recordings studio in Chicago, Albini died of a heart attack on Tuesday night (May 7).\n\nThough he disdained the term \"producer,\" preferring \"engineer\" instead, Albini said in a 2018 interview that worked on more than 2,000 albums, mostly for underground or indie bands, but also notably on projects by two of the most important and influential bands of the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nIn addition to recording Nirvana's final full studio album, 1993's In Utero, he also worked on the beloved 1988 album Surfer Rosa by one of late Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain's favorite bands, the Pixies. Constantly toggling between albums by A-list major label acts (PJ Harvey's lashing 1993 album Rid of Me, Bush's Razorblade Suitcase) and beloved indie bands from his native Chicago (Urge Overkill, The Jesus Lizard, Tar), Albini was also a prolific musicians in his own right with a series of hardcore and noise bands, including Big Black, Rapeman and Shellac.\n\nBorn in Pasadena, Calif. on July 22, 1962, Albini positioned himself as a staunch outsider in the mainstream music industry, which he considered exploitative, refusing to accept the traditional producer royalties for any of the albums he recorded at his Chicago studio.\n\nShellac were poised to release their first album in a decade, To All Trains, next week, and had booked a series of shows in England in June, followed by a run of U.S. dates in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles in July.\n\nOften working on dozens of albums per year, Albini kept up his torrid pace recently, re-teaming with frequent collaborator folk singer Nina Nastasia in 2022, as well as working on albums by Black Midi, Spare Snare, Liturgy and Code Orange over the past two years.", "source": {"uri": "billboard.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

To view a copy of this license, visit https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/?ref=openverse.\n\nToday, the music world mourns the loss of Steve Albini, who passed away suddenly from a heart attack on Tuesday, May 7. As a performer, engineer, organizer, and champion for the underground, Albini was a crucial figurehead in the formation of the alternative rock scene, lending his expertise to uplift such legends as Nirvana, Pixies, PJ Harvey, the Jesus Lizard and many more. Through his career, the artist attained a reputation as a staunchly opinionated advocate for music, whose razor-sharp commentary on the recording industry proved prophetic and came to shape the ideologies of multiple generations of artists and fans. He was 61.\n\nBorn in Pasadena, Calif., Albini spent much of his early years moving from home to home before coming of age in Missoula, Montana. In his early teens, the artist's life was forever changed by contact with the music of the Ramones; shocked and amazed by the group's do-it-yourself ethos and unrepentant attitude, Albini would go on to credit the whole of his music career to that formative encounter with the group's first album, which spurred his rapid immersion into his local punk scene. Albini later received a degree in journalism from Northwestern University, which he put to use immediately through notoriously witty and rabid scrawls for local punk zines in his new home of Chicago, where he found a scene that \"enabled [him] to continue on with a life in music,\" as told to NPR.\n\nAlbini found his break into the music industry in 1981 with the formation of Big Black, which became a repository for every last drop of his creativity, commentary and conscience. While he initially recorded each part solo atop a Roland TR-606, he soon found likeminded collaborators in Jeff Pezzati and Santiago Durango of Naked Raygun, and later drummer Pat Byrne. After swapping in Dave Riley for Pezzatti, the band delivered the unforgettable albums Atomizer and Songs About Fucking, which blew the lif off a new strain off punk with their whirring chainsaw guitars, syncopated, synthetic percussive chop and snarling, unrestrained lyrics, heard on such tracks as \"Kerosene\" and \"Bad Penny.\"\n\nShortly after Big Black, Albini moved on to form Shellac in 1990, which honed the chaos of his previous work to a fine point and produced some of the most iconic projects of the post-hardcore era with 1994's At Action Park, 1998's Terraform, 2000's Excellent Italian Grayhound and 2014's Dude Incredible. This month, Shellac were preparing to travel with To All Trains, the band's first album in a decade, which is slated for release next week.\n\nAlbini routinely refused the title producer, for its connotations of exerting commanding influence over the material at hand. With that caveat, he gave his efforts tirelessly to supporting the works of other artists, serving as a recording engineer for an estimated several thousand albums issued from the underground that gave voice to generation after generation of dissidents, pathbreakers, and sonic revolutionaries. Albini became highly regarded and demanded for his analog-purist production style, creating classic and exacting deliveries of his collaborators' messages, free from frills and distractions and favoring unwavering directness. Among his most renowned creations are Nirvana's In Utero, Pixies' Surfer Rosa, PJ Harvey's Rid of Me, The Breeders' Pod, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's self-titled, Palace Music's Viva Last Blues and many, many more. In all, Albini's staggering canon earned him regard not only as the definitive creator of some of the most striking and distinctive moments in rock, but as one of the greatest engineers of all time.\n\nSteve Albini lives on in the canon of music's most important innovators. He was unrelenting iconoclast and idealist who made his vision for the future manifest in frenetic fits and spurts, channeling his inexhaustible creative energy into music, criticism, collaboration and clear-headed guidance for up-and-comers. He was respected both for the boldness of his thoughts and actions and his willingness to reevaluate his perspective and move through the world with the best interests of his community at heart. His life and career have been an inspiration to innumerable successors, and he lives on in the indelible mark he left on the world of music.", "source": {"uri": "relix.com", "dataType": "news",

He also produced -- or, in his preferred term, engineered -- albums for numerous artists including Nirvana, Pixies, PJ Harvey, and Page and Plant. He maintained a strong DIY and punk ethos, resisting streaming services and refusing to take royalties for music he produced.\n\nHailing from Pasadena, California, Albini's family led a nomadic existence during the first few years of his life before settling in Missoula, Montana. It was during his teenage years that he began to shape his identity through music after discovering the Ramones. He went on to study journalism in Illinois, where he became involved in the Chicago punk scene.\n\n\"It was an extremely active, very fertile scene where everybody was participating on every level,\" Albini said during a 2023 NPR interview while commenting on Chicago's music scene. \"The community that I joined when I came to Chicago enabled me to continue on with a life in music. I didn't do this by myself.\"\n\nAlbini started recording with Big Black in the early 1980s before going on to form Rapeman and then Shellac in the early 1990s with Bob Weston and Todd Trainer. They released several EPs and five albums.\n\nThroughout his career, Albini was known for his work principles and skepticism of the music industry. He refused to accept royalties for his work, even on acclaimed albums like Nirvana's \"In Utero.\"\n\nAdditionally, he was a celebrated poker player, winning two prized bracelets at World Series of Poker events and raking in hundreds of thousands of dollars in winnings.\n\nRemembering Albini, David Grubbs, whose band Gastr del Sol worked with the producer, summed him up as \"a brilliant, infinitely generous person, absolutely one-of-a-kind, and so inspiring to see him change over time and own up to things he outgrew,\" according to The Guardian.\n\nZoe Papadakis \u2709\n\nZoe Papadakis is a Newsmax writer based in South Africa with two decades of experience specializing in media and entertainment.

Harvey, has died. He was 61 years old.\n\nAlbini, who also performed as a punk rock musician in the noise and post-punk bands Big Black, which he fronted, and Shellac, died of a heart attack, the staff of his recording studio, Electric Audio, confirmed to Pitchfork.\n\nIn addition to running the state-of-the-art studio Electric Audio in Chicago, for affordable prices for many independent musicians, Albini also held unique business practices in the music industry, refusing to take royalties on artists' recordings as is standard practice for engineers and producers.\n\n\"The session I did with Nirvana was conducted under essentially the same terms I'd do with any band, then or now: we'll figure out how much it's worth to do the session, you pay me, and Bob's your uncle,\" Albini explained in a 2014 documentary.\n\nWithin the music industry, my business practices are somewhat unusual. Normally, bands would be paying a royalty to the producer or engineer ... from an ethical standpoint I believe it is an untenable position for me to say, to a band, 'I'm gonna work for you for a couple of weeks and then for the rest of your f****** lives you're gonna pay me a tribute.\n\nAlbini's model -- which he compared to building a house, and not charging homeowners for the construction for years to come -- and his ear for a raw yet refined way to present the bands on recordings led to him becoming one of the most prolific and sought-after producers of the 1990s.\n\nHis work as the engineer on the Pixies' \"Surfer Rosa\" album put him on the map for many, but his signature on Nirvana's final studio album \"In Utero\" would make him a household name in the alternative music wave of the 1990s. He would form long-standing partnerships with groups like The Jesus Lizard and Pixies while also working with popular bands of the time like Bush but also pairing up with icons of the Chicago and Midwest rock world like Cheap Trick and The Stooges.\n\nHis sudden passing sent waves of grief and shock through the music landscape.\n\n\"Unquestionably a giant of American indie rock, he seemed to be in the midst of a personal & professional renaissance,\" music critic Steven Hyden wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter. \"He was always interesting, even when he was maddening. And his drum sound is one of the greatest in recorded music\"\n\n\"Steve Albini did more to shape music as we know it in his 61 years on earth than most people could ever dream to across multiple lifetimes,\" the musician and indie label runner Max Allison wrote. \"standards we take for granted now came into the culture by his mind & his hands. he taught generations how to make art your life's work.\"", "source": {"uri": "abc7amarillo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KVII"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jackson_sinnenberg@abc7amarillo.com", "name": "Jackson Sinnenberg", "type": "author",

He once fronted a band named Run N****r Run who had a single called 'Pray I Don't Kill You, Faggot', frequently acted in the persona of a child being raped while performing his song 'Jordan, Minnesota' and said of Illinois rock band Poster Children \"they had a really fruity drummer for a while, but I think he died of the syph\".\n\nThen there was his infamous letter to the Chicago Reader entitled 'Three Pandering Sluts and their Music Press Stooge', in which he excoriated critic Bill Wyman for his yearly top 10 and memorably signed off \"Shame on your lazy head. Clip your year-end column and put it away for ten years. See if you don't feel like an idiot when you reread it. F*** you.\"\n\nAlbini described pop music as \"for children and idiots\", Courtney Love as \"a psycho hose beast\" and of electronic music he said \"I detest club culture as deeply as I detest anything on earth\". So yeah, he could be a bit of a dick.\n\nRead More:\n\nThis is not to rake over old ground in an attempt at some posthumous cancellation - it was something to which he readily admitted in later years. In a 2021 Twitter thread he copped to the fact \"I'm overdue for a conversation about my role in inspiring 'edgelord shit'\" and in a full-on mea culpa said \"a lot of things I said and did from an ignorant position of comfort and privilege are clearly awful and I regret them\". Had he gone woke? Albini said: \"however you define 'woke', anti-woke means being a c*** who wants to indulge bigots\".\n\nAlbini was, in the truest sense of the word, a punk. He credited his entire career to having heard the first Ramones album as a teenager, and achieved underground success with bands of his own including Big Black and, er, Rapeman (he would later liken this name to getting a bad tattoo). He also took the punk ethos into his better known work as a producer, preferring to receive no credit on album sleeves or notes, charging a flat rate for his work and taking no royalties as he considered it \"unethical\" to make money from a band or artist in perpetuity.\n\nAs has been noted since his death, he worked on some of the best and most influential music of the late 80s and early 90s, notably Surfer Rosa, the 1988 debut studio album by Pixies. Recorded over 10 days, Albini found the acoustics in Q Division problematic and famously recorded Kim Deal's vocals on hit single 'Where Is My Mind?' in the studio bathroom to create a more \"roomy echo\".\n\nThe album was released to critical acclaim and frequently features on all-time best lists, though in a 1994 interview with Forced Exposure its producer dismissed it as \"patchwork pinch-loaf from a band who at their top dollar best are blandly entertaining college rock\". He later apologised, saying he was \"ashamed\" of the comments.\n\nAlbini would go on to produce critically acclaimed albums for the likes of PJ Harvey and The Jesus Lizard, but is probably most widely remembered for his work on In Utero, Nirvana's third and final studio album.\n\nKurt Cobain had cited Surfer Rosa as the basis for his band's sound, making him a logical choice to produce the follow-up to the multi-platinum Nevermind - in the band's eyes at least.\n\nCobain was looking for a more abrasive sound on In Utero, which famously opens with the line: \"teenage angst has paid off well, now I'm bored and old\". The sessions took just 13 days, with Albini producing a final mix in a further five.\n\nWhen the masters were sent to the label, however, the feedback was not good. Geffen had not wanted the band to work with Albini and In Utero was dismissed as \"unlistenable\".\n\nAfter a very public back-and-forth during which Albini refused to re-mix the record and told the Chicago Tribune he thought it would never be released, In Utero was subject to some remastering and unleashed on the world.\n\nContemporary reaction was mixed. NME called it \"neither totally a self-destructive squall of hardcore nihilism as originally rumoured, nor the 'Nevermind II' of more recent whispers\", Rolling Stone called it \"brilliant, corrosive, enraged and thoughtful\" and Plugged In dismissed it as \"noxious noise with no value\".\n\nAlbini and Nirvana had the last laugh, with In Utero frequently cited as one of the best rock albums ever made.\n\nThough he complained that the wrangle over its release led to him being dismissed by labels in the aftermath of the album, Albini brought his signature style to work by Mogwai, Joanna Newsom, the Stooges and Cheap Trick. When the Manic Street Preachers wanted to bring the late Richey Edwards' left-behind lyrics to life on Journal for Plague Lovers it was Albini to whom they turned.\n\nHis own band, Shellac, released a string of albums between 1993 and 2019, with the latest To All Trains completed shortly before Albini's death.\n\nWhile that will be read by some as his last will and testament, perhaps more appropriate would be his final musing on social media: \"The Rolling Stones lips but it's a butthole. Do they still sue people? I have an idea...\"", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shame_(band)", "type":

(And he preferred being called an engineer, not a producer, he'd remind you.) He was also a great musician, a great poker player, and, by all accounts, a pretty loyal friend. But Albini also became well-known for his biting wit, which could cut a beloved band, political movement, or Las Vegas concert venue clear down to the quick in just a single sentence. For years, he took no prisoners, even shitting on bands he'd worked with loudly in the press, a move that led to Chunklet magazine naming him one of the \"100 biggest assholes in rock.\"\n\nAnd while Albini walked back some of his fight-picking in recent years, which he explained in this excellent Guardian profile from last year, he still held at least some vitriol for ticket fees, eclipse fans, and people who think Pearl Jam has ever made a perfect record. Below, you'll find an annotated selection of some of Albini's killer witticisms from over the years, all in his memory. The world will be worse now without Albini around to hold us all to account.\n\nWhen Nirvana went to make In Utero, they wanted to hire Albini, in part because they were such big fans of his work with the Jesus Lizard. After a phone call between Albini and Kurt Cobain, the engineer wrote a letter to the band proposing how he'd make the record, explaining everything from what studio he'd like to use to his overall philosophy of engineering. He also went into his absolute refusal to take \"points,\" or a percentage of sales, on the record, writing, \"I think paying a royalty to a producer or engineer is ethically indefensible,\" and adding, \"I would like to be paid like a plumber: I do the job and you pay me what it's worth. The record company will expect me to ask for a point or a point and a half. If we assume 3 million sales, that works out to 400,000 dollars or so. There's no fucking way I would ever take that much money. I wouldn't be able to sleep.\"\n\nAfter signing the four-page letter, Albini ended it with that above postscript, as well as with an \"Oi!,\" reiterating his punk bona fides with just 14 short words.\n\nWhile fans hail Albini's work with bands like the Pixies, that doesn't mean he always made the best impression on the actual bands. After recording the Pixies' Surfer Rosa in 1988 for just $1,500, he went on to roundly shit on the band in the press, telling Forced Exposure in 1991 that the Pixies record he just finished is \"a patchwork pinch loaf from a band who at their top-dollar best are blandly entertaining college rocks,\" adding: \"Their willingness to be guided by their manager, their record company, and their producers is unparalleled. Never have I seen four cows more anxious to be led around by their nose rings.\"\n\nIt's a pretty low blow, considering Albini even admits in the story that he thought Surfer Rosa was \"pretty good at the time\" he was helping make it. His turn could be explained by the the band's label, Elektra, bringing him back into the fold a couple of years later, when the band needed to record a one-off track for a label compilation. In the Forced Exposure piece, Albini said, \"The band had been getting the Big High Building 'pampered performer' treatment for a couple of years by then and were consequently bored and dour,\" and detailed how the Elektra even sent him a fancy engraved Omega watch after the fact. \"As soon as somebody at the pool room offers me what it's worth,\" he said, \"I'm going to have a hell of a nice dinner.\"\n\nTo Albini's credit, he owned up to his harshness decades later, saying in the press that he regretted what he'd said about the band and even becoming good friends with the group's Kim Deal. When news about Albini's death broke, Deal's other group, the Breeders, posted that they were mourning their former producer and friend, saying, \"He built worlds.\" The Pixies, on the other hand, posted a very succinct \"RIP Steve Albini.\"\n\nIn 1993, Albini wrote a long piece for The Baffler called \"The Problem With Music.\" It's well worth a read, especially if you're interested in the economics of being in a mildly successful band, which really haven't changed all that much in the past 30 years. It's also chock-full of Albini-isms, from why he thinks producers should stop trying to make bands sound like the Beatles (\"Fuck's sake, Thurston Moore is not Paul McCartney, and nobody on Earth, not with unlimited time and resources, could make the Smashing Pumpkins sound like the Beatles. Trying just makes them seem even dumber.\") to why it's bullshit that everyone with a little bit of knowledge is called a \"producer\" now.\n\nHe also gets into the nitty-gritty of being an engineer, the pros and cons of different recording equipment, and why he hates \"trendy electronics and other flashy shit that nobody really needs.\" Albini was a fan of analog recording and kept his studio full of equipment that he deemed acceptable, from microphones to aluminum guitars. Tube limiters -- which attenuate the dynamic range of a sound -- were absolutely not permitted.\n\nThere are few bands Albini seemed to hate more than Steely Dan, whom he often colorfully shit on in interviews and on his X and Bluesky accounts. \"Christ the amount of human effort wasted to sound like an SNL band warm up,\" he wrote in February 2023, following it up with, \"Look at yourselves. Calling them 'the Dan.' Go trim your beard.\" He described an interview he saw with Donald Fagen in which the Steely Dan member said he was inspired by his \"deep love of the blues\" and then laid what Albini called \"his jazz dork hands on the fucking electric piano.\"\n\nAlbini then landed the plane by delivering the line above about wedding bands and conceding that he does actually kind of like Boz Scaggs, even though, like Steely Dan, he thinks Scaggs makes \"cocaine shit music.\" Touch\u00e9, good sir. Touch\u00e9.\n\nOne of Albini's most storied rants was a 1994 letter he wrote to the Chicago Reader, the local alt-weekly, which is titled \"Three Pandering Sluts and Their Music-Press Stooge.\" In the letter, which is addressed to esteemed music critic Bill Wyman, Albini calls Liz Phair \"a fucking chore to listen to,\" says the Smashing Pumpkins are \"ultimately insignificant,\" and calls Urge Overkill \"wieners in suits playing frat party rock,\" ultimately signing the letter with a simple \"fuck you.\"\n\nCritics are only writing about the above bands, he says, because some music-publicity machine told them to, saying, \"Watching the three artists you moo about prostrate themselves before the altar of publicity these last 12 months has been a source of unrivaled hilarity here in the 'bullshit' camp, and seeing them sink into the obscurity they have earned by blowing their promo wads will be equally satisfying.\"\n\nWhen Diagonal label boss Oscar Powell e-mailed Albini if he could use a decades-old sample of his voice on a track by his band, Powell, he probably just expected a simple yes or no. Instead, he got a long reply from Albini detailing how much he hates dance music and club culture, with lines like, \"I've always detested mechanized dance music, its stupid simplicity, the clubs where it was played, the people who went to those clubs, the drugs they took, the shit they liked to talk about, the clothes they wore, the battles they fought amongst each other ... Basically all of it: 100 percent hated every scrap.\" Still, he concludes, Powell can use the sample. As he explains, \"I am against what you're into, and an enemy of where you come from but I have no problem with what you're doing ...\"\n\nWhen asked about the exchange by Marc Maron on an episode of the WTF podcast, Albini even went so far as to double down, explaining that in his mind and at least when it comes to disco, \"When you see these mustached schmucks in their silk shirts, it's easy to be offended by that culturally without being offended by the gay and soul-music roots.\"\n\nThere was no love lost between Albini and Amanda Palmer in 2012, when the Dresden Dolls front woman was in the midst of asking her fans to not only fund her new record via Kickstarter, but also the string quartet and horn section she said she needed for her tour. (She raised more than $1.2 million on the album Kickstarter alone, a figure that you'd think would more than pay for all of that, to say the least.)\n\nPosting on his own Electrical Audio message board, Albini wrote, \"I have no fundamental problem with either asking your fans to pay you to make your record or go on tour or play for free in your band or gather at a mud pit downstate and sell meth and blowjobs to each other. I wouldn't stoop to doing any of them myself, but horses for courses.\" He would never do that, he says, because he values self-sufficiency, something he clearly thinks Palmer does not. \"If your position is that you aren't able to figure out how to do that,\" he says, \"that you are forced by your ignorance into pleading for donations and charity work, you are then publicly admitting you are an idiot, and demonstrably not as good at your profession as Jandek, Moondog, GG Allin, every band ever to go on tour without a slush fund or the kids who play on buckets downtown.\"\n\nAfter a little back-and-forth with Palmer and her fans in the press, Albini did an email interview with the U.K. publication Stool Pigeon, in which he explained he wasn't just mad that Palmer seemed to have frittered more than $1 million away, but that she was also asking for fans to come be members of her band on the road, all without pay and under the guise that they'd be getting a supercool experience that only she could provide. \"It's cheapness repainted as generosity and it's gross,\" he told the publication. \"Using people in this way, exploiting their good nature for one's own benefit, is a cancer that taints many enterprises and it always reflects poorly on the exploiter. It's one of the things I hated most about the old-school record business, the practice of fucking with people who loved music so much they would put up with endless greed and abuse just to be a part of it.\"", "source": {"uri": "vulture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vulture"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marah_eakin@vulture.com", "name": "Marah Eakin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

He's best known for working with acts such as Nirvana, Pixies, PJ Harvey and Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, and for his own bands Big Black, Rapeman and Shellac. As the latter are set to release their first album since 2014, Albini will be answering your questions.\n\nRelated: The evolution of Steve Albini: 'If the dumbest person is on your side, you're on the wrong side'\n\nWhile studying for a journalism degree, Albini started Big Black and immersed himself into the music scene of Chicago, embodying punk's ethos with Big Black's forthright, abrasive songs and DIY spirit. He supported his income by taking music production jobs (or engineering, as he would rather frame it), and these eventually become a key part of his artistry, most famously with Nirvana's 1993 album In Utero. He founded his own studio, Electrical Audio, and still takes production jobs - always for a flat fee, refusing royalty payments in a show of solidarity with his artists.\n\nAfter Big Black's breakup, Albini formed and fronted Rapeman (a deliberately provocative name taken from a Japanese comic book) from 1987 to 1989, then formed Shellac in 1992 with drummer Todd Trainer and bassist Bob Weston. Celebrated for their minimalist, rhythmic, singular vision of alt-rock, they're back with To All Trains (the follow-up to 2014's Dude Incredible) made over a series of long weekends between 2017 and 2022.\n\nAhead of his album's release on 17 May on Touch and Go, Albini will be answering your questions. Post them in the comments below before 3pm BST on 13 May, and we'll publish his answers in the 17 May edition of our Film & Music section as well as online.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aneesa_ahmed@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Aneesa Ahmed", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Black", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Big Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapeman", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pixies (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shellac (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_and_Plant", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Page and Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ_Harvey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PJ Harvey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIY_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DIY (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punk rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Weston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob Weston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Trainer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Todd Trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_and_Go_Records", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touch and Go Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_Audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrical Audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minimal music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bassist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Summer Time"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drummer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alternative rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhythm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/89b281cd47ae20f711ff5be054049b7f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 1613, "textEnd": 1619, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 1728, "textEnd": 1734}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

She has been working at PEOPLE since 2024. Her work has previously appeared in POPSUGAR, Teen Vogue, ELLE, Refinery29 and more.\n\nSteve Albini, the influential underground rock figure best known for fronting bands like Shellac and Big Black, died on Tuesday, May 7, at the age of 61. The recording studio legend engineered classic albums like Nirvana's In Utero and Pixies' Surfer Rosa and operated the Chicago studio Electrical Audio until his final years. The vocalist and guitarist was also an outspoken critic of musicians and others who participated in exploitative industry practices.\n\nStaff members at Albini's studio, which he founded in 1997, confirmed to multiple outlets that a heart attack caused the revered rock musician's death. He's survived by his wife, filmmaker Heather Whinna.\n\nAlbini, who preferred the title \"recording engineer\" over \"producer,\" was born in 1962 in Pasadena, California, and later raised in Missoula, Montana. As a teen, he played in local punk bands before moving to Chicago in the late '70s to attend Northwestern University. He graduated with a journalism degree and went on to write about Chicago's emerging punk scene, where he'd become a fixture for pushing the boundaries of post-punk and alternative rock.\n\nHe rose to fame in the early '80s as the frontman for the Chicago-based trio he created, Big Black, which released a string of EPs that displayed the punk band's seething signature guitar sound. The band, comprised of guitarist Santiago Durango and bassist Jeff Pezzati, released their debut album, Atomizer, in 1986, followed by their second project, Songs About F---ing, a year later, which marked their break up.\n\n\"The more time passes, the more correct I think that assessment was,\" Albini told The Guardian in 2023. \"The band had persisted in making this hideous music and proven that if you have a valid set of working principles, you can do it on your own terms and never have to kiss anybody's ass.\"\n\nFollowing Big Black's split, Albini went on to form the noise rock band Rapeman. The band released only one album in 1988, Two Nuns and a Pack Mule, before also breaking up. Albini's musical efforts then turned toward the studio, where he lent his production to other artists' music, such as Robert Plant, The Stooges, Cheap Trick, Chevelle, and Superchunk.\n\nBy the early '90s, Albini continued to produce and engineer albums for various artists, widening his acclaim as he formed the band Shellac with drummer Todd Trainer and bassist Bob Weston in 1992. The trio released five albums during their years-long run, with their last, titled To All Trains, set to drop on May 17. The album, which they originally planned to tour, marks their first studio album release since 2014's Dude Incredible.\n\nBy his count, Albini worked on over 2,000 albums for mainstream acts and other artists over the course of his lifetime. \"If you pace yourself, you don't really have to worry about [burning out],\" he told Rolling Stone in 2014.\n\n\"I tend not to work at excruciating volume, so my ears are not physically fatigued,\" he continued. \"My attention span could still be fatigued, but there are tricks to preserve that ... You have to focus your attention on the minute details now and again, but if you spend every second of the session gritting your teeth and staring at the speakers and concentrating intently on every single thing that happens, then you eventually burn out your attention span, and then you can't do any work whatsoever.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"},

But he also stood for an ethos.\n\nFamous among rock fans for his work in the recording studio with the likes of Nirvana and the Pixies -- and for his own bands Shellac and Big Black -- Albini was known for harsh guitars and booming drums presented with none of the sweetening that can make a rock record sound like a candyland. As a producer (though he preferred to be called an engineer), he took a \"documentary approach to recording music,\" he told The Times in 1993, not long after he oversaw the making of Nirvana's final studio album, \"In Utero.\"\n\nYet Albini, who died Tuesday at age 61, was almost equally revered for his straightforward criticisms of the record industry and its propensity to corrupt the purity of creative expression. To him, stardom was a trap, which is one reason he was known for years to record virtually any band that asked him to at his studio in Chicago. What he offered musicians was wisdom, honesty and technical know-how; what he got out of his clients more often than not was some of their best work. Here, in the order they were released, are 12 of Albini's essential recordings.\n\n1. Big Black, \"Kerosene\" (1986)\n\nA would-be arsonist explains himself -- his motive: boredom -- as slashing guitars scrape against the mechanized thump of a Roland drum machine. No Big Black, no Nine Inch Nails.\n\n2. Pixies, \"Where Is My Mind?\" (1988)\n\n\"Never have I seen four cows more anxious to be led around by their nose rings,\" Albini famously wrote after recording the debut album by this seminal alt-rock quartet. Yet even now nothing sounds quite like the Pixies' most enduring tune: a haunted psychedelic-soul jam in which the ultra-reverbed backing vocals conjure the terrifying underwater expanse that singer Black Francis describes in his lyric. Thanks in part to a prominent placement in 1999's \"Fight Club,\" \"Where Is My Mind?\" has been streamed more than 850 million times on Spotify.\n\n3. The Breeders, \"Iris\" (1990)\n\nClearly unbothered by the nose-ring comment, the Pixies' Kim Deal drafted Albini to oversee the first record by her other band, and it's not hard to see why: No one ever showcased the feral beauty of Deal's singing like he did.\n\n4. Helmet, \"In the Meantime\" (1992)\n\nAlbini recorded only one tune for the major-label debut by this New York noise-rock outfit, but it's a scorcher. \"Earth tone suits you, so give it a smile,\" Page Hamilton barks over a groove so rigid it's almost funky.\n\n5. PJ Harvey, \"Rid of Me\" (1993)\n\n\"Lick my legs, I'm on fire / Lick my legs of desire,\" Harvey shrieks without accompaniment to end this pile-driving blues-punk come-on -- perhaps her most unflinching vocal performance in a career overflowing with them.\n\n6. Nirvana, \"Serve the Servants\" (1993)\n\nNirvana's follow-up to its epochal \"Nevermind\" opens like a grunge version of \"A Hard Day's Night,\" with a blast of unruly guitar noise that quickly gives way to a catchy complaint about having worked like a dog only to end up -- surprise! -- bored and old. Dave Grohl's drums have never hit harder.\n\n7. Jawbreaker, \"Do You Still Hate Me?\" (1994)\n\nWorking under the name of his cat, Fluss, Albini helped give this Bay Area punk trio a muscular bottom end that perfectly balanced singer Blake Schwarzenbach's desperate rasp.\n\n8. Shellac, \"Pull the Cup\" (1994)\n\nAfter years of putting riffs together, Albini tried taking one apart.\n\n9. Bush, \"Swallowed\" (1996)\n\nFor all his disgust with the mainstream record biz, Albini was more than willing to take a major-label check, as when Gavin Rossdale's band came to him in what seemed like an obvious attempt to fill the vacuum left behind when Kurt Cobain died. But Albini never took easy money as an opportunity to coast: Listen to how carefully he gets the sound of fingers on guitar strings into this beefcake power ballad.\n\n10. Jimmy Page & Robert Plant, \"Please Read the Letter\" (1998)\n\nA decade before Plant and Alison Krauss won a Grammy for record of the year with it, Albini captured the former Led Zeppelin bandmates' original take on this plaintive folk-rock tune. It stomps, it crunches, it jangles.\n\n11. Songs: Ohia, \"Farewell Transmission\" (2003)\n\nCut, as the story goes, in a single take with no rehearsal, this seven-minute epic by the group led by songwriter Jason Molina (who died in 2013) sounds like Neil Young fronting the Allman Brothers Band. A testament to Albini's knack for recognizing a moment when it arrived.\n\n12. Joanna Newsom, \"Monkey & Bear\" (2006)\n\nNot a serrated guitar in sight -- just Newsom's voice, her harp and Van Dyke Parks' pinprick orchestral arrangements, each recorded with such precision and intimacy that listening feels like being let in on a secret.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

So it was no surprise to see the Minnesota music community react strongly and reverentially to producer Steve Albini's unexpected death Tuesday from a heart attack at age 61.\n\nPachyderm Recording Studio, the semi-secluded facility in Cannon Falls where Albini produced Nirvana's last album \"In Utero,\" issued a statement Wednesday saying, \"We will keep his spirit going the best we can.\"\n\nThe famously altruistic Chicago noise-rock specialist -- whose own bands Shellac and Big Black played the Twin Cities often -- also worked with British alt-rocker PJ Harvey on her \"Rid of Me\" a couple months before the Nirvana sessions at Pachyderm in the winter of 1992-1993.\n\n\"The industry has lost a legend,\" read Pachyderm's social-media posts. \"Steve Albini showed us how to make good music with integrity, in the most punk way ever. Some of the biggest records done at Pachyderm were produced by Steve. ... His death leaves a big hole in the music industry.\"\n\nAlan Sparhawk of Low -- whose T-shirt Albini wore in a photo widely used with his obituaries Wednesday -- lovingly recounted making his band's groundbreaking 2001 album, \"Things We Lost in the Fire,\" at Albini's Electric Audio studio in Chicago.\n\nAlbini seemed like an odd fit for the daringly hushed Duluth trio, given his penchant for working with high-volume bands. Not only did he make a classic record with them, though. Turns out, the infamously irascible producer also got on very well with Sparhawk's famously low-key bandmate and late wife Mimi Parker.\n\n\"I remember that Zak and I were just giddy to get to record with him,\" Sparhawk posted via Low's X (Twitter) account @lowtheband, referring to bassist Zak Sally.\n\n\"Mim was like 'ya whatever,' but then they hit it off and got along like old school buddies. They both had the same dry sense of humor and would give each other [expletive] about reverb and tooth brushing.\"\n\nSparhawk also retweeted many articles and memories from other musicians and admirers of Albini. One of the most retweeted posts on X was from Nirvana's account, which featured a four-page letter Albini sent the band ahead of working at Pachyderm that demonstrated his unflashy punk approach to recording (\"Leave room for accidents or chaos,\" he wrote) and his exceptionally ungreedy business tactics (\"I think paying a royalty to a producer or engineer is ethically indefensible\").\n\nBesides Low, Albini also worked with a much noisier but lesser-known Minnesota band, STNNNG, producing two of the Minneapolis quintet's ultra-intense and underappreciated records, 2013's \"Empire Inward\" and 2017's \"Veterans of Pleasure.\" The dormant band's X account came alive Wednesday with a photo of the group working in the studio with Albini.\n\n\"Thank you Steve, so much, so, so much,\" the STNNNG post read.\n\nOne of Albini's own bandmates, Shellac drummer Todd Trainer, is a Twin Cities music vet who worked with him over four decades. He has not commented yet on his friend's sudden passing. They were due to play U.K. dates together in June and have a new album due out May 17 via Touch & Go Records titled \"To the Trains.\"\n\nLast but not least, First Avenue's accounts also sent out a tribute to Albini along with a photo by local lensman Darin Kamnetz from his last of innumerable performances there in May 2022. In it, Albini is wearing a rather perfect T-shirt that reads, \"I am begging you stop emailing me.\" Both Big Black and Shellac have stars painted on First Ave's fa\u00e7ade.\n\n\"First Avenue was lucky to work with and host Steve Albini over the years,\" the club's post reads. \"He will be missed.\"", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors":

The first time I met him was about 30 years ago. I was a graduate student at Northwestern University and assigned to interview somebody, and I had just bought \"In Utero,\" Nirvana's follow-up to its blockbuster album \"Nevermind.\" Albini was the producer of \"In Utero,\" and one of my favorite albums, The Pixies' \"Surfer Rosa,\" and so I called him, he agreed to chat, and while I remember little of what he said, I remember we talked for hours.\n\nHe had studied journalism himself at Northwestern, so he was generous. He had endless opinions on culture and music and what it means to stand by your convictions. I remember at point simply asking what a record producer did. He said he wasn't a record producer, he was a record engineer. I asked what that was, and he said it was like a record producer.\n\nA year ago, the last time I spoke to him, I asked about his first concert, and he replied as he replied to everything, with too much knowledge and detail and an opinion so insightful and provocative and hilarious that it sucked the air from the room. The concert was the Edgar Winter Group, Sept. 27, 1975, Montana, where he lived as a teenager. He recalled his father saying people only went to rock shows to buy drugs. He recalled, as Edgar Winter launched into a 20-minute keyboard solo, the \"dead-eyed gaze\" of Johnny Winter \"navigating solo breaks in this tumultuous excess, like Ahab resigned to his fate in a dinghy, tossed by the sea and pernicious corpus of his brother's prog rock white whale ...\" He didn't know if the concert itself was exactly a good idea, but: \"An impressionable young Steve thanks whoever set it up for those enduring images of madness and futility.\"\n\nAlbini talked like that.\n\nHe was an intimidating guy, and eventually, a sweet guy. He was, as kids say these days, a \"gatekeeper,\" the prototypical record store owner who frowns at what you bring to his cash register -- though he made records, he didn't sell them. The day after he died, the satirical website Hard Times posted this headline: \"Steve Albini standing outside gates of Heaven telling everyone how much he hates the Smashing Pumpkins.\"\n\nHe could go off on corporate culture and its deadening effects on artists and consumers (and did so elegantly at times, for literary journals like the Hyde Park-based Baffler). He produced famous records and made lesser-known ones with his bands Big Black and Shellac, but also became, by dint of his taste, a sought-after totem of cultural integrity -- a representative of a way of being. Or as comedian Fred Armisen told this newspaper several years ago: \"Steve Albini became a huge influence on me, which I don't know if he knows. He had this philosophy on how to live and be and gave me advice I still keep in mind.\" As for Albini, he always kept it blunt: \"I wasn't a fan of Trenchmouth (Armisen's Chicago-based punk band) -- and so that's not why we would have become friends.\"\n\nHe was vintage Gen-X sarcastic, ironic, contrarian, defiantly principled. One of the best things ever written on music was Albini's 1993 essay \"The Problem With Music\" for the Baffler, in which he laid out finances, empty promises, unnecessary flourishes. It opens with quite the metaphor: a band (\"some of them good friends, some of them barely acquaintances\") standing at one end of a trench filled with waste and at the other end is a music industry \"lackey\" with a fountain pen and contract. Whoever swims the trench first will get the deal. Only then, the industry insists: \"Swim it again, please. Backstroke.\"\n\nThomas Frank, the founder of the Baffler, told me in an email that he never knew Albini personally, but that essay for the journal would become its \"consummate expression\": \"Seeing through the falsehoods of the culture industry was the first order of business, and no one was better at it than Steve Albini.\"\n\nBy credits alone, Albini became not only a glue stick of underground music, and a major influence around the country as Wicker Park became an early '90s music mecca, but a tastemaker for what was once called college radio music and later rebranded \"alt rock.\"\n\nHe held it to ideals that no popular cultural business could entirely satisfy.\n\nHe recorded a who's who of '90s Chicago bands (including Urge Overkill, Veruca Salt and Jesus Lizard); alt superstars (PJ Harvey, Bush); and the occasional icon (Robert Plant and Jimmy Page, The Stooges, Cheap Trick). He became known for applying loving sonic care to acts best known by their fields of distortion. He captured, as the cliche went, how a performer sounded live. But attaining clarity, power and honesty seemed deceptively easy. As Albini told Chicago magazine in 1997: \"I honestly just feel that music like this deserves to be taken seriously. And that means people who record them should be as concerned about quality as if they were recording the (expletive) Chicago symphony.\"\n\nYet, at the peak of his influence, he also said: \"If you wanted to take punk seriously on a more significant level, you could. If you pretend to take dance music seriously on a more significant level, that is a delusional pretension. There really is no substance to it.\"\n\nRick Nielsen of Cheap Trick said they first met in the late 1970s. A teenage Albini sold him a guitar. Nielsen's son Miles, now of the Rockford-based band Rusted Hearts, even helped Albini physically build his Electrical Audio studio in Avondale. When Albini later produced Cheap Trick, he was \"a stickler, but excellent,\" Nielsen said. He had \"this reputation as a tough guy,\" though Nielsen suspects \"a lot of it came from record execs because Steve was so different. He was the most honest person in the music business.\n\n\"And that's a list without a lot of company.\"\n\nStill, as Albini got older, he came to regret some of the hardline things he spouted. (He once wrote for a music zine that the Replacements' breakthrough \"Let It Be\" was a \"sad, pathetic end to a long downhill slide.\") Michael Azerrad, biographer of Nirvana and author of \"Our Band Could Be Your Life,\" posted Wednesday on X that Albini \"was a great artist and underwent the most remarkable and inspiring personal transformation.\" With years came warmth, pleasantness. He faced his incendiary urges. After all, here was a man who once, for a Northwestern art class, invited 100 of his enemies to throw stuff at him as he swore at them behind Plexiglass.\n\nPeople threw dog poop, bricks, bowling pins.\n\nMartin Atkins, former drummer of Public Image Ltd., a Pilsen resident and industrial mainstay with bands such as Pigface, Nine Inch Nails and Killing Joke, recorded with Albini for years. \"We would argue,\" he said. \"He didn't like the idea that Pigface was touring in a bus. He would say, 'Oh, what a bunch of (expletive) rock stars!' And I would go, \"Steve, there are 16 of us! What would you want us to do -- tour in five mini-vans?\n\n\"I remember in Minnesota, coming back from one of his favorite studios, he agreed to drive me to the airport and we argued music for so long that he drove 40 minutes past the airport and I missed my flight. Things were often very cut and dry to Steve, but always centered on the glorious movement of sound. Whatever personal, spiritual, creative problems he might have had, he worked hard to clear them out to get you your sound.\"\n\nIndeed, of all the legendary tales of Steve Albini, one of the best is the long letter that he wrote to Nirvana before recording \"In Utero,\" to lay out his philosophy and expectations:\n\n\"I do not want and will not take a royalty on any record I record. ... I think paying a royalty to a producer or engineer is ethically indefensible. ... I would like to be paid like a plumber: I do the job and you pay me what it's worth. The record company will expect me to ask for a point or a point and a half. If we assume three million sales, that works out to 400,000 dollars or so. There's no (expletive) way I would ever take that much money. I wouldn't be able to sleep.\"\n\nNirvana, eager to retain a shred of indie cred after becoming the biggest band in the world, was a natural fit with Albini. The problem was, after they made \"In Utero,\" the record company hated its sound; the band itself began airing doubts. And so, before release, changes were made. Moreover, Albini's reputation as a pedantic, prickly and iconoclastic collaborator, quick to question someone's ideology, caught up to him.\n\nHe told interviewers major labels didn't want to work with him; critics accused him of selling out by working with them at all, then being fast to complain if it went badly.\n\nBut as goofy as it sounds now, since that concept has lost its meaning: He never could sell out. Not the way we assume artists inevitably do. He retained a pure righteous punk intention, except when astringent logic failed. Talking about his young, uncompromising self, he gave himself little room to hide. Last year he told the Guardian newspaper: \"The one thing I don't want to do is say: 'The culture shifted -- excuse my behavior.' It provides a context for why I was wrong at the time, but I was wrong at the time.\"\n\nIn an Instagram post on Wednesday, Armisen said that just the other day Albini had texted him about cymbals. He didn't get cymbals: \"Like I can tell the difference between this one and that one but if I'm honest they both sound like cymbals and I don't care.\"\n\nArmisen concluded: \"I always loved hearing him say 'I don't care.'\"", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_borrelli@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Christopher

Not just in the sound he produced but also his approach and ethos was always inspiring and deeply rooted in what I love about alternative culture. I grew up loving some of those Big Black singles as I immersed myself in independent music.\n\n\"Like many of us, I was obsessed with the sound of those Pixies records and In Utero and later Journal For Plague Lovers by Manic Street Preachers. Hearing about his success as a poker player and winning a million was also mind-blowing. I never met him but watched countless YouTube videos of him talking about making records, and his approach delivered with his wit stuck to me like glue.\n\n\"My sincerest condolences to his family and friends. 61 is no age to go.\"\n\nFear Factory: \"R.I.P. Steve Albini. The legendary producer, songwriter and musician has passed away. His band Big Black was a big influence on us in the early stages of our careers.\"\n\nViolent Femmes: \"Bad day for recording. ET Thorngren and Steve Albini in one day. Two very influential and innovative engineers. I did not know Steve but he was a provocateur and made some great recordings. His ideas are also worth investigating.\"\n\nHugh Cornwall: \"Steve Albini was a lovely guy, incredibly gifted in the recording studio, and a major loss to our music world. It was a privilege to work with him on Totem & Taboo.\"", "source": {"uri": "loudersound.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "loudersound"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fraser_lewry@loudersound.com", "name":

He played in various bands during high school and later earned a journalism degree from Northwestern University. His career as a recording engineer began with his own group, Big Black, and he famously preferred the title 'engineer' over 'producer', valuing a hands-off approach that focused on capturing the essence of a band's live sound without taking ongoing royalties.\n\nAlbini leaves behind a legacy of groundbreaking work and a distinct approach to music production that has influenced the indie and underground rock scenes profoundly.

He was 61.\n\nStaff at the studio, Electrical Audio, have confirmed to Pitchfork that Albini died on Tuesday.\n\nThe late musician fronted bands such as Big Black, Rapeman and Shellac, while he also produced albums for the likes of Nirvana, Pixies, PJ Harvey, and Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.\n\nAlbini was heavily influenced by the punk movement during his younger years, and he ultimately founded his own music project called Big Black, firstly as a solo effort before it eventually became a quartet.\n\nThe group released their debut album, \"Atomizer\" in 1986, and they're now recognized as one of the most influential punk groups of the era.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Together, they released five albums and the group are actually scheduled to release their latest record, \"To All Trains,\" next week.\n\nAlbini is probably best know for producing the final studio album by Nirvana, \"In Utero,\" which was released in 1993.\n\nIn 1995, Albini established his own recording studio and he worked with several high-profile acts, including Joanna Newsom, Low, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Manic Street Preachers and Jarvis Cocker.\n\nAway from the music scene, Albini also enjoyed huge success as a poker player, winning two bracelets at World Series of Poker tournaments, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money.\n\nAlbini is survived by his wife, movie-maker Heather Whinna.\n\nPhotos: Notable deaths in 2024 Glynis Johns Adan Canto Bud Harrelson Dejan Milojevic Jack Burke Mary Weiss Norman Jewison Charles Osgood Melanie Safka Chita Rivera Carl Weathers Wayne Kramer Ian Lavender Toby Keith Henry Fambrough Bob Edwards Don Gullett Lefty Driesell Andreas Brehme Golden Richards Richard Lewis Nikolai Ryzhkov Brian Mulroney Akira Toriyama Iris Apfel Andy Russell Ed Ott Chris Mortensen Steve Lawrence Naomi Barber King Paul Alexander Thomas P.

The 'You Said Something' singer chose to work with Albini after admiring his distinctively raw recordings of bands like Pixies, Slint, The Breeders and The Jesus Lizard.\n\nThe legendary record producer - who was the mastermind behind iconic albums such as Nirvana's 'In Utero' and Manic Street Preachers' 'Journal For Plague Lovers'- died yesterday (May 8) of a heart attack while at Electronic Audio - his recording studio in Chicago. His death was confirmed by the studio's staff members.\n\nTaking to her Instagram account, Harvey shared a photo of the front and back cover of 'Rid Of Me' and paid tribute to Albini in the caption.\n\n\"Meeting Steve Albini and working with him changed the course of my life. He taught me so much about music, and life. Steve was a great friend - wise, kind and generous. I am so grateful,\" she wrote. \"My thoughts are with him and his family and friends as we suffer his loss.\"\n\nWhile appearing on MTV's 120 Minutes in 1993, the musican explained that Albini's: \"Sound just sounds like a band. He's the only person I know that can record a drum kit and it sounds like you're standing in front of a drum kit.\"\n\nShe continued: \"It doesn't sound like it's gone through a recording process or it's coming out of speakers. You can feel the sound he records, and that is why I wanted to work with him, 'cause all I ever wanted is for us to be recorded and to sound like we do when we're playing together in a room, and that's never happened before.\" She also praised his innovative studio setup for \"capturing the feeling of the sound.\"\n\nUpon its release, 'Rid Of Me' landed the Number Three spot on the UK charts and the Number 10 spot on the Bilboard US Heatseekers Albums Chart. The LP would go on to garner admiration from various musicians such as Elastica, Karen O, Courtney Love, Alanis Morissette, Phoebe Bridgers and Ethel Cain.\n\nIn other news, Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker recently paid tribute to Albini, sharing: \"Listen to the music he was involved in & read what he wrote about it. It's worth it.\"\n\nThe Cribs also paid tribute to the legendary producer, writing \"It's hard to imagine Steve Albini being gone\".", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME

He was 61.\n\nThe frontman for Shellac and Big Black died Wednesday, according to a report by Pitchfork.\n\nFor more than three decades, Albini made his musical magic happen at his Electrical Audio on Belmont Avenue, recording thousands of artists from across the city and across the globe.\n\nThe studio confirmed his passing to WBEZ radio, adding Albini died after suffering a heart attack.\n\nBorn in Pasadena, California, on July 22, 1962, and raised in Montana, Albini moved to Evanston to attend Northwestern University where he graduated with a degree in journalism from the Medill School.\n\nA new album, \"To All Trains,\" from the singer-guitarist and his Shellac bandmates Bob Weston and Todd Trainer and recorded at Electronic Audio is scheduled for release next week. The band was also planning to tour in support of the new album, their first in a decade.\n\nIn a 2021 interview with the Sun-Times, Albini was asked if he considered himself successful.\n\n\"To the extent that I could care about that, I would say yes,\" he told Sun-Times columnist Neil Steinberg. \"I've lived my whole life without having goals, and I think that's very valuable, because then I never am in a state of anxiety or dissatisfaction. I never feel I haven't achieved something. I never feel there is something yet to be accomplished. I feel like goals are quite counterproductive. They give you a target, and until the moment you reach that target, you are stressed and unsatisfied, and at the moment you reach that specific target you are aimless and have lost the lodestar of your existence. I've always tried to see everything as a process. I want to do things in a certain way that I can be proud of that is sustainable and is fair and equitable to everybody that I interact with. If I can do that, then that's a success, and success means that I get to do it again tomorrow.\"", "source": {"uri": "chicago.suntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Sun-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shellac (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pixies (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_Audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrical Audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_Lizard", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Jesus Lizard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Black", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belmont University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitchfork_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitchfork (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indie rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ_Harvey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PJ Harvey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Weston", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob Weston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Trainer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Todd Trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBEZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WBEZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northwestern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronic music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pasadena, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pasadena, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evanston,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evanston, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Evanston, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2bb743/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3936x2247+0+189/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F82%2F9d%2F704998854d6b88e7e33e4465e213%2Fsteinberg-08xx21-2.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

My thoughts go out to his friends and family.\"\n\nStarchild & the New Romantic's Bryndon Cook also posted a memory of Albini on X: \"i once snuck into First Avenue to borrow a keyboard stand, only to stumble on a Shellac soundcheck.

Albini, of course, famously worked on the band's final studio album, 1993's In Utero.\n\nNirvana's tribute was simple, yet poignant. On X, the band's surviving members shared the letter Albini wrote to the band, laying out how he would tackle working on In Utero. The four-page letter is a perfect representation of who Albini truly was as a musician and engineer.\n\nAlbini writes on the first page, \"I think the very best thing you could do at this point is exactly what you are talking about doing: Bang a record out in a couple of days, with high quality by minimal 'production' and no interference from the front office bulletheads. If that is indeed what you want to do, I would love to be involved.\"\n\nAlbini lays out his \"recording methodology and philosophy\" in four points. In his first point, he notably writes, \"I prefer to work on records that aspire to greater things, like originality, personality and enthusiasm. If every element of the music and dynamics of a band is controlled by click tracks, computers, automated mixes, gates, samplers and sequencers, then the record may not be incompetent, but it certainly won't be exceptional. It will also bear very little relationship to the live band, which is what all this hooey is supposed to be about.\"\n\nThe Impact of In Utero\n\nIn Utero features the classic tracks \"Heart-Shaped Box\" and \"All Apologies.\" It's well known that Albini was offered a cut of the royalties from In Utero, but he refused to accept them, even though he had the potential to earn about $500,000.\n\nHe addressed that in the above letter by writing, \"I would like to be paid like a plumber: I do the job and you pay me what it's worth. The record company will expect me to ask for a point or a point and a half. If we assume three million sales, that works out to 400,000 dollars or so. There's no f -- ing was I would ever take that much money. I wouldn't be able to sleep.\"\n\nInstead, he opted to take a flat fee of $100,000 up front, because he didn't believe in taking royalties away from an artist.\n\nAlbini told Mojo about his flat fee, \"That seemed to satisfy everybody. I think at that point there were still people who were sort of justifying their jobs by being suspicious of me.\"\n\nAs far as pressure goes in making the album that followed the smash hit Nevermind, Albini said he and Nirvana really weren't phased. He told Louder Sound, \"The pressure was all on the industry people, the people who were terrified of losing their status, influence, and income if the record wasn't a success. The band knew they had a good record in them, I knew they were doing a great job in the studio.\"\n\nReleased on September 21, 1993, In Utero debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart and sold 180,000 copies in its first week, despite some major retailers refusing to sell it due to its artwork. The album has since gone on to sell five million copies in the United States and 15 million copies worldwide.", "source": {"uri": "wrif.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WRIF Rocks Detroit"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erica_banas@wrif.com", "name": "Erica Banas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalty_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royalty payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart-Shaped_Box", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heart-Shaped Box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Apologies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All Apologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_sequencer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music sequencer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampler_(musical_instrument)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sampler (musical instrument)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Rock_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Classic Rock (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojo_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mojo (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard 200"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home_Recording", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home Recording", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://wrif.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2024/05/GettyImages-1463259863-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 106, "textEnd": 111}, {"amb": false, "date": "1993-09-21", "textStart": 2765, "textEnd": 2783}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Fuck digital.\n\nAs a tsunami of CDs, DAT tapes and samplers swept the recording industry in the late 1980s, Big Black frontman and alternative music agent provocateur Steve Albini threw down the gauntlet in defiance.\n\nHis commitment to analogue recording processes and the permanency of analogue media resonated among alternative music communities sceptical of the major record industry, and their perceptions of impending digital doom.\n\nThis quote, taken from the liner notes of Big Black's sophomore album Songs About Fucking (1987), signified the end of Albini's band and the beginning of his recording career.\n\nAlbini's untimely death at the age of 61 is a huge loss to independent music.\n\nAn analogue sound\n\nA prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of London's Southern Studios recordist John Loder (CRASS, Ministry, Jesus and Mary Chain), Albini peeled the remnants of analogue recording from Southern's sticky floors and stuck it all over Chicago's alternative music scene.\n\nHe quickly carved out a reputation as a go-to recordist for artists wanting to achieve a transparent representation of a live sonic aesthetic.\n\nFrom The Jesus Lizard to Manic Street Preachers, Pixies to The Stooges, Albini applied his same raw-and-roomy drum microphone techniques alongside uncompromisingly upfront guitars to every session - regardless of whether the client was an indie rock giant or an emergent local band.\n\nIn 2003, Albini's commitment to technologically unobtrusive recording sessions was immortalised in David Josephson's e-22S - a small diaphragm condenser microphone built to Albini's requirements and bearing his Electrical Audio studio insignia.\n\nThe power of words - and music\n\nAs a journalism graduate from Northwestern University, Albini routinely provoked outrage with his nonchalant commentary of extreme events and material, writing for local fanzines and reviewing the Chicago punk scene.\n\nArmed with a Roland TR606 drum machine and a penchant for horror stories in the local news, I previously described Albini's noise-punk as \"designed to confront listeners with real-life horrors of suburbia, to reflect bigotry and social exclusion and to mediate the extremities of human behaviour via equally confronting music.\"\n\nIn 2020, Albini apologised for his confrontational writing - and later band name Rapeman - as \"unconscionable\" and \"indefensible\", a result, he said, of his unchecked privilege.\n\nAll apologies aside, it is hardly likely the dozens of women and LGBTQI+ artists Albini recorded - including Laura Jane Grace, The Breeders, Nina Nastasia, Screaming Females and PJ Harvey, to name but a few - would have set foot in his studio had Albini's deviant satirising reflected his true politics or beliefs.\n\nAfter all this is the man, who when writing to Nirvana to pitch the recording for their In Utero album, told them he'd \"rap your head with a ratchet\" in the same letter he humbly insisted on no points or royalties.\n\nThe only person I wanted to call\n\nAlbini's reputation as an unapproachable and prickly recalcitrant was far from the truth.\n\nFor those fortunate enough to have recorded with Albini, he was known as a kind, patient and accommodating engineer, eager to make bands feel at home and committed to capturing the truest possible representation of their live sound.\n\nThis was my experience, too.\n\nAs a young doctoral student researching sound recording and production techniques in 2009, Albini was only too happy to discuss his career and recording techniques with me.\n\n\"I feel like it borders on the fraudulent for me to charge for a recording session knowing that the product of that recording session is going to be impermanent,\" he told me. He was adamant tape was still the only reliable recording medium well into the 21st century.\n\nA couple of years later when we needed a keynote for the Art of Record Production conference, there was only one person I knew to call. Albini happily obliged - despite spending most of the conference weekend glued to online poker tournaments.\n\nAs an analogue loyalist, Albini was perhaps the recording industry's last man standing. Technically accomplished, sonically subversive and fiercely independent, in his later years he showed a rare humility for a decorated recording engineer, and an open willingness to teach in the face of relentless industry gatekeeping.\n\nNever a nostalgic, Albini demythologised recording processes with a stream of recording videos shot from his own Electric Audio studios. Dressed in his trademark navy blue overalls and beanie, just a week ago Albini happily explained the schematic of a SamAmp VA tube preamplifier in a video that effortlessly blends in-depth electronics theory with an exuberant punk joy de vivre.\n\nAlbini's final album with band Shellac, To All Trains, will be released on May 17.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news",

He was 61.\n\nAlbini's death was confirmed by a number of outlets, including Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and Consequence. Both Pitchfork and Consequence report Albini's cause of death being from a heart attack.\n\nWhile Albini was a member of a number of bands, including fronting Big Black and Shellac, his biggest credits came from his behind-the-scenes work. He founded the recording studio Electrical Audio in 1997 in Chicago. Alibini did the work of a producer, but he wasn't a fan of the term and preferred to be called an \"engineer.\"\n\nAlbini told Mojo about his flat fee, \"That seemed to satisfy everybody. I think at that point there were still people who were sort of justifying their jobs by being suspicious of me.\"\n\nAs far as pressure goes in making the album that followed the smash hit Nevermind, Albini said he and Nirvana really weren't phased. He told Louder Sound, \"The pressure was all on the industry people, the people who were terrified of losing their status, influence, and income if the record wasn't a success.

Fuck digital.\n\nAs a tsunami of CDs, DAT tapes and samplers swept the recording industry in the late 1980s, Big Black frontman and alternative music agent provocateur Steve Albini threw down the gauntlet in defiance.\n\nHis commitment to analogue recording processes and the permanency of analogue media resonated among alternative music communities sceptical of the major record industry, and their perceptions of impending digital doom.\n\nThis quote, taken from the liner notes of Big Black's sophomore album Songs About Fucking (1987), signified the end of Albini's band and the beginning of his recording career.\n\nAlbini's untimely death at the age of 61 is a huge loss to independent music.\n\nA prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of London's Southern Studios recordist John Loder (CRASS, Ministry, Jesus and Mary Chain), Albini peeled the remnants of analogue recording from Southern's sticky floors and stuck it all over Chicago's alternative music scene.\n\nHe quickly carved out a reputation as a go-to recordist for artists wanting to achieve a transparent representation of a live sonic aesthetic.\n\nFrom The Jesus Lizard to Manic Street Preachers, Pixies to The Stooges, Albini applied his same raw-and-roomy drum microphone techniques alongside uncompromisingly upfront guitars to every session - regardless of whether the client was an indie rock giant or an emergent local band.\n\nIn 2003, Albini's commitment to technologically unobtrusive recording sessions was immortalised in David Josephson's e-22S - a small diaphragm condenser microphone built to Albini's requirements and bearing his Electrical Audio studio insignia.\n\nAs a journalism graduate from Northwestern University, Albini routinely provoked outrage with his nonchalant commentary of extreme events and material, writing for local fanzines and reviewing the Chicago punk scene.\n\nArmed with a Roland TR606 drum machine and a penchant for horror stories in the local news, I previously described Albini's noise-punk as \"designed to confront listeners with real-life horrors of suburbia, to reflect bigotry and social exclusion and to mediate the extremities of human behaviour via equally confronting music.\"\n\nIn 2020, Albini apologised for his confrontational writing - and later band name Rapeman - as \"unconscionable\" and \"indefensible\", a result, he said, of his unchecked privilege.\n\nAll apologies aside, it is hardly likely the dozens of women and LGBTQI+ artists Albini recorded - including Laura Jane Grace, The Breeders, Nina Nastasia, Screaming Females and PJ Harvey, to name but a few - would have set foot in his studio had Albini's deviant satirising reflected his true politics or beliefs.\n\nAfter all this is the man, who when writing to Nirvana to pitch the recording for their In Utero album, told them he'd \"rap your head with a ratchet\" in the same letter he humbly insisted on no points or royalties.\n\nAlbini's reputation as an unapproachable and prickly recalcitrant was far from the truth.\n\nFor those fortunate enough to have recorded with Albini, he was known as a kind, patient and accommodating engineer, eager to make bands feel at home and committed to capturing the truest possible representation of their live sound.\n\nThis was my experience, too.\n\nAs a young doctoral student researching sound recording and production techniques in 2009, Albini was only too happy to discuss his career and recording techniques with me.\n\n\"I feel like it borders on the fraudulent for me to charge for a recording session knowing that the product of that recording session is going to be impermanent,\" he told me. He was adamant tape was still the only reliable recording medium well into the 21st century.\n\nA couple of years later when we needed a keynote for the Art of Record Production conference, there was only one person I knew to call. Albini happily obliged - despite spending most of the conference weekend glued to online poker tournaments.\n\nAs an analogue loyalist, Albini was perhaps the recording industry's last man standing. Technically accomplished, sonically subversive and fiercely independent, in his later years he showed a rare humility for a decorated recording engineer, and an open willingness to teach in the face of relentless industry gatekeeping.\n\nNever a nostalgic, Albini demythologised recording processes with a stream of recording videos shot from his own Electric Audio studios. Dressed in his trademark navy blue overalls and beanie, just a week ago Albini happily explained the schematic of a SamAmp VA tube preamplifier in a video that effortlessly blends in-depth electronics theory with an exuberant punk joy de vivre.\n\nAlbini's final album with band Shellac, To All Trains, will be released on May 17.\n\nSamantha Bennett does not work for, consult, own shares in or

He was 61.\n\nAlbini's list of credits is impossibly long and impressive. His work with artists like Nirvana, Pixies, PJ Harvey and Ty Segall, as well as his own bands like Shellac and Big Black, have resulted in some of the most influential records of all time.\n\nHis no-nonsense, anti-capitalist attitude towards the music industry has made him a beacon for musicians who want to enjoy a career making art without becoming too entangled with the machinations of the music industry.\n\nHis famous The Problem With Music essay, and his letter to Nirvana before they worked together are classic examples of his unique ethos.\n\nBelow, we've put together just 10 examples of Albini's greatness as an engineer and musician to help celebrate a truly remarkable career.\n\nPerhaps the best-known work of Albini's career was probably also the most contentious. Nirvana's 1993 album is a true modern rock classic, but the path to its release got messier than anyone would have liked.\n\nAlbini jumped on triple j not long after its release to chat with Richard Kingsmill about the album and the effect it had on his life at that point, in typically forthright fashion.\n\n\"I enjoyed working with them and recording that record quite a bit,\" he said.\n\nThe chaos he speaks of started when the band's label took issue with the album's abrasive sound, a hallmark of Albini's work that Nirvana had initially wanted to tap into.\n\nSongs were ultimately remixed by slicker producers, to Albini's chagrin, and there was a lot of back and forth about why the record sounded the way it did.\n\nAlbini told triple j that, importantly, Nirvana got their way.\n\n\"The record that is in the stores now is ultimately the record that the band wanted to be there,\" he said.\n\n\"The band did ultimately get everything that they wanted. They were responsible for picking the songs, the songs that were remixed were remixed at their behest and under their supervision. The mastering was done under their control.\n\n\"The record that people are buying in the store is exactly the record that Nirvana wanted them to buy.\"\n\nHowever, the experience left a sour taste in Albini's mouth and he admitted he wasn't able to listen to the final product.\n\n\"I haven't listened to it at all since it's been released,\" he said.\n\n\"I was quite proud of the job I did on that record before all the chaos started, and then all the yelling and shouting and finger pointing and people saying that I'd ruined their record and stuff. Once that started, it became very difficult for me to even hear those songs and keep my lunch down.\"\n\nAt the time, he felt that working on In Utero would be detrimental to his career as major labels perceived him as difficult to work with.\n\n\"I did that record in in February and, since then, I haven't had a single telephone call from somebody from a record company asking me to work on a major band. I haven't even had so much as a as a whisper of interest from a big band since then. I'd be very surprised if it ever happens.\"\n\nMoreso, the types of fledgling bands that Albini had worked with consistently since the beginning of his career began to see him as out of reach after working with the world's biggest rock band.\n\n\"The Nirvana record has been pretty destructive in that respect,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of the smaller bands tend to think that I'm either now part of the big corporate music industry, or they think that because of that record was a success, I am now going to be charging outlandish sums of money to do records and I'm out of their league.\n\n\"There are lots of things about it that have been quite negative and quite destructive.\"\n\nThe impact of the Nirvana ballyhoo didn't stop the creative forces behind Led Zeppelin, one of the world's biggest rock bands, from enlisting Albini to help them make a rare late-era record.\n\nJimmy Page and Robert Plant's Walking Into Clarksdale is not their best work, nor is it Albini's, but its testament to the engineer's reputation that these titans of rock'n'roll chose him when they decided they wanted to make a straightforward, stripped back rock record.\n\n\"He really caught what was in the room,\" Plant told Dave Grohl for Ray Gun magazine.\n\n\"He got it all sounding really good in the shortest space of time. Without any pain at all.\n\n\"Without him, we wouldn't have made a great record.\"\n\nThe album that essentially drafted the alt-rock blueprint and cemented the Pixies and Albini's names in the history books.\n\nThe quiet-loud dynamics, the surreal songwriting, the gritty, experimental flourishes -- it's all here on a record whose influence extended to luminaries like Kurt Cobain, Smashing Pumpkins, Radiohead, David Bowie and well beyond.\n\nBut Surfer Rosa had humble beginnings, with a simple suggestion from the head of Pixies' label, 4AD, they should link up with the frontman for underground Chicago faves, Big Black.\n\n\"We met Steve Albini at a coffee shop and that was it, we were in the next day,\" guitarist Joey Santiago told Guitar.com in 2018. \"We were excited to get the Pixies on the map.\"\n\nThe band were confident in the road-tested material that would make up their full-length debut, \"it just had to get captured in an exciting sense, and Albini was a pretty damn good choice.\"\n\nThat's the understatement of the century.\n\nAlbini's no-nonsense recording philosophy was a perfect match for Pixies' offbeat song-craft. His approach was exacting, prioritising authenticity above all else while still getting gnarly guitars, pummelling drums, spontaneous takes and rendering plenty of actual space between it all.\n\nSurfer Rosa was certified proof you didn't need a fancy studio or effects to craft a classic. Kim Deal's vocals for 'Gigantic' and 'Where Is My Mind?' -- two of indie rock's most enduring anthems -- were recorded in a cement-lined bathroom.\n\nHoled up at Boston's Q-Division studio, Surfer Rosa was recorded in just 10 days. That \"seemed lavish by my standards,\" Albini told the Life of the Record podcast in 2023, adding with a chuckle: \"Having more than a week to make a record just seemed like an absurd luxury in my mind.\n\nAlbini charged a fee of US$1,500 and declined to take royalties, a rule he lived by his whole career because he deemed it \"unethical\" to make money from artists' work in perpetuity.\n\nLiving by those same rigorous standards and a deep disdain for commercial music practises also led to him disowning the album that first cemented his legacy.\n\nIn a 1994 issue of fanzine Forced Exposure, he dismissed Surfer Rosa as \"a patchwork pinch-loaf from a band who at their top dollar best are blandly entertaining college rock\".\n\nHowever, he'd later walk back his comments and apologised.\n\n\"I'm ashamed of the way I treated [Pixies]. They didn't deserve that,\" Albini told Life of the Record.\n\n\"At the time, I had all of these like conflicting intellectual perspectives on it, and I couldn't just listen to it for its effect. And now when I hear it as a finished record, I think it sounds very good and I think the band sounds very good and I don't find a lot to criticise.\"\n\nNearly 40 years later, very few music scholars can either.\n\nWhen Albini was approached by Nirvana to work on In Utero, he sent them a copy of Polly Jean Harvey's second album Rid Of Me.\n\n\"Kurt told me very specifically that he thought Polly's voice was great on those recordings,\" Albini told SPIN magazine in 2013. \"He was a fan.\"\n\nIt's easy to trace a sonic line between the two albums. Rid Of Me is easily the toughest and most intimidating PJ Harvey has ever sounded. It's a bracing, feminist statement where the band's punk thrashing is augmented by Albini's abrasive, stormy work behind the desk.\n\n\"I really wanted that very bare, very real sound. I knew that it would suit the songs,\" Harvey said. \"It's like touching real objects or feeling the grain of wood. That's what his sound is like to me. It's very tangible. You can almost feel the room.\"\n\nThe bulk of the album was knocked out in three days, giving an intensity to the likes of the burly 50ft Queenie and the searing Man-Size.\n\nHis approach was \"to set the band up completely and let them perform normally, then record as it happened.\"\n\nIt's easier said than done but the no-nonsense results speak for themselves.\n\nOn the unsettling, cool-as-f**k title track it's as if you can hear Harvey stalking the studio. Impossibly, she hisses \"Lick my legs, I'm on fire\", from behind while battering you from the front: \"Don't you wish, you never, never met her?\"\n\nOne of Albini's longest standing relationships was with The Jesus Lizard, who first teamed up with the engineer when they moved to Chicago in the late 1980s.\n\n\"If I had to place money for who is the best rock band in the world right now, it would be The Jesus Lizard in all categories,\" Albini told Richard Kingsmill on triple j in 1993.\n\nOn Goat, the band's second album, the band's tense and ferocious brand of noise-rock cuts deep. The sneering attitude of David Yow's expressive voice the perfect complement to the band's rumbling rhythm section and searing guitar.\n\nHis work with this band no doubt helped Albini link up with bands of a similar ilk, with everyone from The Mark Of Cain to Fugazi to Mclusky choosing to enlist Albini to help them make records with a similar menace.\n\nWhile he loved their music and live show, Albini was equally as impressed with the band as people, believing they had the foresight to ensure a strong independent future by learning from bands who'd gone before them.\n\n\"The fact they've been so good for so long is just testament to the calibre of people they are really,\" he said.\n\n\"In the years they've been around, they've seen many bands that are their contemporaries sign to major labels and be destroyed by the process. They've learned from other people's mistakes.\"\n\nShellac only made six albums in the 30 years they were together (their sixth, To All Trains, is out this Friday) but every one of them was a brilliantly pummelling display of terrifying rock'n'roll.\n\nLike much of the music Albini made as a musician, 1000 Hurts is both proficient and primal. While the sinewy three-piece lock in together with apparent ease, the noise they make is constantly tense and often abrasive.\n\nLyrically, Albini's anger and sadness is palpable as he processes the death of his mother, and dreams about revenge, making for plenty of uncomfortable moments.\n\nSavages front woman Jehnny Beth says it was 1000 Hurts that made her want to become a bassist, and that she learnt how to play the whole album from start to finish.\n\n\"I love everything about Shellac,\" she told Uncut magazine in May 2020.\n\n\"I've heard a lot about Steve Albini and how he records music: the idea is that it's a performance, and if you capture something that's unique then you will sound unique.\"\n\nLong before he became Nick Cave's closest collaborator, Warren Ellis was the weirdy, beardy violinist out front of Dirty Three, conjuring electric instrumentals with guitarist Mick Turner\u202fand drummer\u202fJim White.\n\nCurrently back in action on tour with their first album in a decade, the group's recorded their fourth album, Ocean Songs, at Albini's Chicago studio, Electrical Audio.\n\nDuring the recording, \"Steve Albini gave me some words I live by\" Ellis recalled in an Instagram tribute to the famed production engineer.\n\n\"We were lost in the middle of recording and about to give up. We were trying to make a quiet album and we were anything but quiet,\" He wrote.\n\n\"Steve recognised the creative struggle. 'Don't forget what you came in here to do'. [The] album's existence as it is, is down to his advice in a fragile moment of doubt. I think of this advice most times I am in the studio. A gentleman and pleasure to work with.\"\n\nToning down their turbulent tempos and distorted violins for the first time, Ocean Songs instead ventures into the eye of the storm, upping the atmosphere in evocative, sometimes fragile music that expresses something words never could.\n\nWhile Dirty Three captain the ship, Albini's presence is felt in the stern and rudder, gently guiding and capturing three musicians at their most elemental, deeply tapped into crafting 'Authentic Celestial Music' -- as the album's centrepiece is titled.\n\nAlbini may have worked with several Australian acts -- The Mark of Cain, My Disco, Purplene and Sleepwalks among them -- but there's a reason Dirty Three is the first one people think of.\n\nOn paper, Ys seems like a record well outside Albini's raw, noisy wheelhouse. Joanna Newsom's ambitious second album is a collection of five lengthy orchestral folk pieces with lush arrangements from Van Dyke Parks and mixing by Jim O'Rourke.\n\nWhile Newsom enlisted producer Tim Boyle to record the backing orchestra, she chose Albini to commit her vocals and harp to tape.\n\n\"I was in this small room with Steve Albini and nobody else, and I was playing the songs exactly as they are, and it was a pretty intense time,\" she told The Wire in 2006.\n\n\"I had it candlelit, in the dark with just candles and conjuring up these pretty insane moments that I had been experiencing.\"\n\n\"My task was a really straightforward one,\" Albini told Mel Bampton on The Producers Series in 2007.\n\n\"I gotta say, she tore ass on that thing. She's one of the best musicians I've ever worked with. It's an unwieldy instrument, really difficult to control and she has that thing down.\"\n\nAlbini even got to try out a few new microphone techniques \"as a means of capturing all the subtleties of the instrument. It worked out pretty well, I was pleased.\"\n\nIndeed, Newsom's haunting presence and playing anchors the album's sweeping, symphonic compositions.\n\n\"It was a joy working on that record,\" Albini said. \"She's a terrific player, she sings like an angel, everything about it was great.\"\n\nThe feeling was mutual. Newsom later called Albini \"pretty much the best producer in the world\" and reunited with him for 2015's Divers.\n\nThe Cleveland band had released records before Attack On Memory but it was the first Cloud Nothings album that truly mattered, making multiple end of year lists.\n\nIt has all of Albini's fingerprints -- a spacious recording that sounds truly alive, making the dynamics all the more explosive -- but credit must go to frontman Dylan Baldi's nervy, hooky songwriting. His throat-shredding yelps and infectious riffs leap out at you.\n\nFrom moody opener 'No Future/No Past' to the triumphant 'Stay Useless' and epic, cathartic 'Wasted Days', the album is another stellar example of how Albini would just let a band play like they do live and allow us to bask in the raw, urgent afterglow of that synergy.\n\nThat famously hands off approach was quite literal.\n\n\"Steve Albini played Scrabble on Facebook almost the entire time [we were recording],\" Baldi told Pitchfork in 2012.\n\n\"He would alternate between that and writing on his food blog. I don't even know if he remembers what our album sounds like.\"\n\nIn a Reddit AMA, Albini explained it wasn't disinterest but a form of disciplined attention.\n\n\"When I first started making records I would sit in front of the console concentrating on the music every second. I found out the hard way that I tended to fiddle with things unnecessarily and records ended up sounding tweaked and weird. I developed a couple of techniques to avoid this, to keep me from messing with things while still paying attention enough to catch problems.\"\n\nIn any case, there was no hard feelings. Cloud Nothings reunited with Albini for 2020's The Black Hole Understands and were among the first acts to share an online tribute to the late, great producer.\n\nThe relationship between Albini and singer-songwriter Jason Molina was particularly special, evidenced in the way the engineer could make the singer's heart-wrenching songs sound as pained as the words on the page.\n\nThey first worked together on Molina's final album as Songs: Ohia, 2003's The Magnolia Electric Co., a classic album of beautiful yet tortured Americana that sounds like no one else.\n\n\"Just his natural talents were remarkable,\" Albini told the Better Yet podcast in 2019.\n\n\"He had a beautiful voice and a way with words that allowed you to imagine that the words meant far more than they actually did. His delivery, his choice of words, the imagery in his songs, all of it was unique to him.\"\n\nAlbini's hands-off approach gelled beautifully with Molina's way of working. The engineer understood that the musician was looking for something deeper than perfection.\n\n\"There is a class of artist that is more interested in surprising themselves and having the experience of discovery than they are in meticulously crafting something,\" Albini said.\n\n\"Someone like Bob Dylan, or Will Oldham, or Jason Molina, they're okay with it coming out bad. The whole point of it isn't to do something that is objectively good, the point is to do something that's meaningful on more than one level.\"", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news",

Here's a look at the stars we've lost so far in 2024, through April.\n\nSteve Albini, an acclaimed musician who helmed some of the most revered albums across America's alternative music scene, has died after suffering a heart attack at his recording studio. He was 61.\n\nStaff at the studio, Electrical Audio, have confirmed to Pitchfork that Albini died on Tuesday.\n\nThe late musician fronted bands such as Big Black, Rapeman and Shellac, while he also produced albums for the likes of Nirvana, Pixies, PJ Harvey, and Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.\n\nAlbini was heavily influenced by the punk movement during his younger years, and he ultimately founded his own music project called Big Black, firstly as a solo effort before it eventually became a quartet.\n\nThe group released their debut album, \"Atomizer\" in 1986, and they're now recognized as one of the most influential punk groups of the era.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Together, they released five albums and the group are actually scheduled to release their latest record, \"To All Trains,\" next week.\n\nAlbini is probably best know for producing the final studio album by Nirvana, \"In Utero,\" which was released in 1993.\n\nIn 1995, Albini established his own recording studio and he worked with several high-profile acts, including Joanna Newsom, Low, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Manic Street Preachers and Jarvis Cocker.\n\nAway from the music scene, Albini also enjoyed huge success as a poker player, winning two bracelets at World Series of Poker tournaments, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money.\n\nAlbini is survived by his wife, movie-maker Heather Whinna.\n\nPhotos: Notable deaths in 2024 Glynis Johns Adan Canto Bud Harrelson Dejan Milojevic Jack Burke Mary Weiss Norman Jewison Charles Osgood Melanie Safka Chita Rivera Carl Weathers Wayne Kramer Ian Lavender Toby Keith Henry Fambrough Bob Edwards Don Gullett Lefty Driesell Andreas Brehme Golden Richards Richard Lewis Nikolai Ryzhkov Brian Mulroney Akira Toriyama Iris Apfel Andy Russell Ed Ott Chris Mortensen Steve Lawrence Naomi Barber King Paul Alexander Thomas P.

Staff at Albini's recording studio Electrical Audio in Chicago confirmed to the publication that he died of a heart attack.\n\nAlbini has worked on over 1,500 records, famously refusing the title of \"producer\" for many of them and preferring instead to be credited simply as a recording engineer. Despite that modesty, some of the most popular rock acts of the 1990s -- including Nirvana, the Pixies, the Breeders, Bush, PJ Harvey and the Jesus Lizard owe him a huge debt of gratitude for his contributions to their albums.\n\nHe was famously outspoken, often weighing in and speaking out against the music industry's more unsavory aspects. Back in 2021, he addressed the ongoing debate over whether one can \"separate the art from the artist\" and support musicians or other celebrities who behave badly.\n\n\"Anybody who uses a position of power, status or authority to exploit people who are vulnerable to that power, status or authority is dead to me,\" he said. \"I don't care what kind of movies a rapist makes, don't care if other people think they're good, they're rapist movies and I'm not watching them. I have limited attention to lend to other people's art, and I get to choose who deserves it. I'll admit I laughed at Bill Cosby's humor before I knew what a monster he was. Never since. Those Spanish Fly jokes just hit different now. I've never had a problem with transgressive art, but it sure seems like you can tell when it's just a veneer used to justify being a fucking creep. Always hated Vice, still hate it. Just a parade of gawkers reveling in whatever misery they can observe from an ironic distance. Fuck that shit completely.\"\n\nAt the time of his death, Albini was gearing up to tour with Shellac behind their first new album in a decade, To All Trains, which is out next week. No word yet on whether the surviving members of the band will tour without him. Stay tuned for more news as we get it, and in the meantime, give Nirvana's In Utero or the Pixies' Surfer Rosa a spin today in his honor.", "source": {"uri": "insidehook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InsideHook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shellac (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_Audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrical Audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Black", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitchfork_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitchfork (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Memorial_Sports_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recording studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_vocalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lead vocalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pixies (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_Lizard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Jesus Lizard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breeders", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Breeders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ_Harvey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PJ Harvey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cosby", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Cosby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-596876860.jpg?resize=1198,800", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-08-27", "textStart": 94, "textEnd": 109}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Effectively, it's Albini responding to Kurt Cobain's request to produce the album by saying, \"Only if we do it right.\"\n\n\"I think the very best thing you could do at this point is exactly what you are talking about doing: bang a record out in a couple of days, with high quality but minimal 'production' and no interference from the front office bulletheads. If that is indeed what you want to do, I would love to be involved,\" he wrote. \"If, instead, you might find yourselves in the position of being temporarily indulged by the record company, only to have them yank the chain at some point (hassling you to rework songs/sequences/production, calling-in hired guns to \"sweeten\" your record, turning the whole thing over to some remix jockey, whatever...) then you're in for a bummer and I want no part of it.\"\n\nHe goes on to write that he's \"only interested in working on records that legitimately reflect the band's own perception of their music and existence\" and that \"if a record takes more than a week to make, somebody's fucking up.\"\n\nThough Nirvana agreed to his stipulations prior to recording, Albini's prediction of the studio pressuring the band to rework the subsequent recordings eventually came to fruition. Nirvana's label, Geffen, remixed the singles \"Heart-Shaped Box\" and \"All Apologies\" and gave the rest of the record a remaster that Albini was less than fond of.\n\nElsewhere in the letter, Albini touches on his famous business practice of refusing royalties, instead only accepting a one-time upfront fee for his services. \"I would like to be paid like a plumber,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I do not want and will not take a royalty on any record I record. No points. Period. I think paying a royalty to a producer or engineer is ethically indefensible. The band write the songs. The band play the music. It's the band's fans who buy the records. The band is responsible for whether it's a great record or a horrible record. Royalties belong to the band.\"\n\nIn October 2023, Albini reconnected with Nirvana members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic on the Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend podcast to celebrate the 30th anniversary of In Utero. Notably, Albini expands on the letter and his intentions behind it.\n\nRead the full letter below.

He was 61.\n\nAccording to reports, Albini suffered the fatal cardiac arrest around 10:30 PM. He died instantly. The pioneering figure leaves behind a legacy as one of music's most respected and iconoclastic voices.\n\nBorn in 1962 in Pasadena, California, Albini founded the highly influential noise rock band Big Black in the early 80s while a student at Northwestern University. He went on to front the abrasive Rapeman before forming Shellac in 1992 with Bob Weston and Todd Trainer.\n\nAlbini's impact was also felt behind the recording console. As founder of Electrical Audio studio, he brought his unvarnished, high-fidelity approach to capturing visceral rock recordings by working with a who's-who of left-field artists like Nirvana, Pixies, The Breeders, Bush, Slint, Neurosis, and many more.\n\nHis work on Nirvana's In Utero, which he aimed to record with an aggressive, unembellished sound against the band's label's wishes, became a landmark for its rawness. Albini's outspoken opposition to the bloated music industry made him a cult hero among anti-establishment musicians seeking an engineer who prioritized artistic integrity over commercial interests.\n\n\"Steve was such a giving person,\" says Maureen Herman, the bassist for Babes in Toyland and a longtime friend. \"He was always quick to help out a friend or anyone in need without judgement or condition -- and that was me at times. My daughter worked at his studio as an intern and she has been amazed at his work ethic and process and was learning so much from him. He is not someone that can be replaced. It's a stunning loss on many levels.\"\n\nAlbini also found success as a professional poker player, winning two World Series of Poker bracelets. In 2018, he won the $1,500 Seven Card Stud event, and followed it up in 2022 by winning the $1,500 H.O.R.S.E tournament for $196,089.

What Have They Done To Deserve This?\n\nIf all Steve Albini ever did with music was complain about it, he still would have reigned as one of its most brilliant provocateurs. But Albini came to make noise -- as a punk guitarist, as a producer, as a writer -- with rock's most notoriously savage sense of humor. \"I like noise,\" he declared in a hugely influential 1986 manifesto in the fanzine Forced Exposure. \"I like big-ass vicious noise that makes my head spin. I wanna feel it whipping through me like a fucking jolt. We're so dilapidated and crushed by our pathetic existence we need it like a fix.\"\n\nSteve Albini always brought that noise, in his bands Big Black and Shellac, in his razorblade production on classics by Nirvana, PJ Harvey, and the Pixies. That's why the world is so shocked by the terrible news of his death Wednesday, only 61, of a heart attack. It doesn't seem real because he seemed built to outlast everyone. Albini made his name as an angry young man -- the \"Thin White Dick,\" as Forced Exposure called him. Yet he aged into a surprisingly wise elder statesman, a model for how to outgrow your own bullshit. We all expecting many more years of Steve Albini being a brilliant pain in the ass.\n\nAlbini lived by his own fiercely stubborn code of punk DIY ethics. His bands always set up their own gear onstage. Once at a Shellac gig in Brooklyn, the club tried to give them a little rock-star allure by cranking up the fog machine. Albini told them to knock it off, snapping, \"We're an anti-fog band.\"\n\nHe refused to take points for producing Nirvana's In Utero, which would have been standard industry practice, passing up a fortune on principle. At his Electrical Audio studio in Chicago, he took pride in wearing work overalls. But he never learned his manners. A typical Albini joke onstage: \"What's orange and looks good on a hippie? Fire.\"\n\nHe got his start as a fanzine brat, making enemies all over Chicago with his rants in the zine Matter. Nobody was funnier or nastier at trashing bands they hated, and Albini hated nearly all of them, especially if his friends were in them. But he had a guitar sound to match in the pavement-saw buzz of Big Black, in noise omelettes like Atomizer and Songs About Fucking. \"This is the brutal guitar machine thousands of lonely adolescent cowards have heard in their heads,\" the critic Robert Christgau wrote in the Village Voice. (That sounded 100 per cent accurate to me at the time, as a member of that tribe.) Their best-loved song was \"Kerosene,\" an ode to teen pyromania with the hook, \"Set me on fiiiire!\"\n\nWith his sociopathic stare and dork glasses, Albini became a cult hero around the same time as subway gunman Bernard Goetz, and not for totally dissimilar reasons. He made Big Black's debut EP Lungs alone in his room with his four-track, admitting, \"I wanted a real live band, but I couldn't find anybody who didn't blow out a pig's asshole.\" When they followed Atomizer with their Headache EP -- packaged in gruesome photos of a dead man with his head split open -- they added a sticker warning, \"Not as good as Atomizer, so don't get your hopes up, cheese.\" He ended Big Black at the peak of their notoriety, explaining, \"Hey, breaking up is an idea that's occured to far too few bands. Sometimes the wrong ones.\"\n\nThere was a lot to hate about this guy. He enjoyed talking about serial killers, slaughterhouses, child sex predators, any variety of bloodshed or torture. He relished racist, misogynist shock-horror humor, making the usual corny excuses about mainstream hypocrisy. But over the years, to his credit, he took himself to task in public. \"I'm overdue for a conversation about my role in inspiring 'edgelord' shit,\" he wrote in a viral 2021 social-media thread. \"A lot of things I said and did from an ignorant position of comfort and privilege are clearly awful and I regret them.\"\n\nBut he didn't evolve in a \"that was a different era\" way, or an \"I was another person then\" way. He came to despise his earlier excuses as a fog machine he needed to turn off. \"The one thing I don't want to do is say: 'The culture shifted - excuse my behavior,'\" he told the Guardian last year. \"It provides a context for why I was wrong at the time, but I was wrong at the time.\"\n\nAlbini was a lifelong enemy of the major labels, even in the Nineties grunge gold rush. He laid it all out in his most famous broadside, \"The Problem With Music,\" published in The Baffler in 1993. Anyone can find now online, but at the time, it was something people Xeroxed, paper-clipped, and sent via snail-mail to their friends, who then Xeroxed it for their friends. He broke down the math of a major-label contract, and why it was a sucker bet where the house always wins. In his cautionary tale, the band signs a sweet-looking deal, with expenses from \"Recording Budget: $150,000\" to \"New fancy potato-shaped bass guitar: $1,000.\" After they sell a quarter-million albums, \"the band members have each earned about 1/3 as much as they would working at a 7-11, but they got to ride in a tour bus for a month.\" Yet for all their sales, they're still massively in debt to the label, trapped in this contract. He concludes with the ominous and oft-quoted words, \"Some of your friends are already this fucked.\"\n\nHe was an in-demand producer, although he despised the whole idea of producers. As he wrote in 1990, \"When I am hired to record a band, I make it plain to my clients that I do not wish to be associated with their charming little records.\" Instead, he claimed to want anonymity. \"When I was employed as a photo retoucher, I was often involved in the alteration of reality for the noble purpose of increasing cigarette sales. Not once did I expect or desire to see 'produced by Steve Albini' on a Marlboro ad, simply because it was this, and not some poor other sap, who toned down the excessive lipgloss on Darryl's pout or removed the unfortunate sarcoma from his forehead. I apply the same logic to my current occupation.\"\n\nBut his production career exploded with the Pixies' Surfer Rosa. He gave them a raw room-tone live crunch, especially the heavy drums and slashing guitars. Despite his overall hostility to singers, he had a soft spot for Kim Deal's flat Midwestern tone, and they became lifelong friends. (It was definitely a trip to hear Kim Deal last month in a sold-out Madison Square Garden, as The Breeders opened for Olivia Rodrigo, bashing out the utterly unknown Albini-produced deep cut \"When I Was A Painter\" for an arena full of curious girls. Now that's the pop-punk process at its best and weirdest.)\n\nNirvana went to Albini for a taste of his sonic kerosene on In Utero -- a highlight of both their careers. He also produced PJ Harvey's 1993 classic Rid Of Me. As he reported, in his later phase as a foodie, \"Polly Harvey ate nothing but potatoes, with occasional sauces, during the entire recording of her Rid of Me album.\" A divisive production -- fans accused him of muffling her voice -- yet it was exactly what she wanted. \"Polly's playing is incredible but the sound is amazing,\" drummer Robert Ellis said. \"Jimmy Page would be jealous.\" [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/pj-harveys-rid-of-me-at-25-a-salute-to-her-funniest-nastiest-masterpiece-628969/] Maybe Page was, since he and Robert Plant hired Albini a few years later for their best post-Zep collabo, Walking Into Clarksdale.\n\nAlbini loathed pop music, yet so many of us who loved pop also loved Albini as a crucial part of it, because his unfakeable enthusiasm was the essence of true pop fandom -- you love what you love, you hate what you hate, no waffling or soft-soaping allowed. He was a true believer, Casey Kasem's evil twin. He adored the Swans the way I adored Miami Sound Machine. What he opposed was the idea of hearing music without taking it personally -- without looking for that jolt whipping through you. In a 1987 Village Voice screed, he jeered, \"Shitheads write about whatever is presented to them, non-judgmentally treating all styles of music as equals, distinguished from each other only by superficial stylistic elements.\" That he couldn't abide. That's why pop heads could relate to Albini -- his whole point was, whatever it is you love, go ahead and be an irresponsible asshole fanatic about it.\n\nAn Eighties critic cleverly compared Big Black to the \"multiplatinum pap smear\" Whitney Houston: \"The Greatest Love of All vs. The Greatest Hate of All: equally contrived, equally vacuous, equally false.\" A clever putdown, yet I read it and thought \"this must be why I love both of them.\" Albini, like Whitney, really just cared about letting it rip; they enjoyed overstatement for its own sake. They were both in it for that jolt. \"Set me on fiiiiire!\" was just a noisier way to say \"I wanna feel the heeeeeat with somebody!\"\n\nThat's also why pop aesthetes often made great records with Albini, from the band Bush (\"Swallowed\" is a goddamn Nineties classic) to Jarvis Cocker, the Britpop god of Pulp. \"When I recorded the Further Complications album with Steve Albini in Chicago,\" Cocker told me in 2020, \"he asked my favorite kind of music. I said pop music. He was like, what the hell? Obviously I realized it was the wrong thing to say, because to Steve Albini, pop music is the exploitative capitalist system which will suck all the truth out of artistic expression. And I get his point -- it's an industry, it's a business -- but...to me, that was where music really happened.\"\n\nEven as the stakes got high and the weird turned pro, Albini didn't change his tune. One mega-obscure band he couldn't shut up about was the Didjits, Chicago jokers nobody else seemed to care as much about. In 1994, they got one of their songs covered by The Offspring, on the mega-platinum hit Smash -- a surprise windfall. According to Albini, the band tried to pay him a \"tip\" for his loud support over the years. \"Of course I didn't accept,\" he noted, but couldn't resist pointing out that if the Didjits had been dumb enough to sign a publishing deal, they never would have gotten a cent of the money.\n\nHe thrived in media that was instant, temporary, good for a hit-and-run quickie polemic. He became brilliant at the Internet, the same way he was once brilliant at zines. In the Nineties, he dropped science on the indie-rock insider listserv Chugchanga, insulting artists (\"Suzanne Vega + the word 'fuck' = Liz Phair\") and making fun of Steely Dan. In the 2020s he took to Twitter, insulting Republicans (\"You are my enemy and can get fucked\") and making fun of Steely Dan. \"History can judge Trump, sure,\" he wrote. \"But first we get to play football with his head.\" It was bracing to see the guy who wrote \"Il Duce\" add, \"He wants to be Mussolini, he gets to be Mussolini.\"\n\nSocial media was a good place for him to evolve in public and face up to the asshole he used to be. He had a lot to answer for. After Big Black, he called his next band Rapeman (I'm told they had a great guitar sound -- never could bring myself to listen.). \"I can't defend any of it,\" he told the Guardian in 2023. \"It was all coming from a privileged position of someone who would never have to suffer any of the hatred that's embodied in any of that language.\"\n\nIt's complex because he wrote so many powerful songs about misogyny, sung in the voices of misogynist male characters. Shellac's best-known song is \"Prayer To God,\" where he asks the Lord to kill his ex (painlessly) and her new man (painfully). \"Make him cry like a woman / No particular woman,\" Albini prays, repeating the words \"fucking kill him\" dozens of times. (One of my wife's favorite karaoke songs.)\n\n\"I try to be an ally in feminism,\" he said last year in a essential interview with Evelyn Morris for the online zine Listen.\n\nThis song \"examines the different facets of impotent male rage,\" he says. \"It's repellent or comic depending on your mood, and uncomfortably familiar to most men. That discomfort is maybe the reason to do it.\" As he saw it, he was exposing the kind of misogyny he despised, because he knew it from the inside. \"As for men, boys and other dudes, I feel like I can voice many of those perspectives without invention, and while I'm not about to speak for women, men are fair game, including the way they deal with women.\"\n\nOn Big Black's final record, in the liner notes, Albini warned, \"Slowly, without trying, everyone becomes what he despises most.\" But surprisingly, to many, this did not happen to him. He aged gracefully, obsessed with billiards, baseball, and fine dining. He became a champion at the World Series of Poker. With his wife Heather Whinna, he became a formidable philanthropist on behalf of Chicago's unhoused and impoverished.\n\nShellac made a longtime habit of playing All Tomorrow's Parties festivals, where he would set up a poker room to make dough in his downtime. Between sets, fans could enjoy the honor of sitting down at the table to lose their shirts to the guy who produced \"Milk It.\" But no lurkers allowed. If you casually popped into the room, to eavesdrop or merely loiter, maybe pretend you were making up your mind, he had a business-like way of transfixing you with his eyes and asking \"Are you in?\" in in a tone that made it clear \"nope, just watching you make other people look like fools\" was not going to cut it. That was always his approach to music as well. He always knew how to clear a room. Requiescat, Steve Albini.

Here's a look at the stars we've lost so far in 2024, through April.\n\nSteve Albini, an acclaimed musician who helmed some of the most revered albums across America's alternative music scene, has died after suffering a heart attack at his recording studio. He was 61.\n\nStaff at the studio, Electrical Audio, have confirmed to Pitchfork that Albini died on Tuesday.\n\nThe late musician fronted bands such as Big Black, Rapeman and Shellac, while he also produced albums for the likes of Nirvana, Pixies, PJ Harvey, and Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.\n\nAlbini was heavily influenced by the punk movement during his younger years, and he ultimately founded his own music project called Big Black, firstly as a solo effort before it eventually became a quartet.\n\nThe group released their debut album, \"Atomizer\" in 1986, and they're now recognized as one of the most influential punk groups of the era.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Together, they released five albums and the group are actually scheduled to release their latest record, \"To All Trains,\" next week.\n\nAlbini is probably best know for producing the final studio album by Nirvana, \"In Utero,\" which was released in 1993.\n\nIn 1995, Albini established his own recording studio and he worked with several high-profile acts, including Joanna Newsom, Low, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Manic Street Preachers and Jarvis Cocker.\n\nAway from the music scene, Albini also enjoyed huge success as a poker player, winning two bracelets at World Series of Poker tournaments, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money.\n\nAlbini is survived by his wife, movie-maker Heather Whinna.\n\nPhotos: Notable deaths in 2024 Glynis Johns Adan Canto Bud Harrelson Dejan Milojevic Jack Burke Mary Weiss Norman Jewison Charles Osgood Melanie Safka Chita Rivera Carl Weathers Wayne Kramer Ian Lavender Toby Keith Henry Fambrough Bob Edwards Don Gullett Lefty Driesell Andreas Brehme Golden Richards Richard Lewis Nikolai Ryzhkov Brian Mulroney Akira Toriyama Iris Apfel Andy Russell Ed Ott Chris Mortensen Steve Lawrence Naomi Barber King Paul Alexander Thomas P.

Written by the journalist Michael Azerrad, Our Band Could Be Your Life was a study of the 1980s independent-music landscape -- of bands who had unconsciously responded to the commercialism found on MTV and mainstream rock radio by going underground, and by getting very weird. The book introduced me to groups such as Black Flag, Dinosaur Jr., and the Replacements, the last of which had beer-drunk songwriting and electric punk-rock hooks that soon made it my favorite band. These groups had never become traditionally successful, Azzerad explained, but their careers represented a romantic and uncompromising approach to making music, which could too easily become cheapened by external forces.\n\nAnd in fact, many of the bands in the book had attempted to move up a level by signing to major labels, only to hit an artificial ceiling once it became clear that they couldn't look or sound a certain way. But some of them had not even attempted this -- they had recognized, as their careers were taking shape, that their personal beliefs were permanently at odds with the idea of participating in a notoriously predatory and corporate music industry. Among them -- and the band that left the strongest impression on me -- was a band called Big Black. Big Black was, even by the standards of its contemporaries, particularly abrasive; its serrated riffs and pummeling drumbeats sounded like they'd been recorded on the floor of an automobile factory. And the band's philosophical stances were just as belligerent as its sound: It was led by a guitarist and singer named Steve Albini who seemed to take particular joy in broadcasting how he thought artists should behave, and denigrating everyone who did not live up to his standards. As Azerrad put it, \"This was a band with policies.\" Proving its ideological commitment, Big Black broke up in 1987 right after its best record came out -- partly because one of the members wanted to attend law school, and also because the band was becoming a little too popular, which meant it was attracting the wrong kind of fans.\n\nBut Albini, who died yesterday at the age of 61 from a heart attack, did not stop making music. Over the next few decades, he continued to perform in his own bands and struck up a second career as a recording engineer (his preferred term, over producer), where he worked with hundreds of artists -- among them Nirvana, the Pixies, PJ Harvey, Slint, Joanna Newsom, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, the Jesus Lizard, and many, many, many more. It's no exaggeration to say that Albini changed the trajectory of rock music for the better. He was especially good at capturing an artist as though they were playing right in front of you, a product of chemistry and ability rather than studio-driven artifice, and hiring Albini became a way for bands to signal their interest in being \"realer,\" both in sound and in attitude. His own outlook was perhaps best crystallized in his 1993 essay for The Baffler, \"The Problem With Music,\" where he meticulously sketched out all the reasons why making music on a major label was a sucker's game. This idea, and its attendant aesthetic principles, felt just as important as the records themselves; to a certain kind of listener, it sometimes seemed like Albini was the last honest musician in the industry, though he would've shaken his head at such mythologizing.\n\nI feel confident saying this because, in the summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to profile Albini for The Guardian, and I interviewed him on multiple occasions in Chicago, where he spent most of his life. I did not approach this task lightly. Foremost was the fact that I'd been listening to his music for the past 20 years and didn't want to seem like some fawning kid. But Albini had also incurred a reputation for being personally combative -- which is saying something, given that inveterate punk rockers are not always known for their social graces. Over the years, he'd become infamous for saying a tremendous number of insulting things about other people, including bands he'd worked with. (\"Never have I seen four cows more anxious to be led around by their nose rings,\" he once wrote about the Pixies.) He seemed terribly smart, and suspicious of any nonsense. This is a bit of a broad statement, but allow me to say it: Anyone who has spent time around people who are really into music has met the type of person who seems totally obstinate, and borderline caustic, about why the bands they like are better than the bands you like. These people can be pretty irritating -- I don't want to be yelled at just because I like some Taylor Swift songs -- but they inspire a shard of dread that perhaps their obstinacy is justified, that they have latched onto some way of thinking about art that the rest of us are too dull to perceive.\n\nFrom afar, Albini seemed like the final boss of this mindset. Yet the Guardian profile had been assigned because Albini, in recent years, had begun to soften some of his adversarial instincts, at least in public. He still got worked up about bands he hated (especially Steely Dan) and about right-wing politicians -- but he had explicitly apologized for the numerous offensive things he'd said throughout his life, which included using racial slurs and denigrating women. \"A lot of things I said and did from an ignorant position of comfort and privilege are clearly awful and I regret them,\" he wrote in a 2021 Twitter thread that went viral. This felt notable because it's become popular, in recent years, for people to complain about the rise of cancel culture and the shifting standards for public speech. In the past, Albini had always claimed that his offensiveness was attached to some underlying principle, no matter how arbitrary it seemed to others, but he'd since become suspicious of the people who reveled in offensiveness for its own sake. \"When you realize that the dumbest person in the argument is on your side, that means you're on the wrong side,\" he had told me about recalibrating his feelings.\n\nSo this was one dimension of the Albini I met: A man who, while still razor-sharp and hilarious, was clear-eyed about why he felt he should shed some of these more reactive traits of his former self. \"It's me owning up to my role in a shift in culture that directly caused harm to people I'm sympathetic with, and people I want to be a comrade to,\" he said of why he had decided to be open about his evolved thinking. When I published the story, quite a few readers, and particularly men of his generation, said they were personally inspired by Albini's perspective and growth -- that if someone with his cutting reputation could be this reflective, then perhaps nobody else had an excuse for staying rude.\n\nJust as striking, to me, was the way he talked about his job. Earlier in his career, he had been more insistent about how a record should sound, and had freely offered his opinions in the studio. Over time, he sloughed off this tendency and became more comfortable with recording musicians as they were, and as they wanted to be. His rates remained affordable, and he was always personally available to record a band; for a reasonable fee, a local artist could get the guy who'd laid down Kurt Cobain's guitar on \"All Apologies.\" He relished working with musicians \"beneath the professional level,\" as he put it to me -- people for whom making music was part of a necessary impulse rather than any means of getting rich or famous. He was decidedly not sentimental about the famous artists he'd worked with (though he got a little giddy when we talked about Iggy Pop and the Stooges, whose reunion record he'd recorded). Instead, it was the everyday work of going to his studio and producing physical evidence of a band's existence -- no matter how big or small -- that mattered the most. His greatest contribution to music, Kim Deal of the Pixies told me while I was reporting for the profile, was \"every single person who has walked through that door and been treated with respect about their ideas.\"\n\nAlbini did too much to be neatly summarized in any profile; I didn't have the space in mine to dive too deeply into his most recent band, Shellac, who in a terrible coincidence is releasing a new record next week. But as I drafted, two things kept coming back to me: The first was that he had been unafraid to own up to his past rather than wave it off or double down on his positions. The second was that he talked about music not as some expression of ego but as a creative practice worth maintaining because it enriched your life.

But he also stood for an ethos.\n\nFamous among rock fans for his work in the recording studio with the likes of Nirvana and the Pixies -- and for his own bands Shellac and Big Black -- Albini was known for harsh guitars and booming drums presented with none of the sweetening that can make a rock record sound like a candyland. As a producer (though he preferred to be called an engineer), he took a \"documentary approach to recording music,\" he told The Times in 1993, not long after he oversaw the making of Nirvana's final studio album, \"In Utero.\"\n\nYet Albini, who died Tuesday at age 61, was almost equally revered for his straightforward criticisms of the record industry and its propensity to corrupt the purity of creative expression. To him, stardom was a trap, which is one reason he was known for years to record virtually any band that asked him to at his studio in Chicago. What he offered musicians was wisdom, honesty and technical know-how; what he got out of his clients more often than not was some of their best work. Here, in the order they were released, are 12 of Albini's essential recordings.\n\n1. Big Black, \"Kerosene\" (1986)\n\nA would-be arsonist explains himself -- his motive: boredom -- as slashing guitars scrape against the mechanized thump of a Roland drum machine. No Big Black, no Nine Inch Nails.\n\n2. Pixies, \"Where Is My Mind?\" (1988)\n\n\"Never have I seen four cows more anxious to be led around by their nose rings,\" Albini famously wrote after recording the debut album by this seminal alt-rock quartet. Yet even now nothing sounds quite like the Pixies' most enduring tune: a haunted psychedelic-soul jam in which the ultra-reverbed backing vocals conjure the terrifying underwater expanse that singer Black Francis describes in his lyric. Thanks in part to a prominent placement in 1999's \"Fight Club,\" \"Where Is My Mind?\" has been streamed more than 850 million times on Spotify.\n\n3. The Breeders, \"Iris\" (1990)\n\nClearly unbothered by the nose-ring comment, the Pixies' Kim Deal drafted Albini to oversee the first record by her other band, and it's not hard to see why: No one ever showcased the feral beauty of Deal's singing like he did.", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Black", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Big Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pixies (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shellac (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recording studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drum kit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trap music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Is_My_Mind?", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Where Is My Mind?"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iris (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Deal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breeders", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Breeders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Inch_Nails", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nine Inch Nails"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drum machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam_session", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jam session"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backing_vocalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Backing vocalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alternative rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/288/28866/2886639.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"In that interview, he said, 'I'd charge Depeche Mode $1 million, but I'd do Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet for free,'\" Pyle recalled this week.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Of course, everybody started contacting us, saying, 'Wow, oh my God! Did you see this?'\"\n\nIn fact, Albini -- who died Tuesday night from a heart attack at age 61 -- did indeed record the instrumental rockers right after he completed the \"In Utero\" sessions.\n\nBut for free? No: Shadowy Men paid for the own sessions that eventually resulted in the trio's sophomore album, \"Sport Fishin': The Lure of the Bait, The Luck of the Hook.\"\n\nThe Shadowy Men -- perhaps best remembered for the Kids In The Hall theme song -- decided to work with Albini because he was an admirer.\n\n\"We first met him from him sending us a fan letter,\" Pyle remembered. \"When we arrived to record with him (in Chicago) the first time, it was U.S. Thanksgiving and he had made a full Thanksgiving dinner. He was an amazing gourmet chef, and he was so generous and gracious and helpful. He was a lot of fun. He was smart-ass, kind of like we were, with a similar sense of humour and just made everything easy and effortless.\"\n\nWhile he engineered the albums of many popular artists in his customized Chicago studio Electrical Audio -- Bush, Cheap Trick, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant among them -- Albini carved his reputation with his organic approach of recording underground indie acts such as Chicago post-hardcore rockers Tar; Kentucky indie rockers Slint and New York punk blues rockers Boss Hog.\n\nAlbini, also a professional poker champion, was a principled rebel: a Goliath in the underground music scene who treated each of the hundreds of artists he recorded with respect, dignity and a refusal to financially exploit them, especially when he was hired under the auspices of \"producer.\"\n\n\"He really hated the term 'producer,'\" said Alan Cross, host of the popular radio program \"The Ongoing History of New Music.\" \"He preferred the term 'engineer' or 'recorder.'\n\n\"Steve believed that when a band came to see him, it was his job to capture their vision as accurately as he possibly could without imposing his ideas or motives on the act. He felt that wasn't his place.\n\n\"He was not a producer in the traditional sense.\"\n\nCross said Albini also railed against the standard industry practice of taking a back-end royalty percentage of sales.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"He wouldn't: he would charge a flat fee,\" Cross said.\n\nThere's a published letter written to Nirvana band members Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl by Albini before his work on \"In Utero\" that states his payment philosophy.\n\n\"I think paying a royalty to a producer or engineer is ethically indefensible,\" Albini wrote. \"The band writes the songs. The band plays the music. It's the band's fans who buy the records. The band is responsible for whether it's a great record or a horrible record. Royalties belong to the band.\n\n\"I would like to be paid like a plumber: I do the job and you pay me what it's worth.\"\n\nAs much as he worked on landmark albums by Nirvana, the Pixies (1988's \"Surfer Rosa\") and P.J. Harvey (1991's \"Rid Of Me\") he also loved plenty of Canadian bands, engineering projects ranging from Montreal post rockers Godspeed You! Black Emperor to Toronto rock and country outfit the Sadies.\n\nToronto punk band Metz hired him for 2017's \"Strange Peace\" and lead vocalist Alex Edkins said in a statement to the Star that the band was \"deeply saddened\" by Albini's passing.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"His influence on underground music is impossible to put into words,\" Edkins wrote. \"His approach to making records/music was an inspiration to so many and his body of work is truly second to none. He was infamously acerbic and outspoken, uncompromising and deeply funny. It was very easy to think of Steve as an elitist crank know-it-all, and he definitely was that, but at his core Steve was an extremely generous and kind soul whose work did unmeasurable good and brought unforeseen beauty into the world. He will be missed.\"\n\nAlbini oversaw KEN Mode's 2015 album \"Success\" and Jesse Matthewson of the Winnipeg hardcore band said meeting Albini \"was one of those instances where meeting your hero exceeds the expectation.\"\n\nVeteran singer/songwriter Joel Plaskett was also touched by the Albini magic during the '90s when Plaskett was fronting Halifax rockers Thrush Hermit.\n\n\"He was a really incredible force both as a person and in his productions,\" Plaskett said of Albini.\n\nThe band met him through a mutual friend and recorded in the basement of his Chicago house for three days.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"I think of him as a documentarian engineer with a real esthetic,\" said Plaskett. \"He really wasn't making production suggestions ... he was just making jokes a lot. But he was out of the way and yet also present in the way he worked.\"\n\nPerhaps one of Albini's closest Canadian friendships and working relationships was with Shadowy Men's Pyle, which encompassed other projects like surf-rock instrumental band Phono-Comb and indie rock band King Cobb Steelie. Pyle also assisted Albini in engineering \"The Sadies in Concert Vol. 1.\"\n\nPyle said Albini worked quickly and efficiently.\n\n\"Pretty much all the bands that did stuff with him, they were quick,\" Pyle said. \"Our first recordings with him ... we were at his home studio, (we) did four or five songs in two days. We had to be superefficient as well, because we were on a tight budget, but it was definitely one of the things that he liked about us, because we were tight; we were rehearsed, we were together and we weren't high. We would hear stories about his impatience with bands who were doing drugs in the studio.\"\n\nAs it happens, Albini did eventually work with Depeche Mode.\n\n\"Depeche Mode did actually ask him to record them and he didn't want to do it,\" Pyle said. \"So he asked them for $1 million. And they agreed.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_krewen@thestar.com", "name": "Nick Krewen", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Preferring the term \"recording engineer\" to \"producer,\" he championed a style of elevated realism that remains as influential as the tracks he captured -- most famously drum-heavy albums by Nirvana, Pixies, PJ Harvey and the Jesus Lizard.\n\nThose sessions would define his career, but Albini, who died on Tuesday at 61, was loathe to say he had a \"sound.\" Bands of all D.I.Y. genres -- from the famous to the unknown -- converged on his Electrical Audio studio seeking what he really provided: an organic, authentic and honest representation of their work at a reasonable price.\n\nAlbini estimated he'd recorded \"a couple thousand\" albums in a 2018 interview; his productivity was related to the purity of his process. Albini sessions were done quickly and affordably. Instruments were recorded with room microphones to capture the natural reverberations of the space. Analogue gear and one-take recordings were preferred. \"Anyone who has made records for more than a very short period will recognize that trying to manipulate a sound after it has been recorded is never as effective as when it's recorded correctly in the first place,\" he told Sound on Sound magazine.\n\nHere are 10 songs that demonstrate his philosophy of the studio. (Listen on Apple Music or Spotify.)\n\nPixies, 'Where Is My Mind' (1988)\n\nFor the first record he recorded outside of his friend circle, Albini used the buzzy Boston band Pixies as lab animals for his sonic ideas: loading its debut album, \"Surfer Rosa,\" with off-the-cuff studio chatter, refusing to use silence in between songs and making the bassist Kim Deal sing the reverb-soaked background vocals on \"Where Is My Mind?\" in the studio's echo-y bathroom. In retrospect, Albini said his production touches were intrusive, but the next generation of alt-rock titans found them invigorating. \"'Where Is My Mind?'\" later became one of the records that other bands would reference when they wanted to work with me,\" he told The Guardian. \"Nobody expected it to take off because no underground American band of that generation had even a fleeting notion of commercial success as a goal. People just wanted to blow minds.\"\n\nThe Breeders, 'Happiness Is a Warm Gun' (1990)\n\nWhen Albini worked with Deal on her solo project the Breeders, \"I instantly preferred it to the Pixies,\" he said in the book \"Fool the World: The Oral History of a Band Called Pixies.\" \"There was a simultaneous charm to Kim's presentation to her music that's both childlike and giddy and also completely mature and kind of dirty.\" The band, often in pajamas, banged out its debut LP, \"Pod,\" in the first week of a two-week session. \"Steve Albini wasn't interested in 'perfecting' a song or a performance: His m\u00e9tier was getting the best sound from the equipment and pressing 'record,'\" the Breeders bassist Josephine Wiggs said in a 2008 news release. \"He was utterly pleased with himself when mixing the record, saying, 'Look -- no EQ!'\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Brian Fox, an engineer at Albini's studio, Electrical Audio Recording, confirmed the news of Albini's passing away, attributing it to a heart attack on Tuesday night\n\nSteve, known for his uncompromising approach to music production and his contributions to the underground music scene, leaves behind a profound legacy in the world of rock and roll.His impact on the music industry is immeasurable, with his work spanning across several iconic albums that have left an indelible mark on the genre.\n\nIn addition to his work behind the mixing board, Steve Albini was also a formidable musician in his own right, fronting the bands Big Black and Shellac. As the frontman of these groups, he brought his signature intensity and raw energy to the stage, earning acclaim for his abrasive guitar work and visceral vocal delivery.\n\nSteve's ethos as a producer was defined by his refusal to conform to industry norms. He famously rejected the title of \"producer\" and opted instead to be credited as \"Recorded by Steve Albini\" on the albums he worked on. He also eschewed royalties, preferring to focus on the craft of recording and the artistic integrity of the music itself.\n\nHis influence extended far beyond the realm of alternative rock, with acts like Joanna Newsom, the Breeders, the Jesus Lizard, and Mogwai also benefiting from his unique production style. Albini's dedication to authenticity and his commitment to the art of recording earned him a reputation as one of the most respected figures in the industry.\n\nRemembering the legend\n\nBorn in California and raised in Montana, Steve Albini found his musical calling in the vibrant punk scene of Chicago while studying journalism at Northwestern University. He emerged as a key figure in the city's underground music scene, founding the influential band Big Black and later establishing his renowned recording studio, Electrical Audio.\n\nThroughout his career, he remained a vocal critic of the music industry's commercialization and exploitation of artists. His seminal essay, 'The Problem with Music,' offered a scathing critique of the industry's practices and became required reading for aspiring musicians and industry professionals alike.\n\nApart from his musical legacy, Albini was recognized for his passion for poker and his sharp wit. His impact spans beyond music genres, inspiring musicians and fans across generations. Survived by his wife, filmmaker Heather Whinna, Albini's demise creates a profound void in the music world, ensuring his influence will resonate for years to come.\n\nThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

The latter was what launched him to fame in the 1980s.\n\nHis title of \"legend\" was earned mainly for producing iconic albums in rock history such as Surfer Rosa (1988) by the Pixies, which is commonly considered one of the most influential rock albums in history.\n\nThe experimental, lo-fi sound that Albini achieved with the Boston band was one of the biggest inspirations for Kurt Cobain in the creation of the album Nevermind (1991) and one of the reasons why he would sign the producer on his next project, In Uterus.\n\nWith titles like Pennyroyal Tea and Heart-Shaped Box and a harsh sound, In Utero became the number 1 album on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nAlbini is also responsible for albums such as Rid of Me, by PJ Harvey, and Walking Into Clarksdale, by former Led Zeppelin members Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, and the list of artists he worked with also includes The Breeders, The Jesus Lizard or Mclusky.\n\nHis death occurred just a week before the release of Shellac's first album in ten years, titled To All Trains, scheduled for May 17.\n\nPrimavera Sound has mourned the death of Albini on social media, where he had performed with Shellac on 15 occasions and was also scheduled to do so at this year's edition.\n\n\"We are speechless,\" begins the festival's writing. \"We have lost a music legend, but above all a friend. To a member of our family. \"And now what are we going to do without you, Steve?\" the text continues.\n\n\"After performing in 15 editions of the festival, it is very difficult for us to imagine a Primavera Sound without him because no band explains it to us better than Shellac. All our love for his family and friends\", concludes the contest, which will begin this coming May 29 in Barcelona.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pixies (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shellac (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Black", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Underground music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitchfork_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitchfork (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pasadena, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pasadena, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennyroyal_Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennyroyal Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart-Shaped_Box", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heart-Shaped Box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_and_Plant", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Page and Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lo-fi music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Led Zeppelin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billboard 200"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Experimental music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ_Harvey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PJ Harvey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Cobain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Cobain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mclusky", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mclusky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_Lizard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Jesus Lizard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breeders", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Breeders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primavera_Sound", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primavera Sound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums_and_Frames", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums and Frames", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_3bf58.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 1278, "textEnd": 1284}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-29", "textStart": 1937, "textEnd": 1943}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Among his most notable productions is Nirvana's third (and final) studio album In Utero, which was recorded in Minnesota over 30 years ago.\n\nNirvana was in a unique and stressful position following the smashing success of its 1991 album Nevermind, which sold over 30 million copies worldwide and catapulted the band into something beyond stardom.\n\nThe band needed to record a follow-up and was conflicted about its place in the world of popular music. While Nirvana went with producer Butch Vig for Nevermind, recording part of the album in Van Nuys, California and other parts at Vig's studio in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nKurt Cobain and his bandmates, bass player Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl, decided they wanted a more bare-bones sound for the follow-up, much to the chagrin of their record label. For this reason they chose to enlist punk rock producer Steve Albini to captain the ship.\n\nAlbini recommended the band record at Pachyderm Studios in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. The reasoning was that the band would be isolated and more engaged in the recording process. The group and Albini recorded the album in February of 1993.\n\n25 years ago this week, in Cannon Falls, MN...IN UTERO was recorded. Remember to play it loud.\n\nbyu/D74hruN inNirvana\n\nAlbini was known as an extremely principled producer, so when the band asked him to tweak the bass and vocal mix when the album had wrapped up recording, he refused. He was concerned about revisions being a slippery slope and besides, he liked the way the album sounded. While some of the songs on the album were given revisions, most remained true to Albini's vision. In addition, several \"Albini mixes\" were released on the album's 20th anniversary edition in 2013.", "source": {"uri": "river967.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "96.7 The River"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_overlund@river967.com", "name": "Dave Overlund", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Nuys", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Van Nuys"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Van Nuys"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Popular music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krist_Novoselic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Krist Novoselic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Grohl", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dave Grohl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butch_Vig", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Butch Vig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Cobain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Cobain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bass guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punk rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madison, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madison, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon_Falls,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannon Falls, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cannon Falls, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachyderm_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pachyderm Studios"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums_and_Frames", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums and Frames", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2021/08/attachment-Nirvana-Teen-Spirit-video.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

He was 61.\n\nStaff at the studio, Electrical Audio, have confirmed to Pitchfork that Albini died on Tuesday.\n\nThe late musician fronted bands such as Big Black, Rapeman and Shellac, while he also produced albums for the likes of Nirvana, Pixies, PJ Harvey, and Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.\n\nAlbini was heavily influenced by the punk movement during his younger years, and he ultimately founded his own music project called Big Black, firstly as a solo effort before it eventually became a quartet.\n\nThe group released their debut album, \"Atomizer\" in 1986, and they're now recognized as one of the most influential punk groups of the era.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Here's a look at the stars we've lost so far in 2024, through April.\n\nSteve Albini, an acclaimed musician who helmed some of the most revered albums across America's alternative music scene, has died after suffering a heart attack at his recording studio. He was 61.\n\nStaff at the studio, Electrical Audio, have confirmed to Pitchfork that Albini died on Tuesday.\n\nThe late musician fronted bands such as Big Black, Rapeman and Shellac, while he also produced albums for the likes of Nirvana, Pixies, PJ Harvey, and Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.\n\nAlbini was heavily influenced by the punk movement during his younger years, and he ultimately founded his own music project called Big Black, firstly as a solo effort before it eventually became a quartet.\n\nThe group released their debut album, \"Atomizer\" in 1986, and they're now recognized as one of the most influential punk groups of the era.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Together, they released five albums and the group are actually scheduled to release their latest record, \"To All Trains,\" next week.\n\nAlbini is probably best know for producing the final studio album by Nirvana, \"In Utero,\" which was released in 1993.\n\nIn 1995, Albini established his own recording studio and he worked with several high-profile acts, including Joanna Newsom, Low, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Manic Street Preachers and Jarvis Cocker.\n\nAway from the music scene, Albini also enjoyed huge success as a poker player, winning two bracelets at World Series of Poker tournaments, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money.\n\nAlbini is survived by his wife, movie-maker Heather Whinna.\n\nPhotos: Notable deaths in 2024 Glynis Johns Adan Canto Bud Harrelson Dejan Milojevic Jack Burke Mary Weiss Norman Jewison Charles Osgood Melanie Safka Chita Rivera Carl Weathers Wayne Kramer Ian Lavender Toby Keith Henry Fambrough Bob Edwards Don Gullett Lefty Driesell Andreas Brehme Golden Richards Richard Lewis Nikolai Ryzhkov Brian Mulroney Akira Toriyama Iris Apfel Andy Russell Ed Ott Chris Mortensen Steve Lawrence Naomi Barber King Paul Alexander Thomas P.

The first time I met him was about 30 years ago. I was a graduate student at Northwestern University and assigned to interview somebody, and I had just bought \"In Utero,\" Nirvana's follow-up to its blockbuster album \"Nevermind.\" Albini was the producer of \"In Utero,\" and one of my favorite albums, the Pixies' \"Surfer Rosa,\" and so I called him, he agreed to chat, and while I remember little of what he said, I remember we talked for hours.\n\nHe had studied journalism himself at Northwestern, so he was generous. He had endless opinions on culture and music and what it means to stand by your convictions. I remember at point simply asking what a record producer did. He said he wasn't a record producer, he was a record engineer. I asked what that was, and he said it was like a record producer.\n\nA year ago, the last time I spoke to him, I asked about his first concert, and he replied as he replied to everything, with too much knowledge and detail and an opinion so insightful and provocative and hilarious that it sucked the air from the room. The concert was the Edgar Winter Group, Sept. 27, 1975, Montana, where he lived as a teenager. He recalled his father saying people only went to rock shows to buy drugs. He recalled, as Edgar Winter launched into a 20-minute keyboard solo, the \"dead-eyed gaze\" of Johnny Winter \"navigating solo breaks in this tumultuous excess, like Ahab resigned to his fate in a dinghy, tossed by the sea and pernicious corpus of his brother's prog rock white whale ...\" He didn't know if the concert itself was exactly a good idea, but: \"An impressionable young Steve thanks whoever set it up for those enduring images of madness and futility.\"\n\nAlbini talked like that.\n\nHe was an intimidating guy, and eventually, a sweet guy. He was, as kids say these days, a \"gatekeeper,\" the prototypical record store owner who frowns at what you bring to his cash register -- though he made records, he didn't sell them. The day after he died, the satirical website Hard Times posted this headline: \"Steve Albini standing outside gates of Heaven telling everyone how much he hates the Smashing Pumpkins.\"\n\nHe could go off on corporate culture and its deadening effects on artists and consumers (and did so elegantly at times, for literary journals like the Hyde Park-based Baffler). He produced famous records and made lesser-known ones with his bands Big Black and Shellac, but also became, by dint of his taste, a sought-after totem of cultural integrity -- a representative of a way of being. Or as comedian Fred Armisen told this newspaper several years ago: \"Steve Albini became a huge influence on me, which I don't know if he knows. He had this philosophy on how to live and be and gave me advice I still keep in mind.\" As for Albini, he always kept it blunt: \"I wasn't a fan of Trenchmouth (Armisen's Chicago-based punk band) -- and so that's not why we would have become friends.\"\n\nHe was vintage Gen X sarcastic, ironic, contrarian, defiantly principled. One of the best things ever written on music was Albini's 1993 essay \"The Problem With Music\" for the Baffler, in which he laid out finances, empty promises, unnecessary flourishes. It opens with quite the metaphor: a band (\"some of them good friends, some of them barely acquaintances\") standing at one end of a trench filled with waste and at the other end is a music industry \"lackey\" with a fountain pen and contract. Whoever swims the trench first will get the deal. Only then, the industry insists: \"Swim it again, please. Backstroke.\"\n\nThomas Frank, the founder of the Baffler, told me in an email that he never knew Albini personally, but that essay for the journal would become its \"consummate expression\": \"Seeing through the falsehoods of the culture industry was the first order of business, and no one was better at it than Steve Albini.\"\n\nBy credits alone, Albini became not only a glue stick of underground music, and a major influence around the country as Wicker Park became an early '90s music mecca, but a tastemaker for what was once called college radio music and later rebranded \"alt rock.\"\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person",

Here's a look at the stars we've lost so far in 2024, through April.\n\nSteve Albini, an acclaimed musician who helmed some of the most revered albums across America's alternative music scene, has died after suffering a heart attack at his recording studio. He was 61.\n\nStaff at the studio, Electrical Audio, have confirmed to Pitchfork that Albini died on Tuesday.\n\nThe late musician fronted bands such as Big Black, Rapeman and Shellac, while he also produced albums for the likes of Nirvana, Pixies, PJ Harvey, and Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.\n\nAlbini was heavily influenced by the punk movement during his younger years, and he ultimately founded his own music project called Big Black, firstly as a solo effort before it eventually became a quartet.\n\nThe group released their debut album, \"Atomizer\" in 1986, and they're now recognized as one of the most influential punk groups of the era.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Together, they released five albums and the group are actually scheduled to release their latest record, \"To All Trains,\" next week.\n\nAlbini is probably best know for producing the final studio album by Nirvana, \"In Utero,\" which was released in 1993.\n\nIn 1995, Albini established his own recording studio and he worked with several high-profile acts, including Joanna Newsom, Low, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Manic Street Preachers and Jarvis Cocker.\n\nAway from the music scene, Albini also enjoyed huge success as a poker player, winning two bracelets at World Series of Poker tournaments, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money.\n\nAlbini is survived by his wife, movie-maker Heather Whinna.\n\nPhotos: Notable deaths in 2024 Glynis Johns Adan Canto Bud Harrelson Dejan Milojevic Jack Burke Mary Weiss Norman Jewison Charles Osgood Melanie Safka Chita Rivera Carl Weathers Wayne Kramer Ian Lavender Toby Keith Henry Fambrough Bob Edwards Don Gullett Lefty Driesell Andreas Brehme Golden Richards Richard Lewis Nikolai Ryzhkov Brian Mulroney Akira Toriyama Iris Apfel Andy Russell Ed Ott Chris Mortensen Steve Lawrence Naomi Barber King Paul Alexander Thomas P.

Aged 17, he was involved in a serious road accident: hit by a car while riding his motorcycle, he badly broke his leg. It was while recuperating that he learnt his first instrument, the bass guitar, but that wasn't really the crux of the tale. It was that, while he was in hospital, he received a succession of phone calls from his classmates. They weren't calling to inquire after his welfare, or to wish him to get well soon: they hated him so much they'd rung up to tell him they were glad he was in pain.\n\nIt was a very Steve Albini kind of anecdote. For most of his musical career - and apparently for years before it - he cut a wilfully confrontational, provocative and polarising figure: as Michael Azerrad noted in his peerless history of American post-punk alternative rock, Our Band Could Be Your Life, a lot of what Albini did \"implicitly screamed 'hate me, please!'\" There were the spectacularly abusive columns he wrote for fanzines in his adopted hometown of Chicago, the subject matter of the songs by his band Big Black, and even the way their records were packaged (Albini stuffed razor blades and fish-hooks into the sleeve of their debut EP Lungs; 1987's Headache featured a cover photograph of a shotgun suicide victim whose head had split in half).\n\nThere was the appalling name of his next band, Rapeman, and his willingness to bad-mouth artists who'd availed themselves of his services as a record producer, usually for failing to live up to his own rigorous standards when it came to shunning commercialism and the mainstream music industry : he publicly dismissed the album that effectively made his name as a producer, the Pixies' 1988 masterpiece Surfer Rosa, as \"a patchwork pinch-loaf from a band who at their top dollar best are blandly entertaining college rock\"; Nirvana, who called upon his services for 1993's In Utero were \"unremarkable\". Azzerad interpreted the whole \"hate me please!\" thing as \"the pre-emptive instincts of someone who's been routinely picked on\". Whatever it was, it worked: when Paul Smith of the British label Blast First went to Chicago to sign Big Black, he was astonished by the experience of walking with Albini through the city: every block, he reported back, someone would yell abuse at Albini, usually calling him an \"asshole\".\n\nAs Alibini freely admitted in his later years, some of his provocations - which involved homophobia, racism and misogyny - looked utterly indefensible in retrospect: \"a lot of things I said and did from an ignorant position of comfort and privilege are clearly awful and I regret them,\" he wrote in 2023. That said, the actual music he made was frequently astonishing. Big Black took a while to get going - their early EPs featured a band slowly inching their way towards finding their sound - but when they hit their stride, on their 1986 album Atomizer, the effect was jaw-dropping. The song lyrics variously dealt with child abuse, arson - perhaps Big Black's best-known track, the six-minute Kerosene - domestic violence, corrupt policemen and cattle slaughterhouses, the music offered a relentless, pummelling drum machine and low-slung bass and two guitars distorted to the point that they sounded like saws tearing through metal (or, as the credits onomatopoeically put it, went \"grrr\" and \"skinng\"), the latter effect amplified by Albini's preference for playing guitar with a metal plectrum. The effect could alternately be terrifying or cathartic: either way Big Black sounded like no one else.\n\nIf anything, 1987's Songs About Fucking was even better, but Big Black had already split up, prompted by the guitarist Santiago Durango's decision to go to law school: \"breaking up is an idea that has occurred to far too few groups\", read the album's sleevenotes. Albini's next band, the aforementioned Rapeman, proved a provocation too far - their gigs were pickets and disrupted by protestors; Albini later called their name, taken from a Japanese cartoon character, \"unconscionable\", the bass player David Sims described it as \"the biggest musical regret of my life\"; their solitary album Two Nuns And a Pack Mule had its moments of raw, lurching power, but was nowhere near as consistently thrilling as Big Black. They split after barely two years.\n\nBut Shellac lasted for the remainder of Albini's life, receiving unwavering critical acclaim, probably because the standard of their irregular album releases - and their equally sporadic live performances - seldom slipped. Another trio, their debut At Action Park suggested a band more subtle, angular, even mature than either of their predecessors, although such things were relative: it was hugely powerful but you would struggle to describe it as anything other than abrasive, while the subject matter of Albini's lyrics remained as hair-raising as ever. By the time of its release, he was more widely known as a producer, whose \"high quality but minimal\" style flew against increasingly prevalent trends - he recorded using analogue equipment (\"fuck digital\", he characteristically offered), disdained the increasing use of equalizers and compression, kept vocals low in the mix - which he felt amounted to \"pandering to commercial interests\", concentrating instead on the sound of guitars and punch of the rhythm section - and was big on capturing the \"sound\" of a room by placing vintage microphones around it. Whatever Albini thought about their music, his work on Surfer Rosa made the Pixies sound awesomely powerful: it feels like the band are playing live, inches away from your face. On PJ Harvey's Rid Of Me, his production is the perfect match for Harvey's shift towards a darker, more visceral tone: it amplifies both the glowering tension in the music and moments of cathartic release.\n\nNot everyone was impressed by his approach: Nirvana hired REM's producer Scott Litt to remix several tracks from In Utero, much to Albini's disgust; Fugazi re-recorded an entire Albini-produced album In on the Kill Taker; Elvis Costello once opined that Albini made PJ Harvey sound \"like shit\", adding \"that guy doesn't know anything about production\". On the other hand, post-Nirvana, he became a kind of go-to guy for big artists wishing to demonstrate a certain edginess and conversance with underground cool or wanting to cock a snook at their major label paymasters: he worked with Jimmy Page and Robert Plant - one suspects at the latter's behest - on 1998's Walking into Clarksdale, and with the grunge-lite band Bush.\n\nIf he was being viewed in some quarters as a kind of credibility trophy, he seemed blithely unbothered. He charged a flat fee - more for a major label artist, cheap rates for smaller bands - preferred not to be credited, refused to take royalty points, would apparently work with any artist who contacted him and declined to argue with their decisions: in Luke Haines's autobiography Bad Vibes, the former Auteurs frontman recalled Albini acceding to any suggestion the band made with the phrase \"sure - I'm your whore\". Along the way, he worked with a succession of acclaimed alt-rock luminaries - Low, Mogwai, Plush, Will Oldham, Nina Nastasia, the Manic Street Preachers, Joanna Newsom - as well as a couple of his formative influences: the reformed Stooges and Cheap Trick, whose He's a Whore Big Black had covered.\n\nMeanwhile, Shellac kept up a very intermittent stream of albums - 2000's 1000 Hurts, complete with its notorious opening track, Prayer to God, and 2007's Excellent Italian Greyhound, home to The End Of Radio, a startling eight-minute example of the trio's grasp of dynamics, are both highly recommended - and Albini was regularly sought for his staunch views on independence from the music industry: no matter how much the music industry changed, he never seemed to waver, just as his own music remained uncompromising. The only thing that seemed to change about him was his view of what the Guardian called \"his former bad self\", his willingness to cause offence. \"I can't defend any of it,\" he said. \"It was all coming from a privileged position of someone who would never have to suffer any of the hatred that's embodied in that language.\"\n\nBut there was even something unflinching and uncompromising about his apologies. He made no excuses for himself - \"the one thing I don't want to say is 'the culture shifted - excuse my behaviour' ... I was wrong at the time.\" In its own way, it was a very Steve Albini-ish repudiation, not least in the way he baulked at the idea he was doing it to in any way curry favour. \"It's not,\" he said

He worked on more than 2,000 albums in his lifetime. Many of those were among the most important bands of his generation, from America's punk underground -- with bands such as Slint, Silkworm, Jawbreaker, Pegboy, Tar and the Jesus Lizard -- to mainstream stars like Nirvana, PJ Harvey, Cheap Trick, Bush and the Pixies.\n\nIn 1997 he opened Electrical Audio, a two-story recording studio in Avondale that became his homebase. He also was a prolific musician who played in a series of bands -- Rapeman, Big Black and Shellac.\n\n\"Since the late '80s until yesterday, Steve was one of, if not the sole torchbearer of integrity in independent music in Chicago and the world. There is no 'Chicago sound' without Steve,\" said Ed Roche, former label manager with Touch and Go Records, the Chicago label that issued the majority of Albini's personal recording projects.\n\nAlbini \"inspired hundreds, if not thousands, of kids to pick up an instrument, try to sing, engineer and enter business ethically,\" Roche said.\n\nRick Rizzo of Eleventh Dream Day posted on Instagram that Albini's \"influence on anybody that made music around here was profound. Anything [else] I could say would be an understatement.\" Musician Jason Narducy called Albini's influence \"astounding and carried across platforms.\"\n\nMetro owner Joe Shanahan, who had a tense relationship with Albini, said both men ultimately made peace in 2019. He called Wednesday \"a dark day for Chicago and for the world.\"\n\n\"Steve, as thorny as he could be, he was a fan of the music. Provocateur, troublemaker, firestarter, yes, but he was a big, big fan and thank God, he was a big fan of Chicago music because he helped put Chicago on the map,\" Shanahan said. \"He said a lot of things in the press that were very provocative, but he made people listen.\"\n\nMusicians who worked with Albini often hailed him for his precise understanding of sound, a passion for analog recording techniques and a healthy respect for genres that went beyond his own interests. Country singer and songwriter Robbie Fulks sought Albini out early in his career and the pair worked on six albums together.\n\n\"Antiquated technologies, marginal music, cruel wit, personal friendship and contrarianism make life worth living, and he embodied all of these otherwise unrelated things in his passions and personality,\" Fulks said.\n\n\"He'd miss sleep, meals and leisure to make your record sound a little better. You'd be the recipient of extravagant gestures if you were his friend. If you were a president of a record company, he'd refuse your call or hang up on you,\" Fulks said.\n\nIn the studio, Albini \"embraced the sickly causes of analog tape and nonautomated mixing back in the 1980s and never let go,\" Fulks added. \"His advocacy was both principled and extreme, and it took a lot of grit, as well as some money, which he earned from his Nirvana record and many poker competitions, to keep the cause afloat.\"\n\nIn his later years, Albini spent time on the professional poker circuit, was an avid Chicago Cubs fan and he was behind many charitable causes. Letters to Santa, an annual Christmas show at Second City he produced over two decades with his wife, Heather Whinna, raised money every year for Chicago's neediest families through a 24-hour rotation of performances from both music stars and comedy improvisers.\n\nHe once described the moment he read a letter Whinna brought home from the post office.\n\n\"These weren't impish requests for toys or a new bike; mostly, they were desperate pleas from heads of households asking for help. It was staggering,\" he wrote. \"I couldn't help but be moved when I read it, and the realization that there were hundreds -- no, thousands -- of these letters changed something in me.\"", "source":

To a large extent, that's what music is: a fuel of sorts; you can't name it, store it or burn it, but you can feel it. That adrenalising fuel pours off of every piece of music that Albini ever made or produced. You could be subjected to a Russian sleep experiment, wearily stumble into a Shellac, and within moments, you'd be as alive and awake as a squirrel who snook into a Snickers factory.\n\nThe incorporeal energy of music is always apparent when you're younger. Before you fall into adulthood and overthinking, the fizz and pop of rock 'n' roll is like a dance-inducing static. It seems this sentiment is one that never left Albini, he clung to it punk barnacle, channeling into masterpieces like Surfer Rosa, In Utero, Rid of Me, and just about everything else he touched.\n\nMaking music, to him, was largely about limiting and shunning anything that precluded the production of rarified musical fuel at its most potent. That's the Albini sound - not a wall of strings, innovative synths or fucking cleverly composed middle eights, just raucous electricity that no scholar has ever defined but every gig goer, flagging marathon runner who staggers upon the right song on shuffle, and everyone else who has found themselves wrapped up in the euphoria of music, has felt.\n\nTo achieve this, Albini knew that the process could not be overcomplicated. That doesn't mean that nuance and depth went out of the pitch, but both had to be sincere enough to conjure in a matter of moments. Thus, speed was an important part of his process. In fact, you can pretty much narrow down his outlook to a sacred triumvirate.\n\nWhen he mused over the worst song ever written, Albini didn't just go for a grating melody or irritating chorus, as ever he took the soul of sacrosanct music onto his shoulders and laid into a tragic misstep in its modern constitution. \"As a recording engineer -- someone who is deeply embroiled in the process of making records every day -- you see trends and fads run through the social organization of the population of musicians in the same way that they would run through a high school,\" he told AV Club.\n\nSo, he was always wary of everyone channelling African influences in the wake of Brian Eno. But even more grating than when it is done for a mark of difference is when these progressive angles take hold, and a bandwagon is jumped on with commerciality in mind. In his view, the worst offender in history was the first song to ever use autotune. \"'Believe' is this horrible dance-pop song that Cher did in one of her many vampire-rising-from-its-own-ashes moments that she's had so frequently in her career,\" he viciously claims. \"It had one of these synthetic moments that I could tell instantly, that was going to be the go-to gimmick for everyone who was stuck for an idea.\"\n\nHe concluded: \"All those people who had been sneaking the odd note into Auto-Tune to try to hide the fact that they were bad singers, now they could embrace the fact that they were bad singers. That seemed inevitable, but when it finally happened, it seemed really depressing to me.\"\n\nWith this in mind, tech in his own work was defined as merely a means to an end. Artists should embrace bad notes and imperfections; it's what makes something perfectly noteworthy.\n\nIt's a quote that defined his outlook: \"If a record takes more than a week to make, somebody's fucking up\". He said that in his pitch to Nirvana, who were, at that time, the biggest band in the world, fresh off the bombastic success of Nevermind, when other potential producers were likely telling them that they would devote every minute of an entire year to fine-tuning their follow-up.\n\nInstead, Albini wanted to get straight to the heart of it. Sure, Les Mis\u00e9rables might've taken 12 years to write, but at their peak, the Donald brothers were cracking out a copy of Viz every month and trading the desk for the pub by 3pm, and I know which one I think is better. As he said himself, \"All an album should be is a representation of a band doing its thing presented in a permanent format. It shouldn't take a month to do that.\"\n\nHe had three tips to achieve this: brevity, track live, and speak your mind. He might not have produced them, but proof that this works can be found in the fact that Bob Dylan created three of the finest albums in existence - Bringing It All Back Home (1965), Highway 61 Revisited (1965), and Blonde on Blonde (1966) - in a little over 15 months. That's not a bad trick to beat new bands into a state of sincerity with. Albini used it with aplomb.\n\nMuch of this has painted Albini as some sort of slapdash heathen who simply hit record and either played or demanded punk at its most simple. Alas, this is also untrue. It's actually just that he hid the intricacies and fiddly bits from view, creating a more conducive environment for fuel production and consumption, in turn.\n\nWhen Far Out spoke to David Gedge of The Wedding Present, he explained how Albini paved the way towards perfection, like the planner of Central Park: you barely realised that the magic occurring behind the mixing desk was manmade. \"We just really got on. He's got this reputation of being difficult to work with, but he was absolutely perfect for us,\" Gedge explains. \"It's all boring stuff really, but he just knows about EQs and where to put microphones so that a drumkit sounds right, all the boring stuff that I have no interest in, really.\"\n\nWith such knowledge and expertise stowed away, this allowed Albini to simply treat what followed his groundwork as play. It was almost like he was trying to get back to the prelapsarian point of childhood where music is merely energy, paradoxically by learning everything there is to know about. It's hard not to listen to Surfer Rosa and think that he very possibly achieved that Promethean feat.", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_taylor@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Tom Taylor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-two-bar_form", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thirty-two-bar form"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shellac (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-Tune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auto-Tune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snickers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snickers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "String instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punk rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Synthesizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Believe_(Cher_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Believe (Cher song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance-pop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dance-pop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Eno"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soul music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressive rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blonde_on_Blonde_(rock_group)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blonde on Blonde (rock group)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gedge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Gedge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wedding_Present", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wedding Present"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/static/uploads/1/2024/04/Steve-Albini-Live-Far-Out-Magazine.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Whether you saw the musician and recording engineer, who has died aged 61, as a bastion of ethics in a broken industry, a tape-obsessed iconoclast, an underground historian, or a proto-edgelord with the unusual ability to evolve, there is no disputing that he stuck to these beliefs.\n\nThere aren't many people in the game who do that, and fewer still who leave behind a legacy that can be said to have shaped the narrative of modern alternative music, from Big Black to PJ Harvey, Nirvana to Joanna Newsom. Here are 10 of Albini's best records as both a bandleader and analogue-zealot studio genius.\n\nBig Black's music said a lot about Albini as a young person - it was abrasive, sardonic, unpleasant and uncompromising. The noise-rock pioneers' first LP might live in the shadow of 1987's Songs About Fucking but it offers the purest distillation of their sound: Albini and Santiago Durango's cheesewire guitars, the inhuman thrum of a drum machine and unhinged vocals that channel Albini's fascination with violence, inertia and small town depravity, with the discomfiting feeling that he's studying it as a scientist would a petri dish.\n\nThe songs on Pixies' first LP balanced classically taut pop hooks with true outsider energy and, thanks to a recommendation from Ivo Watts-Russell, their boss at 4AD, they lucked into an engineer whose approach was similarly contradictory. At the 16-track Q Division in the band's native Boston, Albini used the limitations of the studio to their advantage, placing amps in hallways to capture better acoustics and stringing up mics to harness the feel of the live space on David Lovering's drum tracks, which would become a blueprint for generations of rock bands.\n\nBy 1991 Superchunk had honed their rollicking fusion of power-pop and punk energy through DIY touring. Working from 6pm to 6am for three nights at the glitzy Chicago Recording Company, where Albini had an after-hours hookup, their second LP's barrage of hooks, rattling bass and chiming guitars cohered into something like college-rock's ideal form. \"Steve kept saying my leads were like the guy from REO Speedwagon, which was intended as an insult,\" frontman Mac McCaughan said in the book Our Noise. \"But I secretly took a small amount of pride in that.\"\n\nAround 30 seconds into Rid of Me's title track, an undulation in Polly Jean Harvey's half-muted guitar creates the sense that everything is getting louder. It feels like the musician is digging in, though, rather than a fader being moved - a telling glimpse into the documentary approach musicians wanted from Albini. Assembled in a couple of weeks at the secluded Pachyderm studios in Minnesota, his inventive mic placements and track-it-and-move-on approach meshed perfectly with songs that were desperate and fearless, lurching from shlock-and-roll to portentous blues using a basic guitar-bass-drums formation with zero sugar-coating.\n\nIf there was one person who didn't care that Nirvana were the biggest band on Earth it was Steve Albini, who dismissed Nevermind's multi-tracked gloss as an exercise in \"hack\" recording. He once recalled taking the In Utero job out of sympathy for \"punk rock fan\" musicians he believed were being crushed under a label's boot, which is very him. Undercutting the hype, the record was made in his usual rapid fashion in a matter of days at Pachyderm, with Kurt Cobain's gnarly, harrowing songs displayed as they were. The story has become the aftermath - Geffen's horrified reaction and the decision to remix its singles - but In Utero's staging is perfect, from the booming weight of Dave Grohl's drums to Cobain's lacerating screams.\n\nAlbini rarely shied away from bands who wanted to get into sludgy recesses, but rarely did he meet his match as he did on Times of Grace, where California post-metallers Neurosis found fresh depths to their sound. It is possible to see the grime under the fingernails of these songs, with guitarist-vocalists Scott Kelly and Steve Von Till trading in molasses-thick riffage and gut-wrenching yells. The monstrous Under the Surface, all drawn-out rage and surprising shards of melody, features an unrelenting barrage of percussion as good as anything in Albini's engineering catalogue.\n\nIn 1992, Albini began experimenting with the \"minimalist rock trio\" Shellac, finding new ways to excite and disgust listeners with only guitar, bass, drums and his increasingly confident, still sneering voice. 1000 Hurts is perhaps the best evocation of the noise-rock chemistry he found with Bob Weston and Todd Trainer, a peerless rhythm section whose grinding low end and punishing snare snaps combine for a sense of resonance that recalls getting slapped with an open hand. To All Trains, the sixth Shellac LP, is out next week.\n\nAlbini's ability to put you in the room with a band was usually deployed in service of something confrontational or intimate, but it was also a perfect match for the shaggy aura of Jason Molina. Recorded live, there is an element here of stepping back and letting a bar band cook, but also a desire to present the scope of some classic American rock songs. During Hold On Magnolia we're feet from a low stage as Molina pours his heart out, while on I've Been Riding With a Ghost, Jennie Benford's vocals are caught by the wind and hauled skywards, with a remarkable sense of the great wide open conjured from within the four walls of Electrical Audio, the Chicago studio Albini founded in the mid-1990s.\n\nHere, Albini's work was part of a much wider whole. He recorded Newsom's harp and vocals before the record's orchestral arrangements were overseen by Van Dyke Parks, meaning that even though these avant-pop pieces were something of a stylistic leap into the unknown, his role was familiar. He was there to facilitate and capture an honest performance, recorded by candlelight over the course of a couple of days. \"I think it would have been very different if I'd recorded with the orchestra,\" Newsom later told the Wire. \"I think there would have been much more formality, more stiffness, and much less emotional presence.\"\n\n\"He approached Sunn O))) in a way that a cinematographer would,\" Greg Anderson told Music Tech of working with Albini. On Life Metal that meant pointing his camera at twin guitar drone-metal desolation, with Anderson and his bandmate Stephen O'Malley drawing out hulking, filthy riffs and feedback collages for as long as 20 minutes a time. There is true patience at work here - the band sought to achieve total oblivion through sheer volume and bloody-mindedness, and Albini let them. In doing so, he helped crystallise their vision into something that, once you let it slowly crush you, achieves zoned-out bliss.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

One of his calling cards as a producer was Nirvana's In Utero album, in which he famously penned a four-page letter after the massive success of Nirvana's Nevermind album where he pitched himself to produce the band's next record, but \"only if we do it right.\"\n\nAlbini agreed with some of the comments that Kurt Cobain had made about wanting to record the album quickly and with little interference. \"I think the very best thing you could do at this point is exactly what you are talking about doing: bang a record out in a couple of days, with high quality but minimal 'production' and no interference from the front office bulletheads. If that is indeed what you want to do, I would love to be involved,\" said the producer.\n\nHe would later add in the proposal the blunt statement, \"If a record takes more than a week to make, somebody's fucking up.\"\n\nThe letter can be read in full in the social media post below:\n\nBack in 2023, during the celebration of the 30th anniversary of Nirvana's In Utero album, Steve Albini joined Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic on the Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend podcast (viewed below).\n\nHe recalled of his initial introduction to the group, \"I wasn't super familiar with Nirvana. I had heard the ubiquitous stuff that was played on the radio and all the clubs and like every gig you would go to before loading in the sound guy would put Nevermind on to crank and balance the P.A. So I had heard the album many times sort of second hand.\"\n\nThe producer also made note in his letter that he was not interested in taking \"points\" on the album, which would have yielded a bigger payday for him but hurt the band.\n\nHe explained to O'Brien, \"The way the record producers were compensated at that time in particular was a trick of accounting that shifted the costs away from the label and toward the band, made the band ultimately responsible for what the producer got paid. It didn't come out of the general proceeds of the record,\" explained Albini.\n\nREAD MORE: Steve Albini Reveals Song Mishap That Made It to Nirvana's 'In Utero' Album\n\n\"Literally every dollar I would get paid would be a dollar that Dave didn't get or Krist didn't get or Kurt didn't get,\" he continued. \"I think that's ethically untenable, and I'll admit that I think less of people who opt to do things that way.

I work on a record for a few days and then for the rest of your fucking life, you have to keep paying me?!\"\n\nIn addition to being a producer, Albini himself was a musician who earned some fame playing in the bands Big Black and Shellac.\n\nBut he was primarily known for his production work, having produced Pixies' critically hailed and influential Surfer Rosa album, as well as Nirvana's In Utero. He also produced or worked as an audio engineer on albums from The Breeders, The Jesus Lizard, Urge Overkill, Failure, PJ Harvey, Jawbreaker, Superchunk, Bush, Jimmy Page & Robert Plant, Chevelle, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, High on Fire, Cheap Trick, Scott Weiland, Neurosis, Foxy Shazam, Laura Jane Grace and Code Orange among others.", "source": {"uri": "loudwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Loudwire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chad_childers@loudwire.com", "name": "Chad Childers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_O'Brien", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conan O'Brien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Cobain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Cobain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krist_Novoselic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Krist Novoselic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Grohl", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dave Grohl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pixies (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Orange_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Code Orange (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urge_Overkill", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urge Overkill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shellac (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_Lizard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Jesus Lizard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevelle_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevelle (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_and_Plant", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Page and Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_on_Fire", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High on Fire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superchunk", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superchunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Black", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Weiland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott Weiland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neurosis (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Spencer_Blues_Explosion", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Spencer Blues Explosion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawbreaker_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jawbreaker (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxy_Shazam", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foxy Shazam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breeders", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Breeders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheap_Trick", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cheap Trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Jane_Grace", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laura Jane Grace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ_Harvey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PJ Harvey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums_and_Frames", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums and Frames", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/366/files/2024/05/attachment-Nirvana-Steve-Albini.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Here's a look at the stars we've lost so far in 2024, through April.\n\nSteve Albini, an acclaimed musician who helmed some of the most revered albums across America's alternative music scene, has died after suffering a heart attack at his recording studio. He was 61.\n\nStaff at the studio, Electrical Audio, have confirmed to Pitchfork that Albini died on Tuesday.\n\nThe late musician fronted bands such as Big Black, Rapeman and Shellac, while he also produced albums for the likes of Nirvana, Pixies, PJ Harvey, and Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.\n\nAlbini was heavily influenced by the punk movement during his younger years, and he ultimately founded his own music project called Big Black, firstly as a solo effort before it eventually became a quartet.\n\nThe group released their debut album, \"Atomizer\" in 1986, and they're now recognized as one of the most influential punk groups of the era.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nUnidentified company considering Davenport for $800 million data center Family Resources in Davenport to lay off 26 Two dead after shooting in Moline Sunday, police ask public for photo, video evidence Woman gives CPR after shooting in East Moline, police chief confirms one dead Officials identify two people shot and killed Sunday in Moline Alabama man arrested in relation to killing in East Moline, victim identified 288 new apartments going up in Bettendorf near TBK Bank Sports Complex A violent Sunday leaves one dead in East Moline, two killed in Moline Muscatine furry discusses lifestyle, social media posts Davenport woman with ties to slain man faces drug charges Davenport man faces three felony charges for allegedly defrauding multiple area banks Davenport collapse lawsuits: City files appeal to Iowa Supreme Court Davenport man was under surveillance, subject of investigation before he was killed Davenport Learning Center to re-launch programming for alternative education, IEP students Search warrant: Davenport duo accused of double murder were ready to 'shoot it out with the police'\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nDespite this, the group split and in 1987, Albini formed a new band called Rapeman.\n\nAlbini then formed Shellac in 1992 alongside drummer Todd Trainer and bassist Bob Weston. Together, they released five albums and the group are actually scheduled to release their latest record, \"To All Trains,\" next week.\n\nAlbini is probably best know for producing the final studio album by Nirvana, \"In Utero,\" which was released in 1993.\n\nIn 1995, Albini established his own recording studio and he worked with several high-profile acts, including Joanna Newsom, Low, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Manic Street Preachers and Jarvis Cocker.\n\nAway from the music scene, Albini also enjoyed huge success as a poker player, winning two bracelets at World Series of Poker tournaments, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money.\n\nAlbini is survived by his wife, movie-maker Heather Whinna.\n\nPhotos: Notable deaths in 2024\n\nGlynis Johns\n\nAdan Canto\n\nCORRECTION Obit Harrelson Baseball\n\nDejan Milojevic\n\nJack Burke\n\nMary Weiss\n\nNorman Jewison\n\nCharles Osgood\n\nMelanie Safka\n\nChita Rivera\n\nCarl Weathers\n\nWayne Kramer\n\nIan Lavender\n\nToby Keith\n\nHenry Fambrough\n\nBob Edwards\n\nDon Gullett\n\nLefty Driesell\n\nAndreas Brehme\n\nGolden Richards\n\nRichard Lewis\n\nNikolai Ryzhkov\n\nBrian Mulroney\n\nAkira Toriyama\n\nIris Apfel\n\nAndy Russell\n\nEd Ott\n\nChris Mortensen\n\nSteve Lawrence\n\nNaomi Barber King\n\nPaul Alexander\n\nThomas P.

A session he had helmed for the late Mark Linkous more than a dozen years earlier at Electrical Audio, his efficient and economic Chicago studio, had been salvaged by the singer's family and was about to be released. Within an hour of my Tuesday morning email, he'd volunteered access to his memories: \"I'm in session all week,\" he wrote. \"I typically start work at 10.30 these days so any time before that I can talk.\"\n\nI was not surprised to find Albini at work. The famed recording engineer, who died from a heart attack earlier this week at the age of 61, was a pillar of independent music's sound and ethos. In the four decades since he'd fled Montana bullies to study journalism at Northwestern University, he had engineered or otherwise worked on close to 1,500 albums, from commercial landmarks like the Pixies' Surfer Rosa and Nirvana's In Utero to cult staples like Dirty Three's Ocean Songs and Tony Conrad's Slapping Pythagoras and almost every point in between.\n\nNeurosis and Joanna Newsom, Low and Helmet, PJ Harvey and Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy: Few others have had Albini's dynamic or stylistic range and, consequently, his infiltrating impact on the very idea of independent music. He captured the quiet and the loud all at once, the famous and the fringe with the same studied intensity and depth. What's more, Albini's own bands, most notably Big Black and Shellac, had resharpened rock music's dulled edge with his demented character studies and savage metal-on-metal guitar tone. He was, by all facts and fables, devoted to his work.\n\nStill, I was struck by his schedule. Only weeks before our exchange, Albini had turned 61, long past the point in the record industry where many of his lucky peers are living off the royalty checks of records made long ago -- their proverbial \"mailbox money.\" But not Albini: He'd produced (a word he truly despised, always favoring the workmanlike \"recorded\" or \"engineered\") enough records to require multiple mailboxes, but he had rejected taking \"points\" on deals, the gravy train of the record industry. \"I would like to be paid like a plumber,\" he wrote in his confidently utilitarian letter to Nirvana as they courted him for In Utero. And so, day to day, he often remained at Electrical Audio, the place, he once bragged to Michael Azerrad, that \"was built entirely by punk rockers.\" When he died Tuesday, he still charged just $900 a day, less than a quarter of what someone with his bona fides could command.

It goes, vaguely, like this: There is nothing better than the sound of a drum kit in an empty room.\n\nAs a producer, Albini, who recorded albums by Nirvana, PJ Harvey, Pixies, the Breeders, and hundreds of others, was renowned as an icon of punk-rock purity, one who approached the process of making albums and the business of selling them with the same uncompromising approach. When Nirvana was overwhelmed by the runaway success of their major-label debut, Nevermind, they turned to Albini for the follow-up, In Utero, hoping that his abrasive approach would help reduce their fan base to a more manageable level. Instead of jumping at the chance to work with the hottest band in the world, Albini responded with a lengthy letter outlining the circumstances under which he would, and would not, make an album with them. If they wanted to \"bang a record out in a couple of days,\" he was all-in. If, on the other hand, there was a risk that the record company might interfere with the process, \"then you're in for a bummer and I want no part of it.\"\n\nThat same year, Albini, whose association with the alternative-rock boom had made him a household, or at least a dorm-room, name, wrote \"The Problem With Music,\" an acidic attack on the corporatization of music that, even three decades hence, still has enough heat to crisp your eyebrows. It begins like this:\n\nAnd it ends like this, with bold in the original: \"Some of your friends are probably already this fucked.\"\n\nWhat impressed me at the time was Albini's righteous hostility, his refusal to make excuses for an industry he saw as irredeemably corrupt. He wouldn't even take a traditional producing credit on the albums he made, insisting on \"recorded by\" instead, preferring a material description of his labor to the vague idea that he had somehow \"produced\" something. The music, he reasoned, belonged to the musicians, as did the money it made, which is why he declined to take \"points\" -- a percentage of the profits -- on the songs he engineered. In his letter to Nirvana, he said he wanted to \"be paid like a plumber\" for the work he did and nothing more. Anything else, he wrote, was \"ethically indefensible.\"\n\nBut Albini's no was also a yes, one that looked beyond the sonic trends of the moment and the record-industry feeding frenzies that coaxed starry-eyed musicians into contracts that boosted their short-term exposure at the expense of their long-term existence. Reading it now, I'm struck by the extent to which \"The Problem With Music\" is not just a jeremiad -- although it is, in every bilious utterance -- but a warning. Albini doesn't just rage against the machine. He names names: of musicians turned major-label scouts whom he paints as glorified procurers, of underground icons, like Talking Heads' Jerry Harrison and Sonic Youth's Lee Ranaldo, who take vanity producing credits on other people's albums. And he names numbers, breaking down, one line item at a time, how a seemingly generous recording contract can end up making everyone rich but the artists themselves. By the time he's done with his example, a band signed for a quarter of a million dollars ends up making just over $4,000 apiece. \"The band members have each earned about 1/3 as much as they would working at a 7-11,\" he concludes, \"but they got to ride in a tour bus for a month.\"\n\nAlbini sometimes courted confrontation -- in the late 1980s, he led a short-lived noise band called Rapeman -- but he softened in his later decades, choosing his targets more intentionally. Without intending to, he became the model of a gracefully aging Gen Xer holding fast to his principles but seeming less intent on repelling anyone who didn't precisely share, or even dared to question, them. He was also an unexpected and improbable delight on Twitter, railing against connoisseurs' latter-day embrace of Steely Dan, whose music he said was \"made for the sole purpose of letting the wedding band stretch out a little.\" But he also used his account to ruminate on his past personae, especially the bluntly provocative \"'edgelord' shit\" of his earlier bands. \"I was a cruder person back then,\" he said in a subsequent interview, in which he called that old band name \"inexcusable.\" \"It's worth it to interrogate yourself and try to figure out why you're doing things the way you are.\"\n\nAlthough the music he made himself was as unsparing as his reputation -- To All Trains, the first album in 10 years by his trio Shellac, is due out next week -- Albini's minimalism was never the whole story. Listen, for example, to Joanna Newsom's Ys, whose lush orchestrations feel even livelier because of the way his recording gives each instrument room to breathe. But I keep coming back to those drums. On PJ Harvey's Rid of Me, you can hear the way the sound of the snares travels through space, not just keeping the beat but describing a universe you're invited to inhabit. Most contemporary recordings are so compressed and optimized they might as well have been recorded in orbit around a distant planet, but with Albini's, you're right in the room, experiencing the music in the instant it comes into existence. In that moment, there's nothing better.", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_adams@slate.com", "name": "Sam Adams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pixies (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breeders", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Breeders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minimalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ_Harvey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PJ Harvey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drum kit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punk rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alternative rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading,_Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reading, Berkshire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapeman", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shellac (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joanna Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Ranaldo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Ranaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steely_Dan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steely Dan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snare_drum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snare drum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orchestration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noise music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talking Heads"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Train"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recording contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Youth", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sonic Youth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/016d7842-5529-4bd8-898d-7e6588d9ab03.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Then you see pictures of him and he just looks like this skinny little guy. He's just smarter and funnier and better at everything than everyone else in the world,\" Grohl said.\n\n\"And he had made so many records that we loved, he'd made Pixies records and Breeders records and Jesus' [Lizards] records. So when we went to record with him I know I was nervous because I knew what kind of dude and I just thought he would hate me because I'm such an idiot. I think he treated me like a pet so we got along great because I was the drummer.\n\n\"But yeah he's one of a kind and I'm glad that I had the opportunity to tell his story because I think he set's a great example for not only musicians but also for the industry and how to think outside just conventional business. He lives to do things that are real and passionate and his level of integrity is unwavering, he just won't bend and he's stubborn for all the right reasons so I love him to death, I think he's amazing.\"\n\nRecalling working with the producer, former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic also previously told NME how Kurt Cobain was a big admirer of the late producer.\n\n\"Kurt was a fan of Albini. I remember being in a tour van in 1989 and Kurt was listening to Pixies. He raised his finger and said, 'This shall be our snare sound!' He wanted to do it with Steve for a long time,\" he said.\n\nAlbini also previously spoke of how he was more of an \"engineer\" than a producer to Nirvana, and recalled how Cobain came to him as a vocal admirer of his work with previous band, Big Black.\n\n\"When my band Big Black did a farewell tour years before the 'In Utero' sessions, the final show was in some industrial space in Seattle,\" he said. \"It was in a weird building with a makeshift stage. It was a cool gig and at end we smashed up all of our gear. I distinctively recall some kid asking me if he could take a piece of my guitar off the stage and me saying 'go ahead its garbage now'.\n\n\"Many years later when we were working on 'In Utero' at the studio in Minnesota, Kurt showed me this little piece of this guitar that he had saved. He had brought it with him after all those years. He had been that kid.\"\n\nMeanwhile, earlier today (May 9) Nirvana's social media accounts shared the four-page letter Albini sent to them, proposing that he produce 'In Utero'.\n\nFollowing the news of Albini's death, Pixies, Benefits and more have paid tribute to the late producer - you can read them here. Jarvis Cocker also recalled the impact that working with the producer during 'Further Complications' had on him, and The Cribs shared their fond memories of the icon. PJ Harvey also said he \"changed the course of my life\" during sessions for her 1993 LP 'Rid Of Me'.", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "damian_jones@nme.com", "name": "Damian Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Grohl", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dave Grohl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Cobain", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Cobain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pixies (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_6_Music", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 6 Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recording studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronic music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Black", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NME", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NME"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krist_Novoselic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Krist Novoselic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drummer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bass guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concert tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cribs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Cribs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snare_drum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snare drum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarvis_Cocker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarvis Cocker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ_Harvey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PJ Harvey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LP_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LP record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home_Recording", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home Recording", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_davegrohl_stevealbini_getty_2000x1270.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 2759, "textEnd": 2764}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

critic of the major-label music industry from the beginning, Albini made his name with serrated, noisy rock as part of independent bands like Big Black and Shellac.\n\nBut it was his time at the mixing desk, giving shape to some of the most influential albums of the 1990s American alt-rock boom, that secured his place in wider notoriety.\n\nKnown for rejecting expansive studio setups in favour of uncomplicated and raw recordings, Albini lent his edge to Pixies' 'Surfer Rosa', PJ Harvey's 'Rid of Me', and Nirvana's 'In Utero', the latter of which was remixed for market by label DCG after he completed work, with the original mixes audible on latter-day vinyl pressings and expanded editions of the album's 2013 reissue.\n\nAlbini had last been in Ireland with Shellac in April of 2023, playing in Limerick and Dublin, and hand-picking noise-rockers M(h)aol to support.\n\nShellac's next album, 'To All Trains', is scheduled for release next week.", "source": {"uri":

He was a member of controversial bands Big Black and Rapeman in the '80s, and in 1997 founded Electrical Audio studios in Chicago. Albini also famously hated club culture, earning himself a generation of electronic music fans in the process. In an email to the UK artist Powell that later became a billboard, he said he'd \"always detested mechanized dance music, its stupid simplicity, the clubs where it was played, the people who went to those clubs, the drugs they took, the shit they liked to talk about, the battles they fought among themselves. Basically all of it: 100 percent hated every scrap.\" That said, in an interview with Marc Maron, Albini confessed to liking the original house scene in Chicago, calling it a \"genuine expression of joy\" before it was \"stylised and co-opted and turned into a formula.\" Read some social media tributes to Albini.", "source": {"uri": "ra.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Resident Advisor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electronic music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loraine_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loraine James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Optimo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitchfork_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitchfork (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapeman", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pixies (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_Audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrical Audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Black", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_recording", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Analog recording"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UK Singles Chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Do it yourself"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Maron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Maron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static.ra.co/images/news/2024/steve-albini-photo.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Here's a look at the stars we've lost so far in 2024, through April.\n\nSteve Albini, an acclaimed musician who helmed some of the most revered albums across America's alternative music scene, has died after suffering a heart attack at his recording studio. He was 61.\n\nStaff at the studio, Electrical Audio, have confirmed to Pitchfork that Albini died on Tuesday.\n\nThe late musician fronted bands such as Big Black, Rapeman and Shellac, while he also produced albums for the likes of Nirvana, Pixies, PJ Harvey, and Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.\n\nAlbini was heavily influenced by the punk movement during his younger years, and he ultimately founded his own music project called Big Black, firstly as a solo effort before it eventually became a quartet.\n\nThe group released their debut album, \"Atomizer\" in 1986, and they're now recognized as one of the most influential punk groups of the era.\n\nDespite this, the group split and in 1987, Albini formed a new band called Rapeman.\n\nAlbini then formed Shellac in 1992 alongside drummer Todd Trainer and bassist Bob Weston. Together, they released five albums and the group are actually scheduled to release their latest record, \"To All Trains,\" next week.\n\nAlbini is probably best know for producing the final studio album by Nirvana, \"In Utero,\" which was released in 1993.\n\nIn 1995, Albini established his own recording studio and he worked with several high-profile acts, including Joanna Newsom, Low, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Manic Street Preachers and Jarvis Cocker.\n\nAway from the music scene, Albini also enjoyed huge success as a poker player, winning two bracelets at World Series of Poker tournaments, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money.\n\nAlbini is survived by his wife, movie-maker Heather Whinna.\n\nPhotos: Notable deaths in 2024\n\nBrian Mulroney\n\nFeb 29, 2024\n\nIris Apfel\n\nMar 4, 2024\n\nAndy Russell\n\nMar 4, 2024\n\nEd Ott\n\nMar 4, 2024\n\nChris Mortensen\n\nMar 4, 2024\n\nJerry Grote\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nSchappell Twins\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nPeter Higgs\n\nApr 9, 2024\n\nRalph Puckett Jr.\n\nApr 10, 2024\n\nO.J.

His death was confirmed by the studio's staff members.\n\nAlbini wrote a four-page proposal to the grunge trio when he agreed to work on 'In Utero' with them in which he explained his philosophies around recording music. Most notably, he declared that \"if a record takes more than a week to make, somebody's fucking up\".\n\n\"I think the very best thing you could do at this point is exactly what you are talking about doing: bang a record out in a couple of days, with high quality but minimal 'production' and no interference from the front office bulletheads,\" he wrote. \"If that is indeed what you want to do, I would love to be involved.\n\n\"If, instead, you might find yourselves in the position of being temporarily indulged by the record company, only to have them yank the chain at some point (hassling you to rework songs/sequences/production, calling-in hired guns to 'sweeten' your record, turning the whole thing over to some remix jockey, whatever...) then you're in for a bummer and I want no part of it.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I'm only interested in working on records that legitimately reflect the band's own perception of their music and existence. If you will commit yourselves to that as a tenet of the recording methodology, then I will bust my ass for you. I'll work circles around you. I'll rap your head with a ratchet...\n\n\"I have worked on hundreds of records (some great, some good, some horrible, a lot in the courtyard), and I have seen a direct correlation between the quality of the end result and the mood of the band throughout the process. If the record takes a long time, and everyone gets bummed and scrutinizes every step, then the recordings bear little resemblance to the live band, and the end result is seldom flattering. Making punk records is definitely a case where more 'work' does not imply a better end result. Clearly you have learned this yourselves and appreciate the logic.\"\n\nAlbini went on to outline his principles, which include his belief that \"the band [is] the most important thing\", the need to \"leave room for accidents or chaos\", why he didn't like remixing another engineer's recordings and why he wouldn't dictate the sound of a record to his tastes. He also wrote that it didn't matter where an album was recorded as much as how it is recorded.\n\nHe also spoke about money, writing: \"I do not want and will not take a royalty on any record I record. No points. Period. I think paying a royalty to a producer or engineer is ethically indefensible. The band write the songs. The band play the music. It's the band's fans who buy the records. The band is responsible for whether it's a great record or a horrible record. Royalties belong to the band.\n\n\"I would like to be paid like a plumber: I do the job and you pay me what it's worth.\"\n\nHis final line was: \"If a record takes more than a week to make, somebody's fucking up.\"\n\nAlbini spoke to NME last year about his life and career. On the subject of recording what turned out to be Nirvana's final album, he said: \"There wasn't anything out of the ordinary about the sessions. I mean, apart from them being extremely famous. I had to do everything I could to keep it under wraps to make sure that we didn't get overrun by fans and the added nonsense. That was the only thing that was weird about it.\"\n\nKurt Cobain had been a known admirer of Albini's music before he worked with Nirvana, having been in attendance when his band Big Black played their last ever show in 1987. During the first session, he brought with him a piece of the guitar Albini had smashed during the gig.\n\nLast year, Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic spoke to NME and recalled working with the producer and how the band landed on the post-'Nevermind' sound of the record. \"Kurt was a fan of Albini,\" he said. \"I remember being in a tour van in 1989 and Kurt was listening to Pixies.

Here's a list of his finest moments as a bandleader.\n\n\"Don't curse me for my nature/Don't blast me for my wrongs/Just a bad penny/I always come back to you,\" leers Steve Albini without apology on \"Bad Penny.\" The 1987 song is by Albini's first and most groundbreaking band, the mechanized post-punk juggernaut Big Black. It's also a comment on his well-earned reputation as a muckraker of the human soul. The piss-and-vinegar frontman of Big Black, Rapeman, and currently Shellac has spent the past third of a century not just pushing people's buttons, but pulverizing them.\n\nCalling one of his bands Rapeman is just the tip of the perversity iceberg. Albini's lyrics have long reveled in transgression, degradation, and the repressed rot at the heart of Middle American existence. Accordingly, his music is not pretty. From Big Black's drilling shrillness to Shellac's blunt-force post-rock, his body of work has mutated slowly over the decades, but it's never fundamentally changed. His head is full of worms; he puts them into song.\n\nAlbini's notoriety grew exponentially in the 1990s, though much of it had nothing to do with his music. He worked on a handful of epochal releases in the late 1980s, including Pixies' 1988 album, Surfer Rosa, and Slint's 1989 debut, Tweez, but it was his credits on Nirvana's 1993 swan song, In Utero, that launched him into the upper atmosphere of in-demand producers. From that platform, he wrote an instantly legendary article for the alternative magazine The Baffler that warned of the dangers of signing to a major label, just as the majors were in the midst of snatching up almost every indie band they could find.\n\nYet Albini himself continued to record major-label bands, a self-contradiction that became one of many. Some of his lyrics could be read as misogynist, but he maintained his only intention was to confront sanctimony and hypocrisy. At the same time, he held himself to a strict ethical code when it came to his dealings within the music industry. That idealism was starkly contrasted by the harrowing negativity of Big Black, which began as a solo project while Albini attended Northwestern University.\n\nInspired by Chicago's up-and-coming punk powerhouse Naked Raygun, he soon enlisted two of that band's members, Jeff Pezzati and Santiago Durango (with bassist Dave Riley replacing Pezzati in 1985), to turn Big Black into a full band. Instead of a drummer, Albini used a drum machine -- a strange choice in the punk scene at the time, but one that helped give Big Black a distinctly cold edge.", "source": {"uri": "pitchfork.com",

In an astonishing development, he will be collaborating posthumously with the legendary Ghost of Elvis. This news has captivated fans from both the earthly and celestial realms. It broke on May 7, 2024, revealing that the legendary musician and producer had made the transition to the great recording studio in the sky.\n\nSteve Albini, renowned for his minimalist recording techniques and his influential work with bands such as the Pixies and Nirvana, was a champion of artist rights and a critic of the mainstream music industry. Albini's dedication to authenticity in music production left a lasting mark on the alternative and indie rock scenes. Sadly, Steve Albini passed away due to a heart attack on May 7, 2024.\n\nThe news of Steve Albini's passing shocked his fans, but the ghost of Elvis, seen at Graceland, appeared thrilled about their posthumous partnership. Elvis revolutionized the music scene with his dynamic fusion of rock, country, blues, and gospel, and his impact extended into fashion and cultural integration, cementing his status as a icon.\n\nQuickly adapting to their new spiritual surroundings, Albini and Elvis wasted no time in setting up a studio in the heavenly version of Graceland. Eyewitnesses report seeing apparitions that resemble the duo, fine-tuning tracks and adjusting sound levels. This otherworldly collaboration is rumored to produce captivating melodies that have even the angels playing along.\n\nA celestial insider shared, \"Elvis has always been associated with unique sounds, and Steve Albini is the perfect counterpart to accentuate the King's style. Together, they are blending ethereal tunes with Albini's trademark gritty guitar riffs -- a sound truly out of this world.\"\n\nThe album is tentatively titled \"Burning Love, In Utero.\" The work aims to merge Albini's passion for raw, unfiltered music with Elvis's timeless appeal. Expected tracks include \"Two Nuns in Blue Suede Shoes (Cloud Version)\" and \"Heartbreak, Heart-shaped Box (Heaven Edition).\" And an intriguing new piece, \"Stairway from Heaven,\" distinct from Led Zeppelin's classic.\n\nGraceland has yet to confirm these recording sessions, the excitement is fun, stirring spirits and curiosity across realms. Fans and skeptics are eagerly awaiting a chance to experience what could be an interdimensional chart-topper.\n\n\"Steve always aimed to break free from the traditional confines of the music industry,\" a source close to Albini said. \"Collaborating with Elvis in the afterlife? It doesn't get more unconventional than that.\"\n\nAs impossible as it might seem, if anyone could mastermind a celestial musical revival, it would be the innovative Steve Albini and Elvis Presley.

He seemed to have a bemused realization of his own staunch judgement towards factionalism, us versus them, the capitalist colonization agenda of the recording industry coexisting with the socialist minded independent music world.\"\n\nThurston's former Sonic Youth bandmate Lee Ranaldo also shared a tribute, writing, \"I note the passing of old friend Steve Albini - certainly gone too soon. Our bands met up in the mid-80s and paths crossed frequently since. Some years back Steve made+gifted us the Sonic Sixteen - a modified Strat copy with 16 high E strings (or-whatever note(s) one wished!), and penis-inlaid headstock. So Steve. Very sad news today.\"\n\n\"He was the smartest, most cynical producer/music critic/band leader/pundit, everyone was scared of him. Then you see pictures of him and he just looks like this skinny little guy. He's just smarter and funnier and better at everything than everyone else in the world.\" said Grohl.\n\nAlso rock band The Breeders went on social media to pay tribute to Albini: \"The Breeders are mourning the sudden passing of Steve Albini.

Staff at his studio, Electrical Audio, confirmed the news to Pitchfork.\n\nAs well as fronting the bands Big Black, Rapeman and Shellac, who all pushed at the boundaries of post-punk and art-rock, Albini also produced - or, to use his preferred term, engineered - albums for dozens of artists including Nirvana, Pixies, PJ Harvey and Page and Plant. He was noted for his DIY and punk ethos, resisting streaming services and refusing to take royalties from the recordings he produced for other artists.\n\nShellac were preparing their first album since 2014, To All Trains, for release next week.\n\nBorn in California in 1962, Albini's musical inspirations came from the punk movement, chiefly the Ramones but also the weirder end of the genre with bands such as Devo and Pere Ubu. He moved to the suburbs of Chicago to study journalism, and was drawn into the fertile underground music scene in the city, contributing to zines and working for the punk label Ruthless Records.\n\nRead more: https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/may/08/steve-albini-us-alt-rock-musician-and-producer-dies-aged-61", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_Audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrical Audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shellac (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitchfork_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitchfork (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recording studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alternative rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapeman", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pixies (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIY_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DIY (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_and_Plant", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Page and Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Black", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Art rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-punk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Post-punk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ_Harvey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PJ Harvey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punk rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruthless_Records", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruthless Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pere_Ubu", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pere Ubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Underground music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramones", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ramones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_subculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punk subculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Related_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Related Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

I remember being in a tour van in 1989 and Kurt was listening to Pixies. He raised his finger and said, 'This shall be our snare sound!' He wanted to do it with Steve for a long time.\n\n\"There's that whole thing where you get famous and you have to transition into it. It was hard for everyone, but Kurt got all the attention, being up front there. I don't comment on the lyrics as they're open for interpretation, but you can listen and make up your own mind. 'Radio Friendly Unit Shifter' was a smart-ass statement that Kurt made, and really says it all. We signed a record contract and had all these expectations.\"\n\nHe added: \"What came after we made the record was the stuff of legend, but you just get back to the band. It's a beautiful thing that someone invented this concept of drums, bass, guitar and vocals. This was our version of that.\"\n\nSpeaking to NME previously, Albini spoke of how he was more of an \"engineer\" than a producer to Nirvana, and recalled how Cobain came to him as a vocal admirer of his work with previous band, Big Black.\n\n\"When my band Big Black did a farewell tour years before the 'In Utero' sessions, the final show was in some industrial space in Seattle,\" he said. \"It was in a weird building with a makeshift stage. It was a cool gig and at end we smashed up all of our gear. I distinctively recall some kid asking me if he could take a piece of my guitar off the stage and me saying 'go ahead its garbage now'.\n\n\"Many years later when we were working on 'In Utero' at the studio in Minnesota, Kurt showed me this little piece of this guitar that he had saved. He had brought it with him after all those years. He had been that kid.\"\n\nMeanwhile, earlier today (May 9) Nirvana's social media accounts shared the four-page letter Albini sent to them, proposing that he produce 'In Utero'.\n\nIn the letter, he famously declared that \"if a record takes more than a week to make, somebody's fucking up\".\n\n\"I think the very best thing you could do at this point is exactly what you are talking about doing: bang a record out in a couple of days, with high quality but minimal 'production' and no interference from the front office bulletheads,\" he wrote. \"If that is indeed what you want to do, I would love to be involved.\"", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "damian_jones@nme.com", "name": "Damian Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krist_Novoselic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Krist Novoselic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Cobain", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Cobain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pixies (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snare_drum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snare drum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Black", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NME", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NME"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bass guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drum kit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recording contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concert tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home_Recording", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home Recording", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_nirvana_stevealbini_getty_2000x1270.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 97, "textEnd": 102}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 2088, "textEnd": 2093}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

When his first band broke up, he went a step further by naming his next Rapeman, after a Japanese comic which today it's hard to believe even existed - or indeed that he would defend that choice of nomenclature to the last as an artistic one, designed to provoke thought. In the MeToo era, it simply wouldn't happen.\n\nYet here, in person, this legendary agent provocateur from Chicago turned out to be diminutive and benign. He was on a fleeting, low-budget visit to London to promote the defiantly anti-corporate All Tomorrow's Parties festival, which he and his latest band, Shellac, were curating at Pontin's holiday camp in Camber Sands. He'd brought his partner along for the trip to do some shopping and see the sights, and she was face down on their double bed, wiped out with jetlag. \"I'm sorry, honey,\" he whispered in her ear apologetically, \"I have to talk about myself for an hour or so - if that doesn't send you off to sleep, nothing will\".\n\nIn conversation, he talked with meticulous reasoning and wicked humour, but also a ferocious lack of compromise. If punk was rock's version of the French Revolution, then Albini was its Robespierre, who rose to prominence after the first onslaught with an even stronger, near-puritanical drive to overthrow the lazy attitudes and practices of the old order.\n\nQuite apart from the hideous songs about child abuse, arson and small-town violence, he revelled in confusing and winding up his audience whenever the opportunity arose. One record cover declared, \"Steve uses and endorses heroin\" (not true: he was, and apparently remained, teetotal on all fronts). Another album sleeve, in place of the usual lyric sheet, featured the warning: \"Our lyrics are none of your business.\"\n\n\"That still makes perfect sense to me,\" he told me. \"All that mattered to us was that there be some vocals, as an instrument of emotional intensity. So we'd pick topics that were of interest to us, things we'd talked about, specific incidents, newspaper stories, or abstract ideas. \"Uniquely in rock bands,\" he went on, \"are people held accountable for the subject matter they're writing about. I agree with you that Big Black's music was intentionally offensive, but should one deduce from that that the members of Big Black are themselves intentionally offensive? Does one think that Quentin Tarantino is a f---ing gangster? No! That's crazy talk. Nabokov would not have written Lolita if he'd felt like he himself would be perceived as a pervert. Although, I suppose he still is in certain small-minded circles.\"\n\nAlbini was essentially crusading for rock music to be taken like all good Art, as a forum for complex modes of expression. \"There's an assumption among critics that rock musicians aren't really artists,\" he argued. \"They're lunkheads, and by extension, all those listeners are idiots, and don't know their asses from trees. Which is why you end up with all these protectionist moves like, 'Don't sing about racial issues unless you're black and singing from an oppressed perspective, because people will misinterpret'. In one stroke, that's saying you, the musician, are not smart enough to handle the issue, and your audience is not smart enough to read you correctly. It's telling you, 'Don't deal with matters that might be sensitive, unless you have a perspective that isn't going to inflame anyone' - as though inflaming someone was in itself not a good thing!\"\n\nHe pushed this reasoning to the point of outright confrontation with Rapeman. In the late Eighties, several of the band's UK gigs were picketed by women's rights campaigners. \"If any of those people had stopped to speak to me,\" he argued, \"they would've found that, on almost all issues of significance, I probably agreed with them. I still feel stupid defending the name. Protesting a rock band because of its name, and because of your assumptions of the character of its members, is silly. I'm not going to live my life in fear of somebody else being stupid.\"\n\nUnder substantial pressure on an underground level, Rapeman split up after only one album, but Albini had developped a parallel career as a producer - or 'engineer', as he humbly always credited himself - initially for alternative artists. Around the turn of the '90s, he oversaw a golden run of long-players, which included Surfer Rosa by Pixies, and PJ Harvey's Rid Of Me. He returned to the music press newspages in 1992, when he was hired by Nirvana to apply his raw recording methods to their follow-up to the game-changing, worldwide hit, Nevermind. But as the resultant In Utero neared release, he railed at the band's record company for tampering with his mixes.\n\n\"Even now,\" he sighed, at nine years' distance, \"it's hard for me to listen to that record. I think I did a good job on it, but then it was hinked with a lot after we finished. I feel like I'm listening to a lesser version of something that I was there for the original event of.\"\n\nNevertheless, alongside sporadic activity with Shellac, his production career mushroomed thereafter, taking in top-flight artists like Kate Bush, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant - who, with characteristic Albini perversity, for many at least, epitomised the dinosaur mindset he railed against - as well as innumerable unknowns, for whom he worked for next to nothing.\n\nAlong the way, he shunned publicity, and in our conversation repeatedly castigated \"the English press\" for its \"obsession with personalities.\" He dampened down any effort to lionize him as a superstar producer, saying that he simply provided a technical service, and people came to him \"in the same way that you go to a specific auto mechanic because he's familiar with your type of car\". Doubtless influenced by the experiences of some of his clients - most notably Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, who took his own life in terrible existential agony and drug addiction shortly after In Utero's release - he said he and his band mates would never dream of making a pop video to try and have a hit.\n\n\"We do it because we love playing shows and making records,\" he said. \"It's the thing that gives me the most satisfaction out of anything in my life. But it's just like cooking or skiing or billiards - you do it because you enjoy it. That's its own satisfaction. I can play billiards all night and not win a dollar, and I still have a great f---ing time. I wouldn't quit playing billiards if there wasn't any money in it, because there isn't any money it!\n\n\"So to answer your question directly: there's no reason to make a video, there's no place to play such a video for a band like ours, so making one would be an exercise in self-gratification akin to making sculptures of ourselves.\"\n\nFor these staunch outsider ideas, and his ever-colourful ways of expressing them, Albini continued to be revered as a refusenik icon. He would make outspoken remarks about certain people he crossed paths with - post-In Utero, he famously daubed Cobain's wife, Courtney Love, \"a psycho hosebeast\"- but these were very few. Most people emerged from his orbit loving him, and respecting him. Even after the Rapeman controversy, he remained close friends with Pixies' staunchly feminist bass player, Kim Deal, for instance, while Nirvana's drummer, Dave Grohl, who went onto become one the world's biggest rock stars with Foo Fighters, devoted pretty much the whole Chicago episode of his 2014 city-by-city TV guide to the United States, Sonic Highways, to documenting Albini's vision.\n\nBy now, the man himself had been talking for a good couple of hours. It was getting into late evening, and his partner really was totally sparko. He rabbited about the All Tomorrow's Parties festival which Shellac were curating, where they'd picked 30 or more bands who otherwise wouldn't have the budget to realise their own artistic ideas before a UK audience.\n\n\"Take The Upper Crust,\" he enthused, \"who are a hard-rocking 17th-century aristocratic band. They look like Louis XIV, and they sound like AC/DC. They wear powdered wigs, breeches and waistcoats, and have serfs that come and shovel coal under their amplifiers. We have the luxury of having this funded environment for the festival, so the Upper Crust will be here, and so will their serfs.\"\n\nAssuming the role of any kind of figurehead or underground messiah for all that beneficence, though, was anathema to him. He didn't want to be a spokesperson for his generation - a Bob Dylan, a Joe Strummer, or indeed a Kurt Cobain. Some have argued that he preferred to snipe from the margins than to engage with mainstream culture, but when I suggested to him that he'd come to embody the spirit of punk, he shifted awkwardly in his hotel room chair and even glanced over at his snoozing partner lest she hear him be thus aggrandized.\n\n\"I'm not comfortable with that,\" he replied finally, and he clearly wasn't. \"It makes me blush and feel weird. There's an entire population of people who think and behave along very similar lines, and I'm just one of those people. We like to do things ourselves. We like to keep control of our creative lives. We like to treat each other, and everyone else, like individuals, rather than a generic mass. Obviously, I'm one of those people who think that way, but I don't feel that my being involved in it is any more significant than the hundreds and hundreds and thousands of other people who behave like that as well.\"\n\nThe Upper Crust, however, and countless others he championed, fell by the wayside, scarcely gaining any recognition whatsoever. Albini, by contrast, with his unwavering ideologies, will always be remembered as an inspiration by those who knew and understood him.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Though noted most of all for his penchant for punk-tinged revelry, the list showcases what Albini truly championed in the world of music: authenticity.\n\nThough forever aligned with Pixies, Nirvana and PJ Harvey for his production work, Albini was never a producer who categorised himself by genre. His warts-and-all approach to sitting behind the mixing desk may have best suited the alternative rock sounds emanating from the 1990s, but he was always open to the sounds of society's furthest corners.\n\nTo prove that, Albini once shared a list of his favourite tracks of all time. Of course, like any real muso, he caveated his selection by stating that he tried to avoid songs that he had worked on. However, given that he estimates that he worked on several thousand songs over the years, this was easier said than done.\n\nAlong with the aforementioned giants of alt-rock, Albini also found himself in the studio with legendary performers such as the Wedding Present, The Breeders, Cheap Trick, Jarvis Cocker, Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, and Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and hundreds of others.\n\nWhen Far Out spoke to the Wedding Present's David Gedge, he explained what it was like working with Albini: \"We just really got on,\" he said. \"He's got this reputation of being difficult to work with, but he was absolutely perfect for us.\"\n\nGedge continued: \"It's all boring stuff really, but he just knows about EQ's and where to put microphones so that a drumkit sounds right, all the boring stuff that I have no interest in really.\" As Albini said himself, one of the key tenets of his work is to bond with the artists over shared formative experiences and influences.\n\nThis has made him a very in-demand producer, and there is one track he worked on that he had to make an exception for, as he stated on Twitter: \"Did 20 songs, tried not to include any I worked on but made an exception for Nina.\"\n\nOn the list are some incredible songs. The heartbreakingly beautiful 'Jolene' from Dolly Parton finds a spot on the list alongside fellow country hero Johnny Cash and his song 'Rock Island Line'. Post-punk is also represented by Wiper's hit 'Romeo' on the list with 'Rocket USA' by Suicide, as well as The Birthday Party and The Modern Lovers.\n\nWith Stevie Wonder, Bill Wither, and even The Proclaimers included, the list is a showcase of just how wide-reaching Albini's musical tastes truly were.

In the fall of 2007, the magazine I was working for was doing a feature on -- if memory serves, as it's a bit foggy -- trying things out for the first time. So one staffer would take on fronting a band at a club, another would give standup comedy a go. That sort of thing. I immediately volunteered to take on playing poker. The decidedly unglamorous casinos of Gary, Indiana, were only a half-hour drive from Chicago, where I was living at the time. And besides, I knew a great teacher: Steve Albini.\n\nKnew is being generous. A few weeks earlier, Albini engineered a four-track EP by the band I was in at his space, Electrical Audio. So I knew him so far as I spent one very long day and night in his company getting those tracks down and then one very short afternoon watching him do a rough mix, basically nodding along blindly to every suggestion or note he had. Countless bands knew him that way. But I was well aware that he was a poker fiend. He talked about it throughout our band's session, and his poker nights with fellow musicians, held in his kitchen above the studio, were something of an indie-rock legend. (He also was legitimately great at it: As recently as 2022, he won one of the World Series of Poker tournaments.)\n\nSo I emailed him, sheepishly and apologetically and way too lengthily, about whether he remembered me and would be into walking me through the game. A minute later, he shot back a short response, something along the lines of, \"Happy to. I'll call you.\" That call ended up lasting a good hour, with Albini rattling off the poker books to avoid and the ones to seek out, if I was really serious about getting good. (I wasn't, but I did appreciate the thoroughness.) Most of this went over my head, and my mind kept returning to the question: Why is he doing this? He wasn't promoting anything. He wasn't getting anything of it. There is, of course, a simple answer: He loved talking, and thinking about, the art and strategy of poker. And he was more than happy to set aside chunks of precious time for those that he felt shared that same passion. He loved what he loved. And to hell with the rest. It's just noise. That's a philosophy you could easily use to describe his career in music.\n\nWhich is all to say: When I heard the news yesterday that Albini had died at the age of 61, my heart sank. Suddenly, flashes of that summer of 2007 came flooding in -- of smoking a Camel Light early in the morning outside the space in the harsh morning sunshine, my heart racing and palms sweaty; of unpacking and setting up, turning the reverb up to level eight on my amp, which happens to be sitting in the next room as I type this; of our drummer nailing his first take in that custom-made drum room, and the thrill of hearing those \"Albini drums\" (there is no other drum sound like it) playing loud and clear behind the studio glass; of the engineer telling me to calm down and take a breath when I kept fucking up a guitar part I'd played a million times; of him instructing me to strum a little looser and less Strokesy, a small suggestion that made one of our songs infinitely better and more natural sounding; and of joking around and being young and dumb in front of a guy who grew up to do the thing we all wanted to do.\n\nMuch has -- and will continue to be -- written about the seminal albums he worked on. The In Uteros. The Surfer Rosas. But when I think of that time, of the excitement of hearing from our bassist that he'd record us, my mind immediately goes to the albums he engineered over the preceding few months and years. Here are just a few songs from those records:\n\nPart of Albini's engineering philosophy was simple: capturing the best version of a band playing live. That's no more evident than in this stunning album opener from the late Jason Molina's project, which ebbs and flows beautifully (and over just three chords for most of its run, no less).\n\nIf Albini had just recorded the Ponys' second record, Celebration Castle, I would have still been plenty nervous to play in front of him. They were my favorite local band at the time and very much a template for what I wanted us to be like. I love this track, sung by Ian Adams, who'd exit the band after this record.\n\nAnd now for something completely different. Ys was my album of the year in my friends' top-five poll for 2006. And Albini captures Newsom's delicate vocals and harp playing just gorgeously here.\n\nThose drums! Nobody recorded them quite like him. This track from the Brighton outfit is still in regular rotation for me (and it tops out at just two chords).\n\nFor Albini, our session in summer 2027 was just another day, another clock-in for a guy whose workload was staggeringly busy by design and for philosophical reasons (about art, about commerce, and about how the two shouldn't mix): Your band would pop in, he'd make them sound as good as they ever would live, and you'd pop out. Another young band would surely be waiting, nervously, for you to come down to your studio the next morning. But for us -- and, I'm sure, so many others -- leaving Electrical Audio and driving around late at night, blasting a CD of what we just recorded that day, what didn't exist that morning, by a guy who was very much a hero, was magical. It was just like that scene in 24 Hour Party People, only we weren't, you know, Joy Division.\n\nMore often than not, those big moments in life, the ones you'll remember and pick apart decades down the line like you're the narrator in a Bruce Springsteen song, don't feel like it when they're happening. This was different. This absolutely felt big, special, like the sort of thing you'll tell your son or daughter about if you ever have one. And so my friends and I ducked into a late-night bar off Belmont and Western, a stone's throw from Electrical Audio, and we clinked our glasses of PBR and smoked our cigarettes and annoyingly asked the bartender to play those four songs on repeat and made fun of each other and talked shit about bands and felt that glorious buzz you do when you're young and dumb and made something you're proud of. I will never forget that moment.", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

The punk legend's death was confirmed the following day, provoking an onslaught of memories and memorial posts that paid tribute to his historic standings. Amongst the messages was a four-page letter Albini sent to Nirvana before he agreed to record their final album, the acclaimed In Utero set.\n\nPopulated from Nirvana's official Twitter/X account, the famed Washington state-rockers letter, marked Nov. 17, 1992, and addressed to Kurt Cobain, Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic (scribed Chris in the note), and outline's Albini's approach, in part, \"if a record takes more than a week to make, somebody's fucking up.\"\n\nAlbini proposes, \"I think the very best thing you could do at this point is exactly what you are talking about doing: bang a record out in a couple of days, with high quality but minimal 'production' and no interference from the front office bulletheads.\" Confirming his inclusion, Abini added, \"If that is indeed what you want to do, I would love to be involved.\"\n\n\"If, instead, you might find yourselves in the position of being temporarily indulged by the record company, only to have them yank the chain at some point (hassling you to rework songs/sequences/production, calling-in hired guns to 'sweeten' your record, turning the whole thing over to some remix jockey, whatever...) then you're in for a bummer and I want no part of it.\"\n\nHe continued his proposal, \"I'm only interested in working on records that legitimately reflect the band's own perception of their music and existence. If you will commit yourselves to that as a tenet of the recording methodology, then I will bust my ass for you. I'll work circles around you.\"\n\nTapping into his preferred methodology, Albini added, \"I consider the band the most important thing, as the creative entity that spawned both the band's personality and style and as the social entity that exists 24 hours out of each day. I do not consider it my place to tell you what to do or how to play. I'm quite willing to let my opinions be heard (if I think the band is making beautiful progress or a heaving mistake, I consider it part of my job to tell them) but if the band decides to pursue something, I'll see that it gets done.\"\n\nSticking to his word, the band and Albini partnered on the project, which resulted in In Utero, the third and final studio LP from Nirvana, known for classics such as \"Heart-Shaped Box\" and \"All Apologies.\" Released on September 21, 1993, six months prior to Cobain's suicide.", "source": {"uri": "relix.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Relix Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hana_gustafson@relix.com", "name": "Hana Gustafson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Underground music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krist_Novoselic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Krist Novoselic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Grohl", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dave Grohl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Cobain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Cobain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punk rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Remix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart-Shaped_Box", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heart-Shaped Box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Apologies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All Apologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Kurt_Cobain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide of Kurt Cobain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Classics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LP_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LP record"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://relix.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Promo-Facebook-Facebook-link-image-2024-05-09T113833.595.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 12, "textEnd": 17}, {"amb": false, "date": "1992-11-17", "textStart": 533, "textEnd": 546}, {"amb": false, "date": "1993-09-21", "textStart": 2550, "textEnd": 2568}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

The band's best-known song, the ugly, explosive, six-minute \"Kerosene\" from their cult favorite album, 1986's \"Atomizer,\" is ideal evidence -- and not for the faint of heart.", "source": {"uri": "nationalpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shellac (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_Lizard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Jesus Lizard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superchunk", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superchunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joanna Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breeders", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Breeders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_folk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indie folk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogwai", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mogwai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northwestern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Do it yourself"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punk rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_Exposure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forced Exposure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Black", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostinato", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ostinato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drum machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taboo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-punk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Post-punk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drummer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_following", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cult following"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

If you were between 13 and 33 years old in the 80s and 90s and dug what was then known as \"alternative\" music, then he probably had his hand in some of your favorite music from your favorite bands, including from Nirvana, PJ Harvey and the Pixies. He also fronted his own bands, one of which, Shellac, apparently has a new album coming out next week.\n\nI knew Albini extremely tangentially, in that we both hung out on Bluesky and had some back-and-forth there. It was fun to see someone who actually had a significant role in the culture I and others of my generation participated in hanging out, shooting the shit, and making observations both on the music industry and the culture in general. Albini was known to give unvarnished opinions on the industry he worked in (his essay \"The Problem With Music\" is a classic piece about how the music industry mostly sucked for every band in it), and he was also remarkably self-observant about being a white dude in the culture, what that let him get away with when he was younger, and how he needed to own that past and work on where he was now. These days, that's not nothing.\n\nSo, anyway, this really sucks and as a music lover, I'm sad about this. Also, as someone who chatted him up online a few times and enjoyed his posts otherwise, I'm also sad. As I noted on Bluesky, this is very much like hearing that your neighbor has unexpectedly passed.

Both as a performer and a recording engineer (and producer, though he was less fond of that specific title), Albini, who passed away yesterday, May 8th, at the age of 61, leaves behind a body of work that's as staggeringly massive as it is insanely impressive. Seriously, he's almost certainly either played on or recorded one of your favorite records.\n\nAs a member of Big Black, Albini helped define the Chicago indie scene with abrasive, drum-machine-backed noise punk; with Rapeman, he made like Ian MacKaye and made the transition from hardcore to post-hardcore look easy; and, finally, with Shellac, he perfected his Albini-esque mix of punk subgenres (noise rock, punk, post-rock, math rock, [insert other fucked up style of guitar music here]).\n\nAnd yet, as influential as his piercing, metallic guitar tone and ferocious performances were, Albini's biggest contributions to the world of music arguably came from his work behind the boards. As a recording engineer, he pioneered revolutionary techniques and upheld a unique, strong-willed philosophy that put artists and their creations well ahead of the almighty dollar. Famously, he would refuse to take royalty percentages on the music he worked on, instead opting for a one-time upfront payment. To do otherwise would be \"ethically untenable,\" he said. Considering some of the records he worked on, Pixies' Surfer Rosa and Nirvana's In Utero (!!), it's a decision that likely left quite a bit of money in the pockets of artists.\n\nWith the sheer number of truly incredible records that bear his fingerprints, rounding up the best of Albini's catalog is a nearly impossible task. We might as well have just linked to the lengthy \"discography\" section on his Wikipedia page, said 'here ya go,' and called it a day. Narrowing it down to any reasonable number inevitably leaves out countless albums that, on any other artist's list, could have been in the top five. If we had the space, we'd be gushing about his work with Melt-Banana, Poster Children, Don Caballero, Jawbreaker, Oxbow, Brainiac, Bush, Dirty Three, Bedhead, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page, Godspeed You!

Sonic trickery was left to the musicians - his task was to capture performance.\n\nWith a firm dedication to the art of analogue recording and production, he championed his approach throughout his career, insisting that his job was to be a 'vector of history'; recording and cataloguing music in a way that would serve as an archive for future generations.\n\nBorn in Pasedena, California, Albini picked up his first instrument as a young teenager whilst suffering a broken leg, and after discovering the power punk music of The Ramones and the Sex Pistols he began performing with local bands. His education would lead him to a degree in journalism which would fuel his work with music publications and embolden his support for local music scenes and the phenomenon of 'zines'.\n\nFronting three bands of his own - Big Black, Shellac, and Rapeman (the name for which he later expressed regret, describing it as an unconscionable and indefensible choice) - he became a fixture of the ever growing alternative rock scene of America throughout the 80s and early 90s.\n\nHis move into production began during the mid-80s, mostly working with underground bands such as The Membranes and Slint, to whom his approach to bottling the energy of their often frenetic, irregular and dark music became a much loved aspect of the resulting recordings.\n\nBy 1988, his burgeoning reputation as a recording engineer lead him to undertaking recording duties for what is now regarded as the one of the greatest alternative rock albums of all time: 'Surfer Rosa', by the Pixies. Despite a distinct lack of commercial success the impact of the album, and in particular how it sounded, would go on to become the bedrock of his legacy.\n\nOften eschewing royalty rights for his work - preferring below average payment for 'recording duties' - he also preferred not to have any production credits detailed on bands' album artwork. After all, his mantra was to do his utmost to record the music accurately - not interfere with the artistic process. This humble approach to his craft only gained him greater respect from the musicians who chose to employ his services.\n\nUsing the money he had earned he set up Electric Audio in Chicago in 1997, a facility dedicated to capturing musical performance in an entirely analogue fashion, with rooms designed and built to accentuate natural reverberations instead of relying on post-production to enhance the recordings. Yet, even with ever increasing costs over the years, he still refused to take any royalty credits - only ever billing for the recording duties undertaken.\n\nAnd despite dedicating most of his time to recording thousands of artists Albini continued to record and perform live with his band Shellac, releasing six albums between 1997 and 2014. His presence at renowned festivals such as All Tomorrows Parties and Primavera would draw as many musicians to the crowd as it did ticket paying fans.\n\nKnown for being a devilishly brilliant poker player, it is somewhat poignant that his own, last hand was to be played at his studio where he passed away after suffering a heart attack aged just 61, only a week before Shellac are due to release their first album in 10 years.\n\nThe subsequent outpouring of grief and appreciation from both those he worked with and musicians from all genres of music surely cements his chosen legacy as a vector of history. He will be much missed.", "source": {"uri": "today.rtl.lu", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTL Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pixies (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Plant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_recording", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Analog recording"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Page", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Page"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Led Zeppelin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramones", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ramones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Pistols", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sex Pistols"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ_Harvey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PJ Harvey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alternative rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punk rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapeman", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shellac (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Membranes", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Membranes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Black", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slint", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Underground music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Tomorrow's_Parties", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All Tomorrow's Parties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primavera_Sound", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primavera Sound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.rtl.lu/sassets/rtl2008.lu/nt/p/2024/05/09/11/38378d76cdc1cbf0428670ff1f48b125.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

When his first band broke up, he went a step further by naming his next Rapeman, after a Japanese comic which today it's hard to believe even existed - or indeed that he would defend that choice of nomenclature to the last as an artistic one, designed to provoke thought. In the MeToo era, it simply wouldn't happen.\n\nYet here, in person, this legendary agent provocateur from Chicago turned out to be diminutive and benign. He was on a fleeting, low-budget visit to London to promote the defiantly anti-corporate All Tomorrow's Parties festival, which he and his latest band, Shellac, were curating at Pontin's holiday camp in Camber Sands. He'd brought his partner along for the trip to do some shopping and see the sights, and she was face down on their double bed, wiped out with jetlag. \"I'm sorry, honey,\" he whispered in her ear apologetically, \"I have to talk about myself for an hour or so - if that doesn't send you off to sleep, nothing will\".\n\nIn conversation, he talked with meticulous reasoning and wicked humour, but also a ferocious lack of compromise. If punk was rock's version of the French Revolution, then Albini was its Robespierre, who rose to prominence after the first onslaught with an even stronger, near-puritanical drive to overthrow the lazy attitudes and practices of the old order.\n\nQuite apart from the hideous songs about child abuse, arson and small-town violence, he revelled in confusing and winding up his audience whenever the opportunity arose. One record cover declared, \"Steve uses and endorses heroin\" (not true: he was, and apparently remained, teetotal on all fronts). Another album sleeve, in place of the usual lyric sheet, featured the warning: \"Our lyrics are none of your business.\"\n\n\"That still makes perfect sense to me,\" he told me. \"All that mattered to us was that there be some vocals, as an instrument of emotional intensity. So we'd pick topics that were of interest to us, things we'd talked about, specific incidents, newspaper stories, or abstract ideas. \"Uniquely in rock bands,\" he went on, \"are people held accountable for the subject matter they're writing about. I agree with you that Big Black's music was intentionally offensive, but should one deduce from that that the members of Big Black are themselves intentionally offensive? Does one think that Quentin Tarantino is a f---ing gangster? No! That's crazy talk. Nabokov would not have written Lolita if he'd felt like he himself would be perceived as a pervert. Although, I suppose he still is in certain small-minded circles.\"\n\nAlbini was essentially crusading for rock music to be taken like all good Art, as a forum for complex modes of expression. \"There's an assumption among critics that rock musicians aren't really artists,\" he argued. \"They're lunkheads, and by extension, all those listeners are idiots, and don't know their asses from trees. Which is why you end up with all these protectionist moves like, 'Don't sing about racial issues unless you're black and singing from an oppressed perspective, because people will misinterpret'. In one stroke, that's saying you, the musician, are not smart enough to handle the issue, and your audience is not smart enough to read you correctly. It's telling you, 'Don't deal with matters that might be sensitive, unless you have a perspective that isn't going to inflame anyone' - as though inflaming someone was in itself not a good thing!\"\n\nHe pushed this reasoning to the point of outright confrontation with Rapeman. In the late Eighties, several of the band's UK gigs were picketed by women's rights campaigners. \"If any of those people had stopped to speak to me,\" he argued, \"they would've found that, on almost all issues of significance, I probably agreed with them. I still feel stupid defending the name. Protesting a rock band because of its name, and because of your assumptions of the character of its members, is silly. I'm not going to live my life in fear of somebody else being stupid.\"\n\nUnder substantial pressure on an underground level, Rapeman split up after only one album, but Albini had developped a parallel career as a producer - or 'engineer', as he humbly always credited himself - initially for alternative artists. Around the turn of the '90s, he oversaw a golden run of long-players, which included Surfer Rosa by Pixies, and PJ Harvey's Rid Of Me. He returned to the music press newspages in 1992, when he was hired by Nirvana to apply his raw recording methods to their follow-up to the game-changing, worldwide hit, Nevermind. But as the resultant In Utero neared release, he railed at the band's record company for tampering with his mixes.\n\n\"Even now,\" he sighed, at nine years' distance, \"it's hard for me to listen to that record. I think I did a good job on it, but then it was hinked with a lot after we finished. I feel like I'm listening to a lesser version of something that I was there for the original event of.\"\n\nNevertheless, alongside sporadic activity with Shellac, his production career mushroomed thereafter, taking in top-flight artists like Kate Bush, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant - who, with characteristic Albini perversity, for many at least, epitomised the dinosaur mindset he railed against - as well as innumerable unknowns, for whom he worked for next to nothing.\n\nAlong the way, he shunned publicity, and in our conversation repeatedly castigated \"the English press\" for its \"obsession with personalities.\" He dampened down any effort to lionize him as a superstar producer, saying that he simply provided a technical service, and people came to him \"in the same way that you go to a specific auto mechanic because he's familiar with your type of car\". Doubtless influenced by the experiences of some of his clients - most notably Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, who took his own life in terrible existential agony and drug addiction shortly after In Utero's release - he said he and his band mates would never dream of making a pop video to try and have a hit.\n\n\"We do it because we love playing shows and making records,\" he said. \"It's the thing that gives me the most satisfaction out of anything in my life. But it's just like cooking or skiing or billiards - you do it because you enjoy it. That's its own satisfaction. I can play billiards all night and not win a dollar, and I still have a great f---ing time. I wouldn't quit playing billiards if there wasn't any money in it, because there isn't any money it!\n\n\"So to answer your question directly: there's no reason to make a video, there's no place to play such a video for a band like ours, so making one would be an exercise in self-gratification akin to making sculptures of ourselves.\"\n\nFor these staunch outsider ideas, and his ever-colourful ways of expressing them, Albini continued to be revered as a refusenik icon. He would make outspoken remarks about certain people he crossed paths with - post-In Utero, he famously daubed Cobain's wife, Courtney Love, \"a psycho hosebeast\"- but these were very few. Most people emerged from his orbit loving him, and respecting him. Even after the Rapeman controversy, he remained close friends with Pixies' staunchly feminist bass player, Kim Deal, for instance, while Nirvana's drummer, Dave Grohl, who went onto become one the world's biggest rock stars with Foo Fighters, devoted pretty much the whole Chicago episode of his 2014 city-by-city TV guide to the United States, Sonic Highways, to documenting Albini's vision.\n\nBy now, the man himself had been talking for a good couple of hours. It was getting into late evening, and his partner really was totally sparko. He rabbited about the All Tomorrow's Parties festival which Shellac were curating, where they'd picked 30 or more bands who otherwise wouldn't have the budget to realise their own artistic ideas before a UK audience.\n\n\"Take The Upper Crust,\" he enthused, \"who are a hard-rocking 17th-century aristocratic band. They look like Louis XIV, and they sound like AC/DC. They wear powdered wigs, breeches and waistcoats, and have serfs that come and shovel coal under their amplifiers. We have the luxury of having this funded environment for the festival, so the Upper Crust will be here, and so will their serfs.\"\n\nAssuming the role of any kind of figurehead or underground messiah for all that beneficence, though, was anathema to him. He didn't want to be a spokesperson for his generation - a Bob Dylan, a Joe Strummer, or indeed a Kurt Cobain. Some have argued that he preferred to snipe from the margins than to engage with mainstream culture, but when I suggested to him that he'd come to embody the spirit of punk, he shifted awkwardly in his hotel room chair and even glanced over at his snoozing partner lest she hear him be thus aggrandized.\n\n\"I'm not comfortable with that,\" he replied finally, and he clearly wasn't. \"It makes me blush and feel weird. There's an entire population of people who think and behave along very similar lines, and I'm just one of those people. We like to do things ourselves. We like to keep control of our creative lives. We like to treat each other, and everyone else, like individuals, rather than a generic mass. Obviously, I'm one of those people who think that way, but I don't feel that my being involved in it is any more significant than the hundreds and hundreds and thousands of other people who behave like that as well.\"\n\nThe Upper Crust, however, and countless others he championed, fell by the wayside, scarcely gaining any recognition whatsoever. Albini, by contrast, with his unwavering ideologies, will always be remembered as an inspiration by those who knew and understood him.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

In the episode, Bourdain explores the sights of Chicago, stopping to dine on breaded steak sandwiches at Ricobene's with the music producer.\n\nIn the video clip, Bourdain asks Albini: \"Unusual for the music industry, remarkably lenient, Views on music sharing your pricing structure, as a producer is, you know, somewhat against the grain of the usual business model and you are not living in LA or New York or living on a mountaintop and peeing downwards from a great height though, what are you some kind of a communist split?\"\n\nThe music producer replies: \"I have a healthy suspicion of capitalism as a method I feel like left unchecked, capitalism is a kind of cultural sociopathy, like for a business to be successful in capitalist terms it has to do the best possible job of exploiting everyone that does interaction with the end game of capitalism is that everything is crappier and crappier and people are more and more exploited. And I have a healthy suspicion of that. So I feel like the social model that I'm comfortable with, it suits my business practices, which is that we're all in the same game. We're all trying to do the same thing. We just want to make sure that things get better for everybody.\"\n\nBourdain then asks if he thinks that mindset is a \"Chicago attitude\" to which Albini responded with: \"Well, in my circles, it is yeah, In the punk rock scene and the people who are influenced by the punk rock scene, that's a very common notion is that you're not trying to extract the maximum, you're trying to make sure that everything carries on.\"\n\nThe late chef goes on to say as if \"there is less douchery in Chicago,\" to which Albini replies: \"You can find jag-offs - that's a uniquely Chicago word. If you look for him, you can find jag-offs of all type in Chicago. But the people who are productive and content and part of an enterprise that is righteous for lack of a better term. They tend to not just give lip service to the notion of egalitarianism or fairness, but they tend to embody it.\"\n\n\"What about the musicians? How much money does a Guitar Hero deserve to make?,\" asked Bourdain. Albini responded: \"All of it obviously, because that's what people are listening to. People are listening to somebody's creative expression.\"\n\nSpeaking to NME last year, Albini opened up about teaming up with the Manics for their 2009 album 'Journal For Plague Lovers' and how they bonded over their similar political beliefs. \"I'm a leftist, they are leftist, so we aligned that way socially,\" he explained. \"More importantly, we'd had similar foundational experiences of being in bands, touring, being broke and having to make do, and doing things in a kind of home-made way.\n\n\"They had achieved enough success where they were sort of on this professional plain. They appreciated it all the more for having had to work their way up through it, you know busking on the street, playing crappy gigs, playing squats, working their way up to a point where they were a headline act. They were enjoying that, and they deserved to.\n\n\"No qualms whatsoever about just spitting on their hands and making their record, they didn't need fluffers or hangers-on!\"\n\nHe also opened up about feeling buoyed by the recent victory for the Democrat Brandon Johnson in the recent Chicago mayoral election - describing the mayoral race as \"a kind of watershed\" but also \"just a minor victory in Chicago\" for the city.\n\n\"The Republican candidate Paul Vallas, who is an extraordinary piece of shit, had enormous amounts of money put into his campaign,\" he argued. \"He's a typical Republican; pro-police, conservative law and order, the typical right-wing Chicago politics. He came up against a guy who was a former educator, county commissioner and teacher's union member.\n\n\"Johnson represented the progressive wing of the political scene in Chicago, the part that I identify with. It was really gratifying to see the political will of the people of the city overwhelm the kind of machine politics where you just infuse enough money into the chosen system and that guy wins. It was really great to see that defeated, it gives you hope.\"\n\nAnd of his own future, he added: \"As long as I have got all my facilities about me, I want to keep working.\"\n\nIn other news, PJ Harvey payed tribute to Albini by sharing \"He changed the course of my life\". He produced Harvey's 1993 LP 'Rid Of Me'.\n\nPulp frontman Jarvis Cocker also paid his respects, sharing: \"Listen to the music he was involved in & read what he wrote about it. It's worth it.\"\n\nThe Cribs also offered their condolences to the legendary producer, writing \"It's hard to imagine Steve Albini being gone\".", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news",

That matrimony magic would come to monumental fruition when the producer extraordinaire landed himself the role of helming their third and final record, In Utero. However, Albini was forced to work in order to land the lauded gig. Turning on the charm, the iconic Shellac musician left Kurt Cobain and his cronies no choice but to get him on board.\n\nIn Utero was a record that the whole world was seemingly waiting on. Nirvana, at the time, were firmly sitting at the pinnacle of the musical landscape after Nevermind drove the band to unthinkable success. This lofty acclaim was something that they never imagined in their wildest dreams when they first started out with their fresh brand of \"punk\" and aimed a dishevelled shot at the mainstream.\n\nEarly in 1992, Cobain told Rolling Stone that he was sure that the follow-up record would showcase \"both of the extremes\" of the band's sound, saying: \"It'll be more raw with some songs and more candy pop on some of the others. It won't be as one-dimensional [as Nevermind].\"\n\nIf anyone can capture the epitome of the 'rawness' Cobain was looking for, then that man was the late Steve Albini, a creative who was known for his maverick engineer work, a figure in the industry who sped ahead at a pace unlike anybody else. Picking Albini was a brave choice but one that certainly paid off, most notably on tracks such as 'Rape Me', which feel like the producer's imprint can be felt significantly.\n\nIn truth, it's hard to know whether In Utero could've worked without him. That's far from a purely musical proposition either-he was the perfect man to shed some of the pressure that the band were under in the studio. Part of the majesty of his production was simply making things easy, ideal for the energy a band like Nirvana had in abundance.\n\nAs David Gedge of The Wedding Present told us: \"He was absolutely perfect for us. It's all boring stuff really, but he just knows about EQ's and where to put microphones so that a drumkit sounds right, all the boring stuff that I have no interest in really.\" So, as Nirvana bundled into the studio, he already had everything taken care of. This was manna from heaven that resulted in a masterpiece-one that was already firmly forecast from the fact Albini had clearly been thinking about producing the band ever since he first heard them.\n\nHowever, before it was agreed that Albini would be at the helm for the record, the producer had to lay out his pitch to the band for what his vision of the album should be and, more importantly, why he was best placed to deliver the perfect follow up to Nevermind. Albini, leaving no stone unturned, delivered a wide-ranging letter which would not only land him the gig but see the team create the masterpiece that is In Utero in just a two-week period.\n\nThe letter is a fascinating read from start to finish; read it in full below.\n\nKurt, Dave and Chris:\n\nFirst let me apologize for taking a couple of days to put this outline together. When I spoke to Kurt I was in the middle of making a Fugazi album, but I thought I would have a day or so between records to sort everything out. My schedule changed unexpectedly, and this is the first moment I've had to go through it all. Apology.\n\nI think the very best thing you could do at this point is exactly what you are talking about doing: bang a record out in a couple of days, with high quality but minimal \"production\" and no interference from the front office bulletheads. If that is indeed what you want to do, I would love to be involved.\n\nIf, instead, you might find yourselves in the position of being temporarily indulged by the record company, only to have them yank the chain at some point (hassling you to rework songs/sequences/production, calling-in hired guns to \"sweeten\" your record, turning the whole thing over to some remix jockey, whatever...) then you're in for a bummer and I want no part of it.\n\nI'm only interested in working on records that legitimately reflect the band's own perception of their music and existance. If you will commit yourselves to that as a tenet of the recording methodology, then I will bust my ass for you. I'll work circles around you. I'll rap your head with a ratchet...\n\nI have worked on hundreds of records (some great, some good, some horrible, a lot in the courtyard), and I have seen a direct correlation between the quality of the end result and the mood of the band throughout the process. If the record takes a long time, and everyone gets bummed and scrutinizes every step, then the recordings bear little resemblance to the live band, and the end result is seldom flattering. Making punk records is definitely a case where more \"work\" does not imply a better end result. Clearly you have learned this yourselves and appreciate the logic.\n\nAbout my methodology and philosophy:\n\n#1: Most contemporary engineers and producers see a record as a \"project,\" and the band as only one element of the project. Further, they consider the recordings to be a controlled layering of specific sounds, each of which is under complete control from the moment the note is conceived through the final six. If the band gets pushed around in the process of making a record, so be it; as long as the \"project\" meets with the approval of the fellow in control.\n\nMy approach is exactly the opposite.\n\nI consider the band the most important thing, as the creative entity that spawned both the band's personality and style and as the social entity that exists 24 hours out of each day. I do not consider it my place to tell you what to do or how to play. I'm quite willing to let my opinions be heard (if I think the band is making beautiful progress or a heaving mistake, I consider it part of my job to tell them) but if the band decides to pursue something, I'll see that it gets done.\n\nI like to leave room for accidents or chaos. Making a seamless record, where every note and syllable is in place and every bass drum is identical, is no trick. Any idiot with the patience and the budget to allow such foolishness can do it. I prefer to work on records that aspire to greater things, like originality, personality and enthusiasm. If every element of the music and dynamics of a band is controlled by click tracks, computers, automated mixes, gates, samplers and sequencers, then the record may not be incompetent, but it certainly won't be exceptional. It will also bear very little relationship to the live band, which is what all this hooey is supposed to be about.\n\n#2: I do not consider recording and mixing to be unrelated tasks which can be performed by specialists with no continuous involvement. 99 percent of the sound of a record should be established while the basic take is recorded. Your experiences are specific to your records; but in my experience, remixing has never solved any problems that actually existed, only imaginary ones. I do not like remixing other engineer's recordings, and I do not like recording things for somebody else to remix. I have never been satisfied with either version of that methodology. Remixing is for talentless pussies who don't know how to tune a drum or point a microphone.\n\n#3: I do not have a fixed gospel of stock sounds and recording techniques that I apply blindly to every band in every situation. You are a different band from any other band and deserve at least the respect of having your own tastes and concerns addressed. For example, I love the sound of a boomy drum kit (say a Gretach or Camco) wide open in a big room, especially with a Bonhammy double-headed bass drum and a really painful snare drum. I also love the puke-inducing low end that comes off an old Fender Bassman or Ampeg guitar amp and the totally blown sound of an SVT with broken-in tubes. I also know that those sounds are inappropriate for some songs, and trying to force them is a waste of time. Predicating the recordings on my tastes is as stupid as designing a car around the upholstery. You guys need to decide and then articulate to me what you want to sound like so we don't come at the record from different directions.\n\n#4: Where we record the record is not as important as how it is recorded. If you have a studio you'd like to use, no hag. Otherwise, I can make suggestions. I have a nice 24-track studio in my house (Fugazi were just there, you can ask them how they rate it), and I'm familiar with most of the studios in the Midwest, the East coast and a dozen or so in the UK.\n\nI would be a little concerned about having you at my house for the duration of the whole recording and mixing process if only because you're celebrities, and I wouldn't want word getting out in the neighborhood and you guys having to put up with a lot of fan-style bullshit; it would be a fine place to mix the record though, and you can't beat the vitties.\n\nIf you want to leave the details of studio selection, lodgings, etc. up to me, I'm quite happy to sort all that stuff out. If you guys want to sort it out, just lay down the law.\n\nMy first choice for an outside recording studio would be a place called Pachyderm in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. It's a great facility with outstanding acoustics and a totally comfy architect's wet dream mansion where the band lives during the recordings. This makes everything more efficient. Since everybody is there, things get done and decisions get made a lot faster than if people are out and about in a city someplace. There's also all the posh shit like a sauna and swimming pool and fireplaces and trout stream and 50 acres and like that. I've made a bunch of records there and I've always enjoyed the place. It's also quite inexpensive, considering how great a facility it is.\n\nThe only bummer about Pachyderm is that the owners and manager are not technicians, and they don't have a tech on call. I've worked there enough that I can fix just about anything that can go wrong, short of a serious electronic collapse, but I've got a guy that I work with a lot (Bob Weston) who's real good with electronics (circuit design, trouble shooting and building shit on the spot), so if we choose to do it there, he'll probably come along in my payroll, since he'd be cheap insurance if a power supply blows up or a serious failure occurs in the dead of winter 50 miles from the closest tech. He's a recording engineer also, so he can be doing some of the more mundane stuff (cataloging tapes, packing stuff up, fetching supplies) while we're chopping away at the record proper.\n\nSome day I'm going to talk the Jesus Lizard into going up there and we'll have us a real time. Oh yeah, and it's the same Neve console the AC/DC album Back in Black was recorded and mixed on, so you know its just got to have the rock.\n\n#5: Dough. I explained this to Kurt but I thought I'd better reiterate it here. I do not want and will not take a royalty on any record I record. No points. Period. I think paying a royalty to a producer or engineer is ethically indefensible. The band write the songs. The band play the music. It's the band's fans who buy the records. The band is responsible for whether it's a great record or a horrible record. Royalties belong to the band.\n\nI would like to be paid like a plumber: I do the job and you pay me what it's worth. The record company will expect me to ask for a point or a point and a half. If we assume three million sales, that works out to 400,000 dollars or so. There's no fucking way I would ever take that much money. I wouldn't be able to sleep.\n\nI have to be comfortable with the amount of money you pay me, but it's your money, and I insist that you be comfortable with it as well. Kurt suggested paying me a chunk which I would consider full payment, and then if you really thought I deserved more, paying me another chunk after you'd had a chance to live with the album for a while. That would be fine, but probably more organizational trouble than it's worth.\n\nWhatever. I trust you guys to be fair to me and I know you must be familiar with what a regular industry goon would want. I will let you make the final decision about what I'm going to be paid. How much you choose to pay me will not affect my enthusiasm for the record.\n\nSome people in my position would expect an increase in business after being associated with your band. I, however, already have more work than I can handle, and frankly, the kind of people such superficialities will attract are not people I want to work with. Please don't consider that an issue.\n\nThat's it.\n\nPlease call me to go over any of this if it's unclear.\n\n(Signed)\n\nIf a record takes more than a week to make, somebody's fucking up.

He taught me so much about music, and life. Steve was a great friend - wise, kind and generous. I am so grateful,\" the singer wrote on social media after Albini's death at the age of 61. \"My thoughts are with him and his family and friends as we suffer his loss.\"\n\nA year after her 1992 debut album Dry, Harvey enlisted Albini for her sophomore LP after hearing his work with Pixies and Breeders. \"His sound just sounds like a band. He's the only person I know that can record a drum kit and it sounds like you're standing in front of a drum kit,\" Harvey told MTV's 120 Minutes at the time.\n\n\"It doesn't sound like it's gone through a recording process or it's coming out of speakers. You can feel the sound he records, and that is why I wanted to work with him, 'cause all I ever wanted is for us to be recorded and to sound like we do when we're playing together in a room, and that's never happened before.\" Harvey also credited Albini's innovative studio setup for \"capturing the feeling of the sound.\"\n\nRecorded in less than two weeks at Albini's then-go-to Pachyderm Studios, 1993's Rid of Me would ultimately be regarded as Harvey's masterpiece and land on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums list, where we noted \"the intense dynamic shifts in her music, which careen from blues to goth, often in the space of one song. Harvey was under the influence of Howlin' Wolf, Tom Waits, and Flannery O'Connor, and her singing, writing, and lead-guitar playing coalesce into something marked by flames. The lyrics have lots of licking, moaning, bleeding, stroking, open mouths, and dismembered body parts. The songs spew viscera as they build to a sticky ecstasy.\"\n\nFollowing Albini's death, many of the countless artists he worked with have penned tributes to the engineer, including Superchunk, Code Orange, and Failure, who recorded their debut album Comfort with Albini.\n\n\"In the weeks we spent with him making Comfort we were charmed, seduced, and challenged by his fantastic twisted sense of humor, astoundingly scientific mind, and principled sense of sonic fidelity and philosophical integrity,\" Failure wrote.\n\n\"Perhaps, at the time, we imagined he was the first of many brilliant experts we would encounter as our music career progressed -- but it soon became clear that the unique combination of talents that constituted Steve were of the once in a lifetime variety. He was also, in spite of -- or because of being so cool, a big nerd and a sweet guy.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_kreps@rollingstone.com", "name": "Daniel Kreps", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ_Harvey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PJ Harvey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drum kit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pixies (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noise rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LP_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LP record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachyderm_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pachyderm Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/120_Minutes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "120 Minutes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Orange_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Code Orange (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superchunk", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superchunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howlin'_Wolf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Howlin' Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gothic rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flannery_O'Connor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flannery O'Connor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Waits", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Waits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-111179174.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

His untimely passing left the music world in mourning. WWE Superstar CM Punk has been a big fan of Albini's work for quite some time now and has nothing but respect and admiration for the legend.\n\nPunk took to his Instagram stories soon after and shared a heartfelt tribute to the late star.

RIP.\"\n\nSteve Albini was the reason why CM Punk signed up to work on Girl On The Third Floor\n\nPunk starred in the 2019 horror movie Girl On The Third Floor. He later spoke with Paste Magazine and revealed that Steve Albini was the reason why he decided to work on the movie. Check out his comments below:\n\n\"That's one of the reasons I said yes to this. I knew if Albini was on board, it had to be quality. And basically I think they... 'Settled' is the wrong word, but they realized that I was available and I was a Chicago guy.

Neatly commenting on - and roundly mocking - the classic 'phallic' guitar hero image in one fell swoop.\n\nRanaldo has previously discussed the Sonic Sixteen in a video with Earthquaker Devices [above], in which he noted the key features, including the six-aside tuners (with a further four centrally positioned in the rear of the headstock).\n\nElsewhere, journalist and The Membranes bassist John Robb also paid tribute to wrote how working with Albini made him realize how far ahead of his time Albini was in terms of guitar recording and production.\n\n\"Back in 1986, he had only just started his recording career, and his house was his studio. He was using an early version of his ambient mic technique, which he used on the drum machine which was played back in the cellar, picking up the clattering room sound.\n\n\"Our guitars sounded weedy, so he took us to the local guitar shop to buy guitar pedals, which we had not used up to that time, being far too purest in our approach for such rockist equipment. I bought a Rat pedal, which I still use to this day...\n\n\"Steve was not a noise merchant. His recordings were meticulous and careful and measured just like he was. The sound was full of space and allowed to breathe, and those mics really picked up every nuance and shiver of the guitars.\"\n\nThe punk and alt-rock icon passed away yesterday at the age of 61.

In 2018, as his band Shellac headlined ArcTanGent festival, he spoke to former NME staffer Tom Connick about his recording process and advice for new bands.\n\nWith a credits list that reads like a who's who of musical icons, the reputation of legendary producer Steve Albini is like no other. The man behind the decks for such records as Nirvana's swansong 'In Utero' and Pixies' breakthrough 'Surfer Rosa', Albini is a godlike figure for many - his name is an instant stamp of approval.\n\nA kingpin of live, direct-to-tape recording, his legacy lives on through the increasingly digitised world, a spot in his studio the perfect way to capture the pure, live essence of recorded music. As frontman of alt-rock deconstructionists Shellac, too, he's driven guitar music forward for decades, pushing the boundaries of sound and structure, and inspiring generations of new acts to slash up the rulebook.\n\nAs Shellac topped the bill at left-field music lovers' dream festival ArcTanGent, we were granted an increasingly rare audience with the notoriously fame-shy icon, to talk all things production, recording, and the importance of practise, and how the best parts of records are actually made outside of the studio.\n\nGo analog, baby\n\n\"All of my experience is working within the analog domain, and I'd venture that no-one who's beginning recording now would do it in the analog domain. In the digital paradigm, especially people who are working semi-professionally, the process is often commingled - you write part of the song, then fuck around with it for a while, then come up with another part, and you stitch things together in the computer, and you create something over time, all of it spent simultaneously recording, writing, editing, processing, whatever. That's a methodology that I don't use.\"\n\nDon't rush into the studio\n\n\"All of my advice would pertain to preparation before you go into the recording. Do the majority of work on the record before you go into the studio, so when you're in the studio, you're working on a set of problems that you've preordained. Of course, things can get abstracted from there, and you can manipulate things to an extent, but the degree of abstraction is lower than in the digital paradigm.\n\n\"The pre-preparation for recording is the most important part of it. Our band, Shellac, takes that to a kind of stupid extent, whereby years will transpire between the first recording session and the second. We don't have the free time that most bands do, so in a year we can get in as many rehearsals as most bands can get in in a month. By the time we end up recording a song, it may be three or four years old. In the set tonight [at ArcTanGent], we'll be playing three songs that we've been working on for a couple of years that haven't been recorded.\"\n\n\"If you want to make a record in the classic tradition, you can write and arrange and rehearse the songs to the point where you can perform them, then you'd do an initial session where you just do that - you just play the songs. Then you take a rough mix of that home and live with it for a while, and learn what you can from it - see if there are things that you want to do over; see if there are things that you want to improve on; use that as the sort of homework for the next session. The next session would be where you do overdubs and final mixing and so on. That suggestion holds for whether it's a digital environment or an analog environment. If you break the [recording] session up into two chunks, and give yourself five or ten days in between, you have the same amount of time to work on your record. My advice would be: if you want to spend a longer period of time working on a record as a process, you want to minimise the amount of time that you're spending in the studio, and maximise the amount of time in the rehearsal room, or in conversation.\"\n\nMake your decisions early\n\n\"Once you're into the studio, you rapidly devolve into a series of options, where you have to debate whether this take is better than that take, or 'does is sound better with two of those, or one of those?', or 'should we take four bars out of the bridge?'. All of these decisions - if you're making those in the studio, that's the most expensive time to make them - that's the most taxing time to make them. You have so many decisions to make, you end up not being able to give full credit to any of those decisions. Whereas if you can spend some time away from the studio talking those things over, you can make sure that all the counties are heard from, makes sure that everyone makes their case - you can even experimentally try editorial stuff or adding things informally, and see if you're happy with the results. If you are, then you'll have confidence about those decisions when you go into the studio.\"\n\nDon't get caught up in 'the industry'\n\n\"I don't think we need to concern ourselves too much with the record business, just because the record business is such a trivial aspect in most bands' careers now. Most bands make their living performing live now, or occasionally lining their music up with other projects like doing film stuff, or sync stuff, or licensing their music for advertising. The record company aspect of the relationship is a pretty modest one, these days. The record companies do still try, occasionally, to illicit contractual obligations from bands, and I've long argued against the use of contracts in music - I think they're counterproductive. They tend to create an adversarial relationship, and they put bands on the defensive. I think they favour the party that has more money and resources, and so they're no protection for a band. I don't think contracts are useful.\"\n\nKeep it personal\n\n\"Contracts have no place in the personal relationships I've developed over the years. I don't advise people to use them - I've gotten along just fine for 30-plus years without being contractually bound to anybody, for anything. I feel like that's the most flexible, most cooperative way to do things. Let's say you have a relationship with a record label, and everybody gets along great at the start. If you have a contract that binds you to them, if they start treating you like an employee, or they start treating you poorly, you are still bound to them even though your relationship has changed. If you don't have a contract with them, then they're obliged to keep you happy, or else you leave. If you get along well, and things go well, and everybody's happy, then it will naturally continue. I feel like that's the most stable and most dependable kind of relationship - the one that's based on past success.\"\n\nDon't speak with finality\n\n\"For us, the recorded version is the recorded version, and the song exists outside of that recording. When we play live, songs that we've been playing for 25 years, a lot of them are quite different than when they were recorded. That's because, for us, the recording is an artefact of the existence of the music - it's not the definitive, final version.

Not only is he responsible for engineering a mini-canon of the last three decade's most important rock albums, but he was also one of the funniest curmudgeons ever.\n\nNobody could escape the wrath of Albini. Most famously, Albini raged against fellow Chicago natives The Smashing Pumpkins in an open letter, comparing them to REO Speedwagon and calling them \"stylistically appropriate for the current college party scene, but ultimately insignificant.\"\n\nHe opened his message by admitting, \"I'm not that familiar with Tool and don't know Maynard James Keenan.\" He is familiar enough to say \"Off the top of my head, the only things I know about Tool are that one stop-motion video, which is so bad it made me laugh out loud, and that their drummer was a soft-rock session guy who was also in Green Jello.\"\n\nIt's hard to tell which video Albini was referring to, as both \"Prison Sex\" and \"Sober\" prominently feature stop-motion animation (and are beloved, to boot). He then expanded to Maynard's business ventures, saying, \"Their singer has a winery, which is pretty funny all by itself.\"\n\nHe then took aim at the band's music itself, writing, \"What music of theirs I've heard has been categorically awful, though I can imagine music that sounds pretty much like that that I would like. When they emerged, they seemed like a band fabricated from constituent parts by the music industry to exploit an audience built by the underground/abstract metal scene.\"\n\nOuch.\n\nHowever, if you want to know similar music to Tool that Albini considered worthy, he ended his writing with some recommendations.\n\n\"I'd much rather listen to Helmet, the Jesus Lizard, Craw, Don Caballero, Stinking Lizaveta, Neurosis, Dazzling Killmen, Ruins or Zeni Geva, just to name a bunch of bands I've worked with that Tool fans might like, that are a lot better than Tool.\"\n\nIt's hard to argue that any of those bands aren't great. Whether or not you're a Tool die-hard or a fellow hater, Albini's take is genuinely hilarious, and speaks to his refusal to back down from his opinions.", "source": {"uri": "kfmx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FMX 94.5"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_hill@kfmx.com", "name": "John Hill", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Albini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tool (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smashing_Pumpkins", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Smashing Pumpkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressive metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REO_Speedwagon", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "REO Speedwagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_motion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stop motion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_Sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prison Sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Jell\u00ff", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Jell\u00ff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sober_(Tool_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sober (Tool song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maynard_James_Keenan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maynard James Keenan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drummer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Caballero", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Don Caballero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craw_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craw (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_Lizard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Jesus Lizard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neurosis (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heavy metal music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helmet (band)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Classifieds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/366/files/2024/05/attachment-steve_albini_tool_maynard_james_keenan.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550470", "eventUri": "eng-9550470", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 104, "relevance": 1}

He was 61.\n\nAlbini's death was unexpected as he was preparing to tour as the frontman for the band Shellac. Shellac's first album in a decade, To All Trains, is scheduled for release next week.\n\nWhen asked how his career would be regarded if he ever retired, Albini recently told The Guardian: \"I don't give a shit. I'm doing it, and that's what matters to me -- the fact that I get to keep doing it. That's the whole basis of it. I was doing it yesterday, and I'm gonna do it tomorrow, and I'm gonna carry on doing it.\"\n\nAlbini was also an advocate for the Covid vaccine.\n\nPitchfork noted: \"Albini was a legend of the recording studio, though he preferred the term 'engineer' to 'producer.' He recorded Nirvana's In Utero, Pixies' Surfer Rosa, PJ Harvey's Rid of Me, and countless more classic albums, and remained an outspoken critic of exploitative music industry practices.\"\n\nAlbini was a controversial figure as Pitchfork noted he was linked to provocative band names (Rapeman, Run N***er Run), song titles ( \"Pray I Don't Kill You F***ot,\" \"My Black Ass\"), and offhand statements (\"I want to strangle Odd Future\"). While he refused to apologize for his choice in names and jokes, in Michael Azerrad's 2001 book Our Band Could Be Your Life, Albini made it clear that he believed his real stances on race, gender, LGBTQ rights, and politics were obvious. \"I have less respect for the man who bullies his girlfriend and calls her 'Ms' than a guy who treats women reasonably and respectfully and calls them 'Yo! Bitch,'\" Albini told Azerrad. \"The point of all this is to change the way you live your life, not the way you speak.\"\n\nLater in life, Pitchfork noted, Albini repeatedly apologized for his past controversies, realizing that intent and moral clarity went only so far.\n\n\"A lot of things I said and did from an ignorant position of comfort and privilege are clearly awful and I regret them. It's nobody's obligation to overlook that, and I do feel an obligation to redeem myself,\" Albini wrote on X in 2021. \"If anything, we were trying to underscore the banality, the everyday nonchalance toward our common history with the atrocious, all while laboring under the tacit *mistaken* notion that things were getting better. I'm overdue for a conversation about my role in inspiring 'edgelord' shit.

England started their tournament opener brightly but had to dig deep to see off Serbia, leading to the performance to be pored over in great detail by fans and pundits alike.\n\nFoden's performance has come under the spotlight given he has yet to take his sparkling Manchester City displays onto the international scene, but he is expected to keep his place in the England side with Southgate, who is minded to stick with Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield too, set to name an unchanged team for their second group game against Denmark on Thursday.\n\nSouthgate praised Foden's key role ahead of the clash with Denmark in Frankfurt.\n\n\"I thought Phil did an incredible job for the team on Sunday,\" Southgate said.\n\n\"You know, sometimes the bits with the ball are obvious and they catch the eye, but the amount of ground he covered, the angles of pressing, the filling in for people who were further forward.\n\n\"I thought without Phil's contribution without the ball - and I know that's not the sexy bit and everybody wants to see him on the ball - I don't think we win the game.\n\n\"So then later in the game when we needed somebody to retain the ball and take the pressure, I thought he did that really well for us.\"\n\nAsked if he agreed there was another level to come for Foden, the England boss added: \"I think Phil has obviously set an incredibly high bar at Manchester City, where he knows exactly where every player is going to be every time he picks the ball up.\n\n\"A club that he's been at since he's been 13 years old.

Southgate has assured players only the judgement of the manager and staff is of importance.\n\nIn the build-up to the Group C match against Denmark in Frankfurt, Southgate highlighted the performance of Phil Foden after his display against Serbia was criticised.\n\n\"This is a different world to the one you experience at clubs,\" he said. \"The players as a collective recognise that now after the last couple of days. We talked with them about it. It's very rare at their club they'd win a game and experience what they've experienced over the last couple of days.\n\n\"I have to make sure I can guide them through that, let them understand it and recognise it's the reality of our world but that we shouldn't be thrown off track by it. We're in a good position, we know we want to play better, there are a lot of things we did really well and we move towards tomorrow's game.\n\nVice-captain Kyle Walker has played in the four tournaments under Southgate and understands the spotlight is on England when they are at a major finals.\n\n\"Normally there are 20 other Premier League teams to write about and fill columns about,\" he said. \"Now all eyes are on us boys over here representing our country and we are all coming together as one. So obviously there is going to be a massive scrutiny in certain performances or certain things we do but I think we cannot take away that we came away from there with three points on the board, a clean sheet and in a good stead for this game against Denmark.\n\n\"I concentrate on what's in this camp. What the manager says and what the people around me and team-mates are saying. With the scrutiny of coming away with a 1-0 victory against a well-drilled Serbia team, when we get that scrutiny we have to take it as a positive because people expect so much of us.\"\n\nSouthgate revealed he has imposed a social-media ban on himself during the tournament.\n\n\"When I was playing we read newspapers. Now, they are going to search for things. I don't do it, my world is a happier place if I shut myself off,\" said Southgate. \"It's not good from a global perspective because I've not got a clue what's going on with politics or events elsewhere. But for the next month that is going to be a better place for me. It helps me keep on track.\n\n\"Some of our players will take a similar approach, others will look at stuff. It doesn't stop people sending you a message saying 'ignore the nonsense' or whatever that might be. Then you know it's kicking off. But you sense that from the line of questioning anyway.\"\n\nComment: Southgate assumes role of psychologist to try to harness negative energy\n\nIt was a surprise when Gareth Southgate began a meeting of the England squad on Tuesday evening with a specific subject. But it has been coming.\n\nThe England manager wanted to explain to the players why they can win a game - as they did in defeating Serbia 1-0 in their opening group game in the European Championship - and still come in for criticism.\n\nOf course it happens at their clubs. But not, it is felt, with this level of scrutiny. And not when they are victorious.\n\nAnd it is interesting that Southgate deemed it necessary to say something. But while this is a squad with great experience it also contains 12 players at their first senior tournament.\n\nDespite their Premier League experience some appear to have been taken aback by the criticism.\n\nNo one is more qualified to discuss this than Southgate who is into his eighth tournament - four as a player and now four as a manager - and can bring some unique insight.\n\nNot just that, but Southgate is also a former pundit for ITV, and a former co-commentator, covering three major tournaments as well as big FA Cup and Champions League games most weeks. He left only in 2013 to become England Under-21 manager.\n\nSo that gives the 53-year-old's 11 tournaments in all, including the last time one was held in Germany, the 2006 World Cup and the England circus at Baden-Baden. He spoke from experience when he talked about how there is always a \"narrative\" about the performances of \"a couple of players\" after every game.\n\n\"The players as a collective recognise that now after the last couple of days,\" Southgate said. \"We talked to them about it.\"\n\nWhat is interesting is that Southgate took this explanatory role. It means he has, in effect, become something of a sports psychologist as well as a manager.\n\nIn the past, the Football Association has employed figures such as Dr Pippa Grange, the head of people and team development, who was built up as such a vital figure at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.\n\nHer role was undoubtedly inflated and less important than portrayed, not least in the hugely successful drama Dear England, which is returning to the National Theatre.\n\n'Criticism has clearly hurt'\n\nBut the meat of the play, Southgate's inspirational leadership of England, and the mental and psychological barriers the players have faced, and lifting the weight of the Three Lions shirt, is true.\n\nThe FA still has a support staff of sports psychologists but no one is specifically attached to the England team and, to a degree, it therefore appears to be a task that is being undertaken by Southgate. Not least in dealing with some of the concerns - and anger - over the way the team is portrayed.\n\nCriticism has clearly hurt. Southgate does not ban his players from being on social media. He reasons they are adults and need to be treated as such. But he does highlight the importance of trying to avoid it and talks to them about it. He wants the players to have a clear head but knows that may be unrealistic.\n\nIt is true that some players still scroll through their phones after games and - evidently - some have been stung by what was said and written following the Serbia match.\n\nThe general feeling within the camp? England got the job done and won and should be judged when the other two group games, starting with Denmark here in Frankfurt on Thursday and then Slovenia next week, are played.\n\nSouthgate's job is to temper players' anger and harness it\n\nThere is a touch of naivety to that and also a contradiction. England want the attention and that invites opinion. We should never stifle that. But, to give it context, if England beat Denmark they will have won their first two games at a Euros for the first time ever.\n\nSeveral players have chosen to come off social media for the tournament. Southgate said he does not watch or read any comment or analysis on England. This has included Erik ten Hag's withering put down of him on Dutch TV as being an essentially conservative coach. But there is probably an agenda there given the Manchester United manager knows Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe like Southgate.\n\nHowever, in the same breath Southgate also said: \"You become aware of these things because they get sent to you.\"\n\nThere have been some strong takes on the contributions made by Phil Foden, Trent Alexander-Arnold and even captain Harry Kane against Serbia which has caused bewilderment in the camp and it is part of Southgate's job to try to temper that while also harnessing it.\n\nThe the last thing the manager wants is friction. But he will want to focus some of that \"them and us\" energy.\n\nEnergy is important, also. A major worry has been the fitness of the squad after a gruelling season. Southgate has said how challenging it is. Crucially, according to sports scientists, that is in the head more than in the body. Although it is not for nothing that England chose a hotel with a wonderful spa as their team base. Rest and relaxation are the key but if the players are mentally fatigued then criticism becomes potentially more damaging.\n\nWhat is intriguing in all of this is how it has turned almost full circle. Southgate has raised expectation and accepts it is not unreasonable for him to be judged on whether England win these Euros, even if they have only ever won one trophy in their entire football history and never overseas. Football is about winning.\n\nThere is also the danger for England of where this is heading. Part of the previous complaint about England was players being inhibited because they feared the headlines - as Wayne Rooney admitted after the Iceland debacle at the Euros in 2016. Ultimately it is for them to deal with while we should welcome them voicing their opinions and countering. Southgate the psychologist is attempting to do that.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_mcgrath@telegraph.co.uk", "name":

Southgate does not subscribe to the view that the Manchester City attacker is struggling to produce his outstanding club form for England.\n\n\"I thought Phil did an exceptional job for us on Sunday,\" Southgate said. \"Other players grabbed the attention, but the way he worked for the team, defended the spaces, real intelligence in how he played. Towards the end of the game, he retained the ball for us in really crucial moments. We were happy with what Phil did.\n\n\"There's going to be a narrative - a player, a couple of players - after every England game. This is a dif\u00adferent world to the one you \u00adexperience at clubs. The players recognise that now after the last couple of days.\n\n\"We talked with them about it. It's very rare at their club they'd win a game and experience what they've experienced over the last couple of days.\n\n\"I have to make sure I can guide them through that, let them understand it and recognise it's the reality of our world but that we shouldn't be thrown off track by it. We're in a good position.\"\n\nOne of the most notable comments about England's approach against Serbia came from Erik ten Hag, who was working as a pundit on Dutch television. The Manchester United manager suggested that Southgate's vision is to sit back after going 1-0 up. Southgate responded by noting that bringing on Jarrod Bowen, Conor Gallagher and Kobbie Mainoo helped England to restore control during the second half.\n\n\"During the course of a tournament there's obviously millions of opinions in different directions and so whilst I'm not reading a thing, or listening to a thing, you become aware of these things because they get sent to you,\" he said.\n\n\"There was a moment where we weren't in as much control of the game on Sunday as we would have liked. I think there are moments where you're in control and you can push forward, moments where you've got a dif\u00adferent problem to solve. Every coach would reflect on that. I was really pleased with Gallagher, Kobbie and Bowen.\"\n\nSouthgate acknowledged that \u00adEngland did not keep the ball well enough against Serbia but he was positive about Trent Alexander-Arnold's performance in midfield. The Liverpool defender is likely to be given another opportunity in that role.\n\nSouthgate had hoped that Shaw, who has not played since \u00adFebruary, would be on the bench against Denmark. But the left back was not involved in team training on Wednesday and Ten Hag has predicted that Shaw will not be ready before the end of the group stage.\n\n\"Luke is progressing as we thought he would,\" Southgate said. \"There was a moment last week where we thought he could be a couple of days ahead of schedule but more realistically we are looking to the back end of this week and early next, and we are not unhappy with that progress at all, and we are still positive he can make a contribution as we move forward.\"\n\nSouthgate added Denmark would be out for revenge after a contentious penalty led to their semi\u2011final defeat against England at Euro 2020. \"We are very clear on the messaging we give to the players and what the mindset of an opponent might be,\" he said.\n\n\"It's an important part of psychologically preparing our team.\" - Guardian", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southgate,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrod_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jarrod Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/guzkJ-YiTDvglM8sSv3LdknBZag=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/GGKMF33BXX5XBYRQJNB4MYU5SE.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658686", "eventUri": "eng-9658686", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Southgate has assured players only the judgement of the manager and staff is of importance.\n\nIn the build-up to the Group C match against Denmark in Frankfurt, Southgate highlighted the performance of Phil Foden after his display against Serbia was criticised.\n\n\"This is a different world to the one you experience at clubs,\" he said. \"The players as a collective recognise that now after the last couple of days. We talked with them about it. It's very rare at their club they'd win a game and experience what they've experienced over the last couple of days.\n\n\"I have to make sure I can guide them through that, let them understand it and recognise it's the reality of our world but that we shouldn't be thrown off track by it. We're in a good position, we know we want to play better, there are a lot of things we did really well and we move towards tomorrow's game.\n\nVice-captain Kyle Walker has played in the four tournaments under Southgate and understands the spotlight is on England when they are at a major finals.\n\n\"Normally there are 20 other Premier League teams to write about and fill columns about,\" he said. \"Now all eyes are on us boys over here representing our country and we are all coming together as one. So obviously there is going to be a massive scrutiny in certain performances or certain things we do but I think we cannot take away that we came away from there with three points on the board, a clean sheet and in a good stead for this game against Denmark.\n\n\"I concentrate on what's in this camp. What the manager says and what the people around me and team-mates are saying. With the scrutiny of coming away with a 1-0 victory against a well-drilled Serbia team, when we get that scrutiny we have to take it as a positive because people expect so much of us.\"\n\nSouthgate revealed he has imposed a social-media ban on himself during the tournament.\n\n\"When I was playing we read newspapers. Now, they are going to search for things. I don't do it, my world is a happier place if I shut myself off,\" said Southgate. \"It's not good from a global perspective because I've not got a clue what's going on with politics or events elsewhere. But for the next month that is going to be a better place for me. It helps me keep on track.\n\n\"Some of our players will take a similar approach, others will look at stuff. It doesn't stop people sending you a message saying 'ignore the nonsense' or whatever that might be. Then you know it's kicking off. But you sense that from the line of questioning anyway.\"\n\nIt was a surprise when Gareth Southgate began a meeting of the England squad on Tuesday evening with a specific subject. But it has been coming.\n\nThe England manager wanted to explain to the players why they can win a game - as they did in defeating Serbia 1-0 in their opening group game in the European Championship - and still come in for criticism.\n\nOf course it happens at their clubs. But not, it is felt, with this level of scrutiny. And not when they are victorious.\n\nAnd it is interesting that Southgate deemed it necessary to say something. But while this is a squad with great experience it also contains 12 players at their first senior tournament.\n\nDespite their Premier League experience some appear to have been taken aback by the criticism.\n\nNo one is more qualified to discuss this than Southgate who is into his eighth tournament - four as a player and now four as a manager - and can bring some unique insight.\n\nNot just that, but Southgate is also a former pundit for ITV, and a former co-commentator, covering three major tournaments as well as big FA Cup and Champions League games most weeks. He left only in 2013 to become England Under-21 manager.\n\nSo that gives the 53-year-old's 11 tournaments in all, including the last time one was held in Germany, the 2006 World Cup and the England circus at Baden-Baden. He spoke from experience when he talked about how there is always a \"narrative\" about the performances of \"a couple of players\" after every game.\n\n\"The players as a collective recognise that now after the last couple of days,\" Southgate said. \"We talked to them about it.\"\n\nWhat is interesting is that Southgate took this explanatory role. It means he has, in effect, become something of a sports psychologist as well as a manager.\n\nIn the past, the Football Association has employed figures such as Dr Pippa Grange, the head of people and team development, who was built up as such a vital figure at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.\n\nHer role was undoubtedly inflated and less important than portrayed, not least in the hugely successful drama Dear England, which is returning to the National Theatre.\n\nBut the meat of the play, Southgate's inspirational leadership of England, and the mental and psychological barriers the players have faced, and lifting the weight of the Three Lions shirt, is true.\n\nThe FA still has a support staff of sports psychologists but no one is specifically attached to the England team and, to a degree, it therefore appears to be a task that is being undertaken by Southgate. Not least in dealing with some of the concerns - and anger - over the way the team is portrayed.\n\nCriticism has clearly hurt. Southgate does not ban his players from being on social media. He reasons they are adults and need to be treated as such. But he does highlight the importance of trying to avoid it and talks to them about it. He wants the players to have a clear head but knows that may be unrealistic.\n\nIt is true that some players still scroll through their phones after games and - evidently - some have been stung by what was said and written following the Serbia match.\n\nThe general feeling within the camp? England got the job done and won and should be judged when the other two group games, starting with Denmark here in Frankfurt on Thursday and then Slovenia next week, are played.\n\nThere is a touch of naivety to that and also a contradiction. England want the attention and that invites opinion. We should never stifle that. But, to give it context, if England beat Denmark they will have won their first two games at a Euros for the first time ever.\n\nSeveral players have chosen to come off social media for the tournament. Southgate said he does not watch or read any comment or analysis on England. This has included Erik ten Hag's withering put down of him on Dutch TV as being an essentially conservative coach. But there is probably an agenda there given the Manchester United manager knows Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe like Southgate.\n\nHowever, in the same breath Southgate also said: \"You become aware of these things because they get sent to you.\"\n\nThere have been some strong takes on the contributions made by Phil Foden, Trent Alexander-Arnold and even captain Harry Kane against Serbia which has caused bewilderment in the camp and it is part of Southgate's job to try to temper that while also harnessing it.\n\nThe the last thing the manager wants is friction. But he will want to focus some of that \"them and us\" energy.\n\nEnergy is important, also. A major worry has been the fitness of the squad after a gruelling season. Southgate has said how challenging it is. Crucially, according to sports scientists, that is in the head more than in the body. Although it is not for nothing that England chose a hotel with a wonderful spa as their team base. Rest and relaxation are the key but if the players are mentally fatigued then criticism becomes potentially more damaging.\n\nWhat is intriguing in all of this is how it has turned almost full circle. Southgate has raised expectation and accepts it is not unreasonable for him to be judged on whether England win these Euros, even if they have only ever won one trophy in their entire football history and never overseas. Football is about winning.\n\nThere is also the danger for England of where this is heading. Part of the previous complaint about England was players being inhibited because they feared the headlines - as Wayne Rooney admitted after the Iceland debacle at the Euros in 2016. Ultimately it is for them to deal with while we should welcome them voicing their opinions and countering. Southgate the psychologist is attempting to do that.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Southgate does not subscribe to the view that the Manchester City attacker is struggling to produce his outstanding club form for England.\n\n\"I thought Phil did an exceptional job for us on Sunday,\" Southgate said. \"Other players grabbed the attention, but the way he worked for the team, defended the spaces, real intelligence in how he played. Towards the end of the game, he retained the ball for us in really crucial moments. We were happy with what Phil did.\n\n\"There's going to be a narrative - a player, a couple of players - after every England game. This is a dif\u00adferent world to the one you \u00adexperience at clubs. The players recognise that now after the last couple of days.\n\n\"We talked with them about it. It's very rare at their club they'd win a game and experience what they've experienced over the last couple of days.\n\nI have to make sure I can guide them through that, let them understand it and recognise it's the reality of our world but that we shouldn't be thrown off track by it. We're in a good position.\"\n\nOne of the most notable comments about England's approach against Serbia came from Erik ten Hag, who was working as a pundit on Dutch television. The Manchester United manager suggested that Southgate's vision is to sit back after going 1-0 up. Southgate responded by noting that bringing on Jarrod Bowen, Conor Gallagher and Kobbie Mainoo helped England to restore control during the second half.\n\n\"During the course of a tournament there's obviously millions of opinions in different directions and so whilst I'm not reading a thing, or listening to a thing, you become aware of these things because they get sent to you,\" he said.\n\n\"There was a moment where we weren't in as much control of the game on Sunday as we would have liked. I think there are moments where you're in control and you can push forward, moments where you've got a dif\u00adferent problem to solve. Every coach would reflect on that. I was really pleased with Gallagher, Kobbie and Bowen.\"\n\nSouthgate acknowledged that \u00adEngland did not keep the ball well enough against Serbia but he was positive about Trent Alexander-Arnold's performance in midfield. The Liverpool defender is likely to be given another opportunity in that role.\n\nSouthgate had hoped that Shaw, who has not played since \u00adFebruary, would be on the bench against \u00adDenmark. But the left-back was not involved in team training on Wednesday and Ten Hag has predicted that Shaw will not be ready before the end of the group stage.\n\n\"Luke is progressing as we thought he would,\" Southgate said. \"There was a moment last week where we thought he could be a couple of days ahead of schedule but more realistically we are looking to the back end of this week and early next, and we are not unhappy with that progress at all, and we are still positive he can make a contribution as we move forward.\"\n\nSouthgate added Denmark would be out for revenge after a contentious penalty led to their semi\u2011final defeat against England at Euro 2020. \"We are very clear on the messaging we give to the players and what the mindset of an opponent might be,\" he said.\n\n\"It's an important part of psychologically preparing our team.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

When I was playing, we read newspapers. I don't do it.\n\n\"My world is a happier place if I shut myself off.

Southgate does not subscribe to the view that the Manchester City attacker is struggling to produce his outstanding club form for England.\n\n\"I thought Phil did an exceptional job for us on Sunday,\" Southgate said. \"Other players grabbed the attention, but the way he worked for the team, defended the spaces, real intelligence in how he played. Towards the end of the game, he retained the ball for us in really crucial moments. We were happy with what Phil did.\n\n\"There's going to be a narrative - a player, a couple of players - after every England game. This is a dif\u00adferent world to the one you \u00adexperience at clubs. The players recognise that now after the last couple of days.\n\n\"We talked with them about it. It's very rare at their club they'd win a game and experience what they've experienced over the last couple of days.\n\nI have to make sure I can guide them through that, let them understand it and recognise it's the reality of our world but that we shouldn't be thrown off track by it. We're in a good position.\"\n\nOne of the most notable comments about England's approach against Serbia came from Erik ten Hag, who was working as a pundit on Dutch television. The Manchester United manager suggested that Southgate's vision is to sit back after going 1-0 up. Southgate responded by noting that bringing on Jarrod Bowen, Conor Gallagher and Kobbie Mainoo helped England to restore control during the second half.\n\n\"During the course of a tournament there's obviously millions of opinions in different directions and so whilst I'm not reading a thing, or listening to a thing, you become aware of these things because they get sent to you,\" he said.\n\n\"There was a moment where we weren't in as much control of the game on Sunday as we would have liked. I think there are moments where you're in control and you can push forward, moments where you've got a dif\u00adferent problem to solve. Every coach would reflect on that. I was really pleased with Gallagher, Kobbie and Bowen.\"\n\nRelated: Unimpressed by England's start in Germany? At least it's not Euro 88\n\nSouthgate acknowledged that \u00adEngland did not keep the ball well enough against Serbia but he was positive about Trent Alexander-Arnold's performance in midfield. The Liverpool defender is likely to be given another opportunity in that role.\n\nSouthgate had hoped that Shaw, who has not played since \u00adFebruary, would be on the bench against \u00adDenmark. But the left-back was not involved in team training on Wednesday and Ten Hag has predicted that Shaw will not be ready before the end of the group stage.\n\n\"Luke is progressing as we thought he would,\" Southgate said. \"There was a moment last week where we thought he could be a couple of days ahead of schedule but more realistically we are looking to the back end of this week and early next, and we are not unhappy with that progress at all, and we are still positive he can make a contribution as we move forward.\"\n\nSouthgate added Denmark would be out for revenge after a contentious penalty led to their semi\u2011final defeat against England at Euro 2020. \"We are very clear on the messaging we give to the players and what the mindset of an opponent might be,\" he said.\n\n\"It's an important part of psychologically preparing our team.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrod_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jarrod Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/0664a9e4b506ff2e4e0bb2d8bd6a5980", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658686", "eventUri": "eng-9658686", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Maybe the biggest thing is we have to accept the environment that we're in and the expectation around this.\n\n\"We are going to have to walk towards that challenge. At the moment we're falling a bit short of that. Ultimately that's my responsibility. I'm the manager and I've got to guide this group in the best way possible. To achieve extraordinary things, you have to go through some difficult moments.\"\n\nSouthgate, who called the performance anxious and criticised the poor passing that led to Morten Hjulmand's equaliser, was asked about England's fans jeering near the end of the game and at full-time.\n\n\"We're in the environment of winning on the biggest possible stage and if I don't hit the level that's needed, then we have to accept what comes our way,\" he said. \"We have to find the best way to solve that. Of course we need the fans. But I have to say they've been brilliant. What I would say is these boys are not lacking effort at the moment. It's not a case that they're not trying. If anything at the moment we care too much.\"\n\nAfter the game, Prince William went into the England dressing room to speak to the players.\n\nEngland have taken a lot of inexperienced players to Germany and it was put to Southgate that some are struggling to deal with the pressure of international football. \"We're in an environment where we have to deliver,\" he said. \"We have to walk towards that challenge. I intend to walk towards it, whatever the reaction is. I'm not going to avoid going over to the fans at the end of the game. We confront it head on.\"\n\nSouthgate admitted that England lack balance with the right-footed Kieran Trippier deputising for Luke Shaw at left-back. He said that he has not found a replacement in midfield for Kalvin Phillips, although he defended Trent Alexander-Arnold's performance. Alexander-Arnold, who started again in the middle, was the first England player to be substituted.\n\n\"One of our biggest problems was we weren't pressing well enough as a team so he had a lot of problems to solve and most of those he did really well,\" Southgate said. \"We are looking at a team performance and the team didn't function today and that is my responsibility.\"\n\nIt had been hoped that England's defeat to Iceland in their final warm-up match would serve as a wake-up call. Southgate, who refused to blame the state of the pitch for the stodginess, faces a huge task to make his players believe that they can become European champions for the first time.\n\n\"The challenge is to do something that has never been done before so it couldn't be any bigger,\" he said. \"We know we have had a lot of issues but we are where we are now and we have to find the best way forward.\"\n\nSouthgate was pressed on whether Kane is fit after returning from a back injury. The captain was taken off when England were chasing a goal in the second half. \"He has only had one 90 minutes in the last five or six weeks and it took a lot out of him,\" Southgate said.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southgate,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morten Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalvin_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kalvin Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/War_and_Politics", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/War and Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Drills_and_Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Drills and Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/86b8458cfb542d7bb0287bced983fa5c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658686", "eventUri": "eng-9658686", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nOnce Gareth Southgate felt his England team understood his instructions for Thursday's match against Denmark, he then attempted to ensure they also knew what the game meant. The staff went through a session on the mindset of the opposition and \"what motivations they might have\". That is something Southgate now insists on for every game, as \"it's an important part of psychologically preparing our team\" for the \"narrative\" of any occasion, but it is more distinctive for this one. Denmark are fired up. Their squad are constantly talking about the penalty that was given for England's 2-1 victory in the Euro 2020 semi-final at Wembley, and want to right that \"injustice\".\n\nThe scorer Harry Kane is of course still there, but the player who was criticised for apparently diving isn't. Raheem Sterling is one of three of England's front six from that game who won't be playing in Frankfurt, as Southgate attempts to get a new chemistry to blend. It still seemed elusive, on the evidence of the 1-0 win over Serbia. The manager said his staff \"have challenged everybody to take that next step\" in terms of performance in this game.\n\nIt unintentionally echoes the words of Cesc Fabregas on a player who is almost Sterling's direct replacement in the starting XI. Phil Foden has become the focus of much of the debate after a fairly dour opening team performance. That is because he didn't stand out in the way he has for Manchester City, where he won the Football Writers' Player of the Year accolade last season. Fabregas said Foden needed \"to take this responsibility to grow\", to \"step up\".\n\nWhile Southgate has received criticism for not putting the playmaker where he can excel, there is a growing feeling within the game that the player is now overly accustomed to the highly defined structure of Pep Guardiola's City. It is almost the contradiction of a star who looks so free and fluid in his actual play. Foden has been cast as a street footballer but he is actually the ultimate product of the modern academy system, having been at City since he was a child.\n\nSouthgate isn't going to be able to replicate that kind of structure with England, especially not within a week, so there have been arguments that Foden may have to be sacrificed. The idea of building the attack around him has vanished in the wake of Jude Bellingham's rise, to the point that Foden felt he had to stress how they could play together.\n\nSouthgate, however, just isn't heeding those calls. Foden is virtually certain to start against Denmark, with the team expected to be much the same as against Serbia, other than perhaps Conor Gallagher coming into central midfield for Trent Alexander-Arnold due to his energy.\n\nSouthgate even went out of his way to praise the role that Foden did play.\n\n\"The first thing to say would be that I thought Phil did an exceptional job for us on Sunday. Other players grabbed the attention, but the way he worked for the team, defended the spaces, real intelligence in how he played. Towards the end of the game, he retained the ball for us in really crucial moments.\n\n\"There was a lot going on in the game, a lot tactically to solve. And we were happy with what Phil did.\"\n\nSouthgate even addressed some of the wider debate around Foden, and whether he is a player who needs to be \"unlocked\". It was the subject of another meeting before the game. The staff wanted to help a relatively young squad deal with the level of scrutiny they get even after a win. Debates that rise like that around Foden are part of it.\n\n\"There's going to be a narrative around a player, a couple of players, after every England game. This is a different world to the one you experience at clubs. The players as a collective recognise that now after the last couple of days. We talked with them about it. It's very rare at their club they'd win a game and experience what they've experienced over the last couple of days.\n\n\"I have to make sure I can guide them through that, let them understand it and recognise it's the reality of our world but that we shouldn't be thrown off track by it. We're in a good position, we know we want to play better.\"\n\nKyle Walker meanwhile defended his City teammate.\n\n\"I don't think one game defines a player. It's a season or a tournament that defines a player. Especially with Phil coming off the back of the season he had, I don't think one 90 minutes should be scrutinised as much as I'm being told it is ... Phil is a great character, he's had...I wouldn't say a difficult path to get here as he's won a lot of trophies at Manchester City, but he's had to be patient. This is just another little thing he has to overcome when there is so much pressure on him now after such a great season, that big players have to rise up in big occasions.\"\n\nIt is hard to disagree. Foden and Bellingham will develop a better understanding the more they play together. The absence of Luke Shaw, however, does mean it might remain staccato for some time.\n\nThe Manchester United full-back has become one of England's most important players, as the only left-footed defender in the squad. Without him, there's an imbalance in the team that constantly requires compensating. It is a direct reason why the formation can sometimes look ill-fitting.\n\nSouthgate said that England are unlikely to see Shaw until the end of next week, which would mean the knockout stages. The left-back is still on an individual training programme, separate from the rest of the squad.\n\nWhat that knockout stage looks like will be dependent on Thursday's game in Frankfurt, of course. The 24-team nature of this tournament can mean these games are strange since they lack the same tension. One victory is almost certain to put a team through to the next round as (at least) one of the best third-placed sides. England have that victory, after their 1-0 over Serbia. Denmark don't, after a tough 1-1 draw against Slovenia.\n\nTheir need is greater, as is their emotional edge given how that Euro 2020 semi-final went. England still want to make sure they top the group, though, which victory would all but confirm. Denmark's highly technical midfield will also offer a valuable test, especially with Christian Eriksen on his own emotional high after offering one of the stories of the tournament. Having suffered cardiac arrest in his last European Championship match, against Iceland in 2021, he then scored against Slovenia.\n\n\"It was almost written - but it is only written if you have the mentality and the desire to get back and play, and play at the level he has,\" Southgate said.\n\nThis is the level England's midfield has to rise to. It is why Gallagher may come in for Alexander-Arnold, as Southgate hinted in the way he spoke about the Serbia win.\n\n\"There was a moment where we weren't in as much control of the game on Sunday as we would've liked, and we felt that was a good moment for Conor Gallagher to come into the game. He did the job.\"\n\nSouthgate also made a point about his subs in that game.\n\n\"Within 30 seconds [Jarrod] Bowen produced a cross that, on another day, makes it 2-0 and there's a different narrative around the whole performance.\"\n\nEngland can rectify that on Thursday. Denmark want to rectify something else.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They are going to search for things. When I was playing, we read newspapers.\n\n\"I don't do it. My world is a happier place if I shut myself off. It is not good from a global perspective because I haven't got a clue what's going on in politics or events elsewhere. But for the next month that is going to be a better place for me. So that helps me really keep on track.\n\n\"I think some of our players take a similar approach, others will definitely look at stuff. Of course, it doesn't stop people sending you a message 'saying ignore the nonsense' or whatever it might be. So you go 'Oh, OK, it's kicking off, usual thing.'\n\n\"You know that from the line of questioning anyway really. Look, it is what it is. There's more noise around a national team than there ever is around a club team. Millions of people in your own country, extensive media coverage, social media, one guy writing a comment on social media gets put in a newspaper now, that's a story. So it's a different world.\n\n\"Personally I accept that's how it is. It is not going to affect what I do. My job is to keep the players on track. What are the realities? What are we doing well? What do we need to be better at? Where actually are we?\n\n\"Because you can drift and you can see them, a lot of them who haven't been with England, say 'Right, OK, we've won our first game and this is how it is.' That's a strange experience for some of the boys who haven't been with us.\n\n\"It's great that we have experienced players that have lived through it who can say 'no, no, no, this is what's important, this is how we stay on track.' Our assessment of the game is the most important.\n\n\"We are never slow to pull things up that aren't right, that aren't good enough. That's the most important view -- the way we dissect the game and, of course, we have all the information around what's going on as well.\"\n\nEngland have won all four of their opening matches at a tournament under Southgate, but they had never won their first game at a European Championships prior to his appointment in 2016 and are aiming to win their opening two games at a Euros for the first time ever.\n\nAsked if England's chequered history was often forgotten, Southgate replied: \"I've been in this environment for eight years so I understand it all, it used to annoy me. Now I'm ambivalent to it.\n\n\"Winning matches in tournaments is incredibly hard. This tournament, you've now got the extra dimension of incredible support for all the teams in the stadiums. That's a little bit different to the last two tournaments we've been in.\n\n\"Look, we've had some great results over the years, so maybe even we take wins for granted which we shouldn't.

Play on Apple Spotify\n\nSouthgate would baulk, no doubt, at the idea the Denmark game is a free hit because he knows how much criticism will come if England do not win, but the reality is a draw would most likely ensure his players qualify for the knockout stage with a game to spare. And then there will be no more free hits.\n\nThe result matters but what matters more is that it is a chance to breathe confidence back into Foden's attacking play, and as far as the experiment of playing Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield is concerned, this is the final audition.\n\nRead MoreEXCLUSIVE Why Denmark are motivated by an incident no England fan even remembers: PETER SCHMEICHEL interview\n\nAlexander-Arnold, one of the best passers of the ball in English football, played well in the first half against Serbia without playing well enough to convince those who say it is madness for him to be learning the position during a tournament.\n\nHe is so lavishly talented and so adept at producing crosses and passes that can unlock even the lowest of low blocks that Southgate wants to persist with playing him alongside Declan Rice, the kind of bold move so many of his critics said he was incapable of. Now, apparently, he is being too bold.\n\nAlexander-Arnold will come up against one of football's classiest midfield schemers in Frankfurt in Christian Eriksen and even though Southgate expects the Manchester United player to be in a more advanced role, watching him pull the strings for any side is always an education.\n\nEngland's former left back Stuart Pearce on Wednesday said he believed Alexander-Arnold could exert the same kind of influence Glenn Hoddle once wielded for England and Southgate was asked if he saw the Liverpool player as a quarter-back passer or a metronome like Frenkie de Jong of the Netherlands, setting the tempo of the play.\n\n'I think he's less likely to be a player who dictates tempo,' the England manager said. 'That's a different type and probably that's midfield players who have been in there for ever and really understand the flow of a game.\n\n'What I do see is that range of passing and that ability to open up a defence that might be blocking spaces, defending low. He's somebody that's going to cause opposition players to be aware that we can play balls in behind them at any point with fantastic accuracy.\n\nCalls for Southgate to replace Alexander-Arnold and Foden must be resisted, at least for now\n\nHowever, he will have to contemplate plan B if Alexander-Arnold and Foden do not thrive\n\nThere have been calls for Cole Palmer (L) or Anthony Gordon (R) to replace Foden\n\n'His understanding of the game is good. All the defensive responsibilities we've asked of him, it's not necessarily been where he's played for many years but he's been really diligent and open to wanting to take that on board. So, look, we know it's a work in progress.\n\n'We know it's something that's going to get a lot of attention as it's not been the norm but we feel it's something that can add to what we've got.'\n\nRead More Jude Bellingham plays like he's unbeatable but others must step up, writes OLIVER HOLT\n\nIt is hard to argue with Southgate about that. To win this European Championship, to get past sides with the quality of France, Germany, Portugal and Spain, Southgate knows playing safe is not going to be enough.\n\nEngland have suffered defeats by fine, fine margins in the last three major tournaments and a player such as Alexander-Arnold, if he settles into the role that has been mapped out for him, can tilt the balance the other way -- in England's direction.\n\nThe same applies to Foden. Sunday was Bellingham's night. The Real Madrid player played, not for the first time, like a superhuman, and sometimes there is only room for one performance like that in a side. The rest slip into a supportive role. Maybe against Denmark, the roles will be reversed and Foden will take centre stage.\n\nFine, beguiling, brilliant players though they both are, and even though tournament football accelerates a team's evolution, calls for Southgate to replace Foden with Cole Palmer or Anthony Gordon at this stage have to be resisted.\n\n'There's going to be a narrative around a player, a couple of players, after every England game,' said Southgate, referring to the conversation about Foden.\n\n'This is a different world to the one you experience at clubs. The players, as a collective, recognise that after the last couple of days. We talked with them about it. It's very rare at their club that they would win a game and experience what they have experienced over the last couple of days.\n\nSouthgate called for his England stars to ignore criticism after their tepid triumph over Serbia\n\nSunday was Jude Bellingham's night, but perhaps the roles will be reversed against Denmark\n\n'I have to make sure I can guide them through that, let them understand it and recognise it's the reality of our world but that we shouldn't be thrown off track by it. We're in a good position, we know we want to play better, there are lot of things we did really well and we move towards tomorrow's game.'\n\nAlexander-Arnold and Foden will get another chance against the Danes, as they should. If they excel, England will move on to Tuesday's game against Slovenia with increased confidence.\n\nIf they do not, Southgate will have to contemplate Plan B. And if that happens, time will no longer be his friend.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I hope they have a little bit longer than that. There should be more joy in it, but that's not my reality.\"\n\nHe added: \"It is what it is. There is more noise around a national team than there ever is around a club team. Millions of people in your own country, extensive media coverage, social media. It's a different world.\n\n\"It is not going to affect what I do. My job is to keep the players on track. What are the realities? What are we doing well? What do we need to be better at? Where actually are we?\"\n\nThere have been several elements to the recrimination that followed the Serbia game. There has been much media dissatisfaction with the play of Phil Foden, who seemed unable to combine effectively with Bellingham in his unfamiliar role on the left.\n\nDoubts were also raised about the compatibility of Trent Alexander-Arnold in central midfield, considering his most frequent use at club level has always been at right-back.\n\nHowever, Southgate has never been one to cave to outside voices and multiple reports indicate he is planning to keep the same team against Denmark, which drew 1-1 with Slovenia in its opener.\n\n\"There's going to be a narrative around a player, a couple of players, after every England game,\" he said. \"This is a different world to the one you experience at clubs.\n\n\"The players as a collective recognize that now. We talked with them about it. It's very rare at their club they'd win a game and experience what they've experienced here.\"\n\nPart of the reason for the extra glare is because of the feeling that things have been building to this point. Southgate has been in charge for eight years and has had more sustained success than any England coach of modern times.\n\nHe is perhaps as popular as an England boss can possibly be without having a title to his name, yet there is also a sense of frustration from the masses that his team have not gotten over the line.\n\nThey came close at the 2018 World Cup. Losing to Croatia after leading late in the semifinal. In the Euros final held in 2021, they led Italy before losing on penalties, heartbreakingly, on home soil.\n\nAt the 2022 World Cup they gave France a scare, but lost 2-1 in the quarterfinal after Kane missed a crucial penalty.\n\nThis time, England would guarantee progress to the knockout stage with a win against Denmark, its semifinal opponent at the last Euros in a game that went to extra-time at Wembley Stadium.\n\nEven a draw would ensure it kept its fate in its own hands heading into the final game of the Group C schedule.\n\nSouthgate said that while there are a number of young players in his squad, there is also a core that has a wealth of experience. Even Bellingham, though just 20, is coming off a Champions League win with Real Madrid, was named La Liga player of the year and is taking part in his third international tournament.\n\nFigures like Kane, Declan Rice and defenders John Stones and Kyle Walker are responsible for maintaining the positive vibe around the camp. And though some of the barbs aimed at Southgate revolve around his perceived unwillingness to make necessary changes, he defended his process.\n\n\"It's great that we have experienced players that have lived through it who (help us) stay on track,\" he said. \"Our own assessment of the game is the most important.\n\n\"We are never slow to pull things up that aren't right.

No one can surely continue to believe such nonsense after yet another utterly toothless and dire display of footballing cluelessness. The match ended as a 1-1 draw but make no mistake: England were a shambles.\n\nThe team showed all the familiar failings we have come to expect from them playing at major tournaments under Southgate. Brilliant and talented footballers, who regularly excel for their clubs, are reduced to shadows of themselves under Southgate's tutelage. The team was simply bereft of direction, ambition and leadership. Worryingly, the captain Harry Kane looked utterly lost, almost as if he didn't know what he was being asked to do in this team. His performance was so poor that, on the BBC, pundits Micah Richards and Rio Ferdinand both called for Harry Kane to be taken off. Even presenter Gary Lineker questioned Kane's performance. Troubling times indeed.\n\nThe worrying signs were there from the start of the match. England started slowly in a cagey and low-key opening. Neither team managed to quite take the upper hand. Even so, it was England who took the lead in the 18th minute, courtesy of Harry Kane's shot.\n\nEngland - being Southgate's England - simply switched off after the goal, gradually conceding more ground and possession, eventually allowing Denmark back into the game. This is almost exactly what happened in the opening match against Serbia. Does this team learn any lessons? Is the manager watching the same game as fans in the ground and television viewers?\n\nAs the first half progressed, England continued to retreat deeper into their own half, and it was a case of when, not if, Denmark would score the equaliser. It duly came when Morten Hjulmund scored from 25 yards out in the 34th minute. There was no real response from England, who trudged off at half time, disconsolate and in need of regrouping.\n\nAnyone who knows anything about Southgate's shortcomings when it comes to reading the flow of a game will not have been surprised that he changed nothing at half time. There were no substitutions and no discernible change in formation. England predictably started the second half in exactly the same way they finished the first 45 minutes, lacking in energy and ideas.\n\nIn the middle of the park, England looked completely lost, despite the manager's pre-match claims that Trent Alexander-Arnold would have a vital role to play. Eight minutes into the second half, Alexander-Arnold was hauled off and replaced by Conor Gallagher - the exact same substitution was made in the game against Serbia.\n\nThe match continued to drift away from England, with Denmark growing in confidence. 70 minutes into the match, Southgate finally gambled, making a triple substitution in a belated effort to deal with England's lacklustre performance up front. Ollie Watkins, Jarrod Bowen and Ebereche Eze came on for Phil Foden, Harry Kane and Bukayo Saka.\n\nIt says everything about England and Southgate that players of the calibre of Kane, Foden and Saka were anonymous in the game and rightly substituted. Denmark had the better of the second half, coming close to scoring a winner on a couple of occasions. Only one team looked like winning and it wasn't England. Just as illuminating is that Denmark may not have England's playing talent but they had a game plan, a structure and every player knew their role. No one can honestly say that about England.\n\nSouthgate, in his post-match comments accepted that the performance wasn't good enough and that the team needed to be better at keeping the ball. He has big problems to solve if England are to progress deep into this tournament. The midfield is a mess and Trent offers no obvious answers. The defence looks wobbly, even against relatively weak teams. Up front, England offer little, lacking shape and attacking threat.\n\nThis has to be down to the coaching and tactics. What has Southgate been doing in the lead-up to this tournament? He has some of the best players in the world at his disposal but appears unable to use them properly. The biggest issue now is the role of Kane, his captain. There is a case to be made for dropping him. Is Southgate brave enough to do that? England will quickly need to find a game plan that uses Kane in a way that works for him and the team.\n\nThis team under Gareth Southgate remain something of a mystery, continuing to befuddle and bewilder rather than bedazzle at Euro 24. They can be infuriating and depressing to watch. Tonight's match against Denmark at the Frankfurt Arena is just the latest evidence that they are a team that is less than the sum of its parts, held back by a manager who really doesn't appear have the chops at the top level.\n\nEngland were humbled tonight by an average Denmark team. The good news is that they are still in control of the group, all but guaranteed to qualify. It's not too late to make changes and learn lessons but Southgate has to get it right pretty quickly.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jawad_iqbal@spectator.us", "name": "Jawad Iqbal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Richards", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Micah Richards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lineker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gary Lineker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Ferdinand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rio Ferdinand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrod_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrod Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2157862421-e1718909653785.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658686", "eventUri": "eng-9658686", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

He's somebody that's going to cause opposition players to be aware that we can play balls in behind them at any point with fantastic accuracy.\n\n\"His understanding of the game is good. All the defensive responsibilities we've asked of him, it's not necessarily been where he's played for many years but he's been really diligent and open to wanting to take that on board. So, look, we know it's a work in progress.\n\n\"We know it's something that's going to get a lot of attention as it's not been the norm. But we feel it's something that can add to what we've got.\"\n\nLuke Shaw remains absent as the Manchester United defender battles to recover full fitness, with Kieran Trippier again playing out of position on the left.\n\nSouthgate, speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, said: \"Luke won't be involved tomorrow, he's on track for what we thought originally. He needs a bit more work. There are days when he needs to do more than the rest and needs to recover.\n\n\"He's still in and out with the others and operating on his own programme as well.\"\n\nEngland's clash against the Danes will be a repeat of their Euro 2020 semi-final match.\n\nThe Three Lions won 2-1 in extra-time to secure their spot in the final but lost to Italy following a penalty shootout.\n\nVictory on

Ex-players from Alan Shearer and David Seaman have been queuing up to have their say on Foden after he was outshone by Jude Bellingham 's performance against Serbia.\n\nBut Foden covered more ground than any other England player - 13.2km - and has been given a major vote of confidence by Southgate ahead of their clash with Denmark on Thursday night. England boss Southgate said: \"Phil did an exceptional job for us on Sunday. Other players grabbed the attention, but the way he worked for the team, defended the spaces, real intelligence in how he played.\n\n\"Towards the end of the game he retained the ball for us in really crucial moments.

But Southgate will resist making any changes as England look to secure qualification for the knockout stages of the competition with a win.\n\nBukayo Saka was replaced by Jarrod Bowen after 76 minutes in the only other change in the Serbia game. The Arsenal star enjoyed a superb first-half before being shackled somewhat later on but is also expected to keep his place.\n\nCole Palmer, who scored 27 times in his first season at Chelsea, was an unused substitute that night and will likely have to wait until the final group game against Slovenia next Tuesday to get his chance.\n\nMarc Guehi enjoyed a superb Euros debut as part of a backline that included Kieran Trippier at left-back. The Newcastle United star is deputising for Luke Shaw who will remain unavailable this week.\n\nThe Manchester United defender has not played any football since February due to a muscle injury but has been stepping up his return in the England camp. Shaw was back in first-team training last week but moved back to an individual programme on Wednesday with Southgate confirming he will not be involved against the Danes.\n\n'Luke won't be involved tomorrow. He's actually on track for where we thought he would be originally,' Southgate said in his pre-match press conference. 'We were hoping a couple of days ago he might accelerate that bit but he needs a bit more volume work.\n\n'He didn't train with group today because there are days when he needs to do more than the rest of the group and days when he needs to recover when the others are pushing. He is still in and out from the others but operating on his own programme as well.'\n\nHaving reached the final of the last European Championship, standards and expectations are understandably high for Southgate and his side.\n\n'I've been in this environment for eight years so I understand it all,' Southgate said. 'It used to annoy me and now I'm ambivalent to it.\n\n'Winning matches in tournaments is incredibly hard. In this tournament you've now got incredible support for all the teams in the stadiums as well which is a little different to the last two tournaments.\n\n'We've had some good results over the years so maybe even we take results for granted, I should let the boys enjoy it more than they do. I hope they have a little bit longer than me!\n\n'There should be more joy in it but it's not my reality if I'm frank. My focus is to get qualified from the group, two tough opponents and two games to achieve that.'\n\nMORE : Theo Walcott wants 'fearless' England star to replace Phil Foden in starting XI against

Keep going. Cheers!\" This was not a direct quote from Kyle Walker as he signed off in typically cheery fashion from a chat with the UK press before England's Group C Euro 2024 match against Denmark on Thursday. But it was not far off and absolutely the thrust of things.\n\nThere has been the temptation to wonder whether there is a siege mentality taking hold within the England setup. Put yourself in the players' shoes, especially the 13 who were a part of a tournament \u00admatch-day squad for the first time on \u00adSunday when England opened with a 1-0 win against Serbia, \u00adexperiencing the \u00adcraziness of it all. And the subsequent \u00adreaction.\n\nIt was intense, the analysis of every detail forensic - as it always is. Why did Harry Kane hardly touch the ball in the first half? Is Trent \u00adAlexander-Arnold the answer in midfield? What is going on with Phil Foden? Whisper it, is Jude Bellingham trying to do too much? To repeat: England won 1-0.\n\nIt has emerged that Gareth \u00adSouthgate addressed the squad on Tuesday night to explain, as he put it, how this was a \"different world\" to the one the players normally inhabit. \"It's very rare at their clubs they'd win a game and experience what they've experienced over the last couple of days,\" the manager said.\n\nThis is England. And yet this is not a siege mentality. A siege mentality in the classic sense involves pulling the shutters down, saying nothing in public or some \u00adaggressively \u00addefiant stuff at best. Think of the masters such as Sir Alex Ferguson and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho.\n\nA siege mentality does not involve good relationships with the journalists, being calm and friendly, giving insightful interviews and seeming to enjoy them. Maybe call it a Southgate siege mentality: \u00admeasured, plenty of understanding and empathy.\n\nThere is nonetheless an impression that the squad is a little bemused by the fallout from the Serbia game and is pulling together, looking to the leaders - including Walker - for guidance.\n\nAt 34, Walker is the \u00adsenior statesman. He is in his fifth tour\u00adnament. He has 84 caps; only Kane from this squad has more with 92. Walker has admitted he had to be talked out of international retirement by \u00adSouthgate after the \u00adprevious two tournaments but he made it clear here that he wanted to go on for some time.\n\n\"I look at Pepe playing for Portugal and he is 41 ... the likes of Luka Modric [who is 38],\" Walker said. \"They're the levels people are setting. If they can do it, why can't I? What is my timescale for how long I want to go on? How long's a piece of string? A lot of people do bang on about my age but age is just a number to me. I still feel quick, I still feel strong, I still feel young. And even at my age I still want to learn.\"\n\nWalker was interesting when he addressed the noise outside the England camp; how he deals with it. And it is no great stretch to \u00adimagine him preaching to others what he practises.\n\n\"I don't have anything [in terms of social media], I don't look at anything,\" the vice-captain said.\n\n\"I feel that I'm in here and this is the only little bubble. When you start listening to outside noise or good press and bad press, it affects different people in different ways. If you were to write good things or bad things about me ... if I don't read it, I don't react and don't change my \u00adopinion on what I'm going to approach a game like.\n\n\"I concentrate on what's in this camp. What the manager says, what the people around me and teammates are saying. When we get that \u00adscrutiny after beating a well\u2011drilled Serbia team 1-0, we have to take it as a positive in that people expect so much of us. But we cannot take away that we came away with three points, a clean sheet and in a good stead for Denmark.\"\n\nSouthgate also said that he was not \"reading a thing or listening to a thing\", although he is aware of the various discussion points \"because they get sent to you\". What he wanted to impart was his considered view on the Serbia match, having had the time to pore over it, and how it would inform the approach against Denmark.\n\nSouthgate liked the way England kept and moved the ball in the first 30 minutes, the period defined by \u00adBellingham's goal. He also talked up the impact his substitutes made - Conor Gallagher, Jarrod Bowen and Kobbie Mainoo.\n\nHe did not like the low levels of chance creation, even during the initial purple patch, and how his team came to lack the correct structure to build the play, the right overloads. It was a part of why they lacked control, seemingly inviting Serbia on.\n\n\"The other reason was individual errors with the ball,\" Southgate said. \"Poor detail on passes. We have challenged everybody to take that next step.\"\n\nSouthgate said that Alexander-Arnold was not going to be a midfielder \"who dictates tempo\" like, say, Modric or Toni Kroos. But he continues to believe that the Liverpool player could open up compact defences with the range of his passing. Without the ball, he has been open to taking on the responsibilities required.\n\n\"We know it's a work in progress,\" Southgate said. \"We know it's something that's going to get a lot of attention as it's not been the norm. But we feel it's something that can add to what we've got.\"\n\nSouthgate was fiercely protective of Foden but he perhaps lowered his guard momentarily when \u00addiscussing Bellingham. \"He definitely got 90 minutes of running into 45; I think the occasion, the emotion, scoring ...\" Southgate said. It was as though he felt Bellingham had been too all\u2011action in some of the wrong areas.\n\n\"I mean, he had a phenomenal impact on the game and the great thing is that he is really coachable,\" Southgate said. \"We can sit and talk things through. We've got to get the right balance of not losing what he's already bringing. And also, can we sow one or two things - as with all the players - that we can refine and get even more from him?

We had to suffer a bit, which I think is really good for us to come through and to defend our box in the way we did under pressure is important for the group.

Manchester United head coach Erik ten Hag spoke this week of how Southgate too frequently seems content to get into an early lead, then instantly adopt a defensive mindset, aiming to close out the game.\n\nThe difficulty with that comes if there is a ton of time left on the clock. That's what happened in the Euros final in the summer of 2021 and it is exactly what took place on Thursday, where Harry Kane scored on 18 minutes and England then went passive.\n\nSuddenly, Denmark's crew of talented midfield players found themselves with space and time to create something of value. It didn't take long for Morten Hjulmand to poach the ball off Kane in a low-lying position and smash home the equalizer.\n\n\"There is a huge amount of work,\" Southgate told reporters. \"That's evident from the two performances we've given and we've got to be tight. We understand people will be disappointed with the performances and rightly so, and we've got to make them better.\n\n\"(This) I clearly not what we've hoped for. We are not using the ball well enough and we have to accept that if you do that you will suffer at times, as we have tonight. We know there is a level we have to find.\"\n\nSouthgate denied that he instructs his teams to become actively more cautious once they go into the lead.\n\n\"No,\" he said. 'We've played teams that are fluid and it is not easy to get pressure on them. We have got to do better than we have in the last two matches.\"\n\nEngland next plays Slovenia in Cologne on Tuesday. A win would secure the top spot in Group C; a point would ensure qualification and may be enough for first place.\n\nBetween now and then, the conversation will again revolve heavily around the formation. Southgate admitted that using Trent Alexander-Arnold in the center of midfield had been an \"experiment\", and it is one that has surely now ended. Replacing Alexander-Arnold with Conor Gallagher just after halftime was a clear indicator of that.\n\nPhil Foden was allowed to play more often in the middle but his connection with Jude Bellingham still didn't work out. Declan Rice had an awful game, often losing possession.\n\nAnd in the most surprising move of all, Southgate replaced his entire front three -- Foden, Bukayo Saka and captain Kane -- with 20 minutes left.\n\nEngland has an avalanche of talent, but there is a growing feeling that Southgate doesn't know what to do with it all. While there has been a complete absence of innovation and ingenuity on the left side, Cole Palmer, who had such a sensational impact on the English Premier League last season, remains stuck on the bench. So too, does Anthony Gordon, perhaps the purest \"left-\" based player in the camp.\n\n[Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

He said: \"He's less likely to be a player who dictates tempo.\n\n\"What I do see is that range of passing, and that ability to open up a defence that might be blocking spaces, defending low. He's somebody that's going to cause opposition players to be aware that we can play balls in behind them at any point, with fantastic accuracy.\n\n\"His understanding of the game is good.

We know it's something that's going to get a lot of attention, as it's not been the norm. But we feel it's something that can add to what we've got.\"\n\nEngland will come up against a familiar face in the shape of Denmark veteran Christian Eriksen.

Three Lions boss Southgate has also insisted that, despite the lack of experience in the squad, there is depth and competition for places as Conor Gallagher and Jarrod Bowen both played roles as substitutes against Serbia.\n\nSouthgate said: \"The guys backing up the XI does not have as many caps as we might have had in the past but as we saw with Gallagher and Bowen, there are players that are ready to come in and have an impact immediately.\n\n\"There are others that are training really well that we wouldn't hesitate to put into the game.

This was a 1-1 that meant a lot more than failing to win this match. It raises the biggest questions yet over whether England can even come close to winning this tournament. Almost nothing about the team works right now. If that seems harsh given they have four points and are still on course to top the group, it is about how Gareth Southgate has currently made this team so much less than the sum of their parts.\n\nThe biggest problem is in midfield, which admittedly isn't new and has been the long-term issue. The concern is how Southgate has so far compounded it. Why persist with the Trent Alexander-Arnold experiment, when it obviously didn't work? Why keep him on at half-time, only to change it minutes later?\n\nSouthgate then himself veered drastically from that hesitancy to an unusually bold move. He hauled off the entire front three of Bukayo Saka, Phil Foden and - most amazingly - goalscorer Harry Kane.\n\nThere may yet be echoes of Graham Taylor taking off Gary Lineker at Euro '92, depending on how this tournament goes. A lot needs to change. Much bolder moves are going to be needed, and Southgate is going to have to stop being concerned with leaving out some of his biggest names. A balanced, integrated team is much more important.\n\nThat was what was so significant about that decision to take off his frontline. It was an admission that the long build-up to this tournament hadn't worked. Coaches don't usually make moves like that because it is too jarring for a team's tactical ideal. The obvious question from that is \"what tactical ideal\"?\n\nSouthgate was seen pointing to his head after Denmark wasted yet another late chance, telling his players to concentrate. He has a lot of thinking to do.\n\nThe Danes, meanwhile, should only reflect on a wasted opportunity. They could and should have won this game. They were that superior, especially in basic structure.\n\nEven England's goal showed that in its own way.\n\nIt was almost like Denmark were so in control that Victor Kristiansen got complacent, but Kyle Walker's alertness should also be praised. With the Leicester City defender inexplicably laboured, what could have been an easy pick-up near his box saw Walker just bundle him off the ball. The right-back just surged through to try and clip the ball back for Kane. It eventually made its way through after a bounce, for the striker to hit his first of the tournament, and one of the easiest he'll get.\n\nIt just didn't get any way easier for England. It was instead much harder. They of course retreated in that way they always do, while Denmark were sparked into something more. They looked something more, despite notionally inferior players. The performance showed how dependent England were on reacting to and countering Kasper Hjulmand's team. Southgate's were only ever looking to get into the gaps left in the Danish structure, but they were becoming fewer and smaller.\n\nOne of the most striking contrasts between the sides was how there always seemed to be these swathes of space between England's midfield, while Denmark's worked in these tight triangles. It was like there was always Danish pass on within five yards. With England, the gap between players could be anything at any given moment.\n\nDenmark had been threatening for some time when the manager's son evidently felt Southgate had enough warning. Martin Hjulmand let loose a low drive that just whistled through the air and in off Jordan Pickford's right post. It was no more than Denmark deserved.\n\nSouthgate had to change something, and surprisingly gave the midfield experiment another eight minutes before introducing Conor Gallagher for Alexander-Arnold.\n\nOne question was why he didn't make the change at half-time. A bigger question was why he persisted with the formation despite the evidence of the Serbia match.\n\nGallagher's first intervention was crucial. He cleared a ball that looked set to drop for Denmark just yards from goal.\n\nIt still wasn't enough. Although Foden had hit the post from yet another individual moment, there was no more coherence to England's play.\n\nSouthgate then went for his boldest move yet, hauled off his whole front three.\n\nAs desperate as that seemed, though, some logic was still discernible. Ollie Watkins offered the runs in behind that Kane couldn't. Jarrod Bowen offered crossing and sudden breaks. Eberechi Eze offered more direct dribbling and long shots.\n\nAny one of them could of course have done something, but it was what England were reduced to.\n\nIt looked so small and insignificant, compared to what a side like Germany are doing.\n\nFootball history has made fools of those who hastily write off a struggling team in the group stage, and England do still have four points to stay on top of the group.\n\nWhat can be said for certain, however, is that England need almost everything to improve. One of the few positives was Marc Guehi. That is something else England are reduced to: looking to the performance of young stand-ins.\n\nEngland didn't look like stepping up to be champions. They barely looked like a functioning team.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graham Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lineker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gary Lineker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Kristiansen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victor Kristiansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leicester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasper_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kasper Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "German Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrod_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrod Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/706a61fc6cf2571064c29905843278de", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658686", "eventUri": "eng-9658686", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Keep going. Cheers!\" This was not a direct quote from Kyle Walker as he signed off in typically cheery fashion from a chat with the UK press before England's Group C Euro 2024 match against Denmark on Thursday. But it was not far off and absolutely the thrust of things.\n\nThere has been the temptation to wonder whether there is a siege mentality taking hold within the England setup. Put yourself in the players' shoes, especially the 13 who were a part of a tournament \u00admatch-day squad for the first time on \u00adSunday when England opened with a 1-0 win against Serbia, \u00adexperiencing the \u00adcraziness of it all. And the subsequent \u00adreaction.\n\nIt was intense, the analysis of every detail forensic - as it always is. Why did Harry Kane hardly touch the ball in the first half? Is Trent \u00adAlexander-Arnold the answer in midfield? What is going on with Phil Foden? Whisper it, is Jude Bellingham trying to do too much? To repeat: England won 1-0.\n\nRelated: Kobbie Mainoo stays cool as clamour for England midfield spot grows\n\nIt has emerged that Gareth \u00adSouthgate addressed the squad on Tuesday night to explain, as he put it, how this was a \"different world\" to the one the players normally inhabit. \"It's very rare at their clubs they'd win a game and experience what they've experienced over the last couple of days,\" the manager said.\n\nThis is England. And yet this is not a siege mentality. A siege mentality in the classic sense involves pulling the shutters down, saying nothing in public or some \u00adaggressively \u00addefiant stuff at best. Think of the masters such as Sir Alex Ferguson and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho.\n\nA siege mentality does not involve good relationships with the journalists, being calm and friendly, giving insightful interviews and seeming to enjoy them. Maybe call it a Southgate siege mentality: \u00admeasured, plenty of understanding and empathy.\n\nThere is nonetheless an impression that the squad is a little bemused by the fallout from the Serbia game and is pulling together, looking to the leaders - including Walker - for guidance.\n\nAt 34, Walker is the \u00adsenior statesman. He is in his fifth tour\u00adnament. He has 84 caps; only Kane from this squad has more with 92. Walker has admitted he had to be talked out of international retirement by \u00adSouthgate after the \u00adprevious two tournaments but he made it clear here that he wanted to go on for some time.\n\n\"I look at Pepe playing for Portugal and he is 41 ... the likes of Luka Modric [who is 38],\" Walker said. \"They're the levels people are setting. If they can do it, why can't I? What is my timescale for how long I want to go on? How long's a piece of string? A lot of people do bang on about my age but age is just a number to me. I still feel quick, I still feel strong, I still feel young. And even at my age I still want to learn.\"\n\nWalker was interesting when he addressed the noise outside the England camp; how he deals with it. And it is no great stretch to \u00adimagine him preaching to others what he practises.\n\n\"I don't have anything [in terms of social media], I don't look at anything,\" the vice-captain said.\n\n\"I feel that I'm in here and this is the only little bubble. When you start listening to outside noise or good press and bad press, it affects different people in different ways. If you were to write good things or bad things about me ... if I don't read it, I don't react and don't change my \u00adopinion on what I'm going to approach a game like.\n\n\"I concentrate on what's in this camp. What the manager says, what the people around me and teammates are saying. When we get that \u00adscrutiny after beating a well\u2011drilled Serbia team 1-0, we have to take it as a positive in that people expect so much of us. But we cannot take away that we came away with three points, a clean sheet and in a good stead for Denmark.\"\n\nSouthgate also said that he was not \"reading a thing or listening to a thing\", although he is aware of the various discussion points \"because they get sent to you\". What he wanted to impart was his considered view on the Serbia match, having had the time to pore over it, and how it would inform the approach against Denmark.\n\nRelated: Like a modern John Barnes, Foden is at risk of being England's conundrum | Jacob Steinberg\n\nSouthgate liked the way England kept and moved the ball in the first 30 minutes, the period defined by \u00adBellingham's goal. He also talked up the impact his substitutes made - Conor Gallagher, Jarrod Bowen and Kobbie Mainoo.\n\nHe did not like the low levels of chance creation, even during the initial purple patch, and how his team came to lack the correct structure to build the play, the right overloads. It was a part of why they lacked control, seemingly inviting Serbia on.\n\n\"The other reason was individual errors with the ball,\" Southgate said. \"Poor detail on passes. We have challenged everybody to take that next step.\"\n\nSouthgate said that Alexander-Arnold was not going to be a midfielder \"who dictates tempo\" like, say, Modric or Toni Kroos. But he continues to believe that the Liverpool player could open up compact defences with the range of his passing. Without the ball, he has been open to taking on the responsibilities required.\n\n\"We know it's a work in progress,\" Southgate said. \"We know it's something that's going to get a lot of attention as it's not been the norm. But we feel it's something that can add to what we've got.\"\n\nSouthgate was fiercely protective of Foden but he perhaps lowered his guard momentarily when \u00addiscussing Bellingham. \"He definitely got 90 minutes of running into 45; I think the occasion, the emotion, scoring ...\" Southgate said. It was as though he felt Bellingham had been too all\u2011action in some of the wrong areas.\n\n\"I mean, he had a phenomenal impact on the game and the great thing is that he is really coachable,\" Southgate said. \"We can sit and talk things through. We've got to get the right balance of not losing what he's already bringing. And also, can we sow one or two things - as with all the players - that we can refine and get even more from him? That's always the challenge.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_mentality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Siege mentality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southgate,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Modri\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Modri\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_(footballer,_born_1983)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pepe (footballer, born 1983)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mourinho", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Barnes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashley Barnes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toni_Kroos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toni Kroos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrod_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrod Bowen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Policy_and_Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Policy and Advocacy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Mental_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Mental Health", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/a1eafc926551e3afa73db181b852a14b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658686", "eventUri": "eng-9658686", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Gareth Southgate led his players over to the England fans after the final whistle and, as they clapped the ever loyal support, you felt they should have been apologising.\n\nNo wonder there was some booing at the final whistle. The England fans deserved better. Make no mistake. England were fortunate to get a draw and a point at least means if they beat Slovenia next Tuesday then they will top the group. All is not lost.\n\nBut what England have lost is optimism and momentum. They looked tired, lethargic and without a plan. Denmark were the better team as they had more hunger and desire.\n\nEngland's big players did not turn up. Even Harry Kane got substituted. Jude Bellingham was brilliant against Serbia but got so frustrated against Denmark. Nothing went right for him.\n\nKane was gifted the 18th-minute opener but England could not even hold onto that lead for long. This must be a brutal wake-up call for England - otherwise they will be going home pretty quickly.\n\nThis felt like the bad old days from before Southgate's reign when England flopped and did not do themselves justice at tournaments. They certainly did not turn up in Frankfurt.\n\nEngland were woeful at times. This was a performance which should send Southgate back to the drawing board. The system, the players and the tactics just did not work.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold is just not working in midfield. His passing was poor and he offers no protection to his defence. Even Declan Rice, normally so reliable, was caught dribbling out of his own penalty box.\n\nKane was substituted with 20 minutes left because he had run out of steam which was a familiar story through the whole team. England boss Southgate did not seem to be able to make the right substitutions and was not brave enough to make the most obvious one of all.\n\nIf it is not working - and it was not working for Bellingham - then sometimes you even have to take off your best player. The crazy thing was that England were gift-wrapped a goal. Kyle Walker robbed Victor Kristiansen, put over a low cross which was deflected and there was Kane to score his 64th goal for England in 93 caps.\n\nBut rather than try to press home their advantage, they sat back. England were a shambles. Kane's poor clearance fell to Kristiansen and then Morten Hjulmand rifled in a low shot from 25 yards off the post.\n\nNo-one closed him down and no-one pressed all night. That is what happens when you use players out of position. Half-time could not come quick enough for England. They were hanging on.\n\nSouthgate hooked Alexander-Arnold just nine minutes into the second half and replaced him with Conor Gallagher's energy and work-rate. England's balance was immediately better and the tide began to turn a little. Bukayo Saka hit the side netting. Phil Foden smashed a low 20-yard drive against the post.\n\nSouthgate had seen enough by 70 minutes. Saka, Kane and Foden were all taken off for Jarrod Bowen, Eberechi Eze and Ollie Watkins. They at least brought more energy but England could not find a way. And now they head to Cologne needing to find some answers pretty quickly.\n\nSouthgate looked lost on the touchline. Out of ideas and maybe out of time. And, worst of all, England's players looked tired on the back of a long, hard season.

There's a lot of hard work ahead.\"\n\nDenmark can exact some revenge against England, who edged them 2-1 in the semi-finals of the 2020 European Championship.\n\nThe Danes drew 1-1 with Slovenia in their opener on Saturday, an afternoon flushed with emotion at the return to the Euros of midfielder Christian Eriksen. Three years after he suffered a cardiac arrest during play at the last tournament, Eriksen scored the Danes' lone goal.\n\nHe was the only Danish player to maintain his level throughout the game, however, and they conceded an equalizer in a disappointing result.\n\nDenmark have tasted glory on the international stage, winning the 1992 European Championship -- an accomplishment that has eluded England in their 10 previous appearances. Their loss to Italy in the 2020 final was the Three Lions' best result.\n\nOn the heels of his outstanding season at Real Madrid, the 20-year-old Bellingham showed on Sunday that he is ready to shoulder the heavy England expectations, joining fellow Englishman Michael Owen as only players to score at both a European Championship and a World Cup before the age of 21.\n\nManager Gareth Southgate was delighted with the player's impact.\n\n\"He writes his own script,\" \u00adhe said. \"The timing of his runs, it was a super bit of play in the buildup to the goal as well. I think all of our forward \u00adplayers looked really good. I am confident we will score goals.\"\n\nGoalkeeper Jordan Pickford was pressed into action with a late leaping save to preserve the win, as England have gone five consecutive Euro group stage matches without conceding a goal, stretching back to the 2016 game against Wales.\n\nEngland had to fend off an attacking Serbia in the second half on Saturday, and Southgate saw the positives of his patched-up back line being tested.\n\n\"I'm pleased that we had to show a different side, we had to show that resilience to defend our box because I think as a group that really builds a huge spirit,\" Southgate said.\n\nIn Southgate's debrief, he will have undoubtedly looked at lack of production from defender Kieran Tripper and midfielder Phil Foden on the left side, particularly after Foden's breakout season with Manchester City.\n\nEngland were fortunate to open the tournament with a victory, but it did not entirely feel like one -- they have the chance to ramp-up the feelgood factor against Denmark.", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Eriksen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christian Eriksen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardiac arrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Owen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Owen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Swamp_Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Swamp Soccer", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658686", "eventUri": "eng-9658686", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

The first was in 2020 against Croatia when Southgate was also in charge.\n\n\"I've been in this environment for eight years, so I understand (the negativity). It used to annoy me, now I'm ambivalent to it,\" Southgate told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n\"Winning matches in tournaments is incredibly hard. And this tournament, you've now got the extra dimension of incredible support (from travelling fans) for all the teams in the stadiums as well. So that's a little bit different to the last two tournaments we've been in.\"\n\nLoaded with attacking talent, England arrived as one of the favourites, but the win over was Serbia was laboured and they had to hang on grimly in the second half.\n\n\"Maybe even we sort of take wins for granted, which we shouldn't,\" Southgate said. \"I should definitely let the boys enjoy their wins more than they do. I get about 45 seconds of enjoyment, the whistle blows, I cuddle everybody, I walk off the pitch and then that's it.\"\n\nSouthgate does not discourage his players from reading newspapers or engaging on social media, but the 53-year-old prefers to stay in a bubble at major tournaments.\n\n\"My world's a happier place if I shut myself off,\" he said. \"It's not good from a global perspective because I haven't got a clue what's going on in politics or events elsewhere. But for the next month, that's going to be a better place for me.\n\n\"There's more noise around every national team than there ever is in a club team, millions of people in your own country, extensively media coverage, social media, one guy writing a comment on social media gets put in a newspaper, now that's a story,\" he added. \"So, it's a different world.\"\n\nDefender Kyle Walker also steers clear of press coverage.\n\n\"If you have outside noise, people take it in different ways, so I'd rather not see it and just concentrate on what's in camp, what the gaffer says, what my mum says,\" he said. \"Mum always tells me I have a good game.\"\n\nEngland will again be without Luke Shaw as he continues with his recovery from injury.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nIf Gareth Southgate has already warned his players to ignore criticism, he's going to need to lock them away in Erfurt after this. This was a 1-1 that meant a lot more than failing to win this match. It raises the biggest questions yet over whether England can even come close to winning this tournament. Almost nothing about the team works right now. If that seems harsh given they have four points and are still on course to top the group, it is about how Gareth Southgate has currently made this team so much less than the sum of their parts.\n\nThe biggest problem is in midfield, which admittedly isn't new and has been the long-term issue. The concern is how Southgate has so far compounded it. Why persist with the Trent Alexander-Arnold experiment, when it obviously didn't work? Why keep him on at half-time, only to change it minutes later?\n\nSouthgate then himself veered drastically from that hesitancy to an unusually bold move. He hauled off the entire front three of Bukayo Saka, Phil Foden and - most amazingly - goalscorer Harry Kane.\n\nThere may yet be echoes of Graham Taylor taking off Gary Lineker at Euro '92, depending on how this tournament goes. A lot needs to change. Much bolder moves are going to be needed, and Southgate is going to have to stop being concerned with leaving out some of his biggest names. A balanced, integrated team is much more important.\n\nThat was what was so significant about that decision to take off his frontline. It was an admission that the long build-up to this tournament hadn't worked. Coaches don't usually make moves like that because it is too jarring for a team's tactical ideal. The obvious question from that is \"what tactical ideal\"?\n\nSouthgate was seen pointing to his head after Denmark wasted yet another late chance, telling his players to concentrate. He has a lot of thinking to do.\n\nThe Danes, meanwhile, should only reflect on a wasted opportunity. They could and should have won this game. They were that superior, especially in basic structure.\n\nEven England's goal showed that in its own way.\n\nIt was almost like Denmark were so in control that Victor Kristiansen got complacent, but Kyle Walker's alertness should also be praised. With the Leicester City defender inexplicably laboured, what could have been an easy pick-up near his box saw Walker just bundle him off the ball. The right-back just surged through to try and clip the ball back for Kane. It eventually made its way through after a bounce, for the striker to hit his first of the tournament, and one of the easiest he'll get.\n\nIt just didn't get any way easier for England. It was instead much harder. They of course retreated in that way they always do, while Denmark were sparked into something more. They looked something more, despite notionally inferior players. The performance showed how dependent England were on reacting to and countering Kasper Hjulmand's team. Southgate's were only ever looking to get into the gaps left in the Danish structure, but they were becoming fewer and smaller.\n\nOne of the most striking contrasts between the sides was how there always seemed to be these swathes of space between England's midfield, while Denmark's worked in these tight triangles. It was like there was always Danish pass on within five yards. With England, the gap between players could be anything at any given moment.\n\nDenmark had been threatening for some time when the manager's son evidently felt Southgate had enough warning. Martin Hjulmand let loose a low drive that just whistled through the air and in off Jordan Pickford's right post. It was no more than Denmark deserved.\n\nSouthgate had to change something, and surprisingly gave the midfield experiment another eight minutes before introducing Conor Gallagher for Alexander-Arnold.\n\nOne question was why he didn't make the change at half-time. A bigger question was why he persisted with the formation despite the evidence of the Serbia match.\n\nGallagher's first intervention was crucial. He cleared a ball that looked set to drop for Denmark just yards from goal.\n\nIt still wasn't enough. Although Foden had hit the post from yet another individual moment, there was no more coherence to England's play.\n\nSouthgate then went for his boldest move yet, hauled off his whole front three.\n\nAs desperate as that seemed, though, some logic was still discernible. Ollie Watkins offered the runs in behind that Kane couldn't. Jarrod Bowen offered crossing and sudden breaks. Eberechi Eze offered more direct dribbling and long shots.\n\nAny one of them could of course have done something, but it was what England were reduced to.\n\nIt looked so small and insignificant, compared to what a side like Germany are doing.\n\nFootball history has made fools of those who hastily write off a struggling team in the group stage, and England do still have four points to stay on top of the group.\n\nWhat can be said for certain, however, is that England need almost everything to improve. One of the few positives was Marc Guehi. That is something else England are reduced to: looking to the performance of young stand-ins.\n\nEngland didn't look like stepping up to be champions. They barely looked like a functioning team.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graham Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lineker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gary Lineker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Kristiansen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victor Kristiansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leicester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasper_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kasper Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "German Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrod_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrod Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/20/19/2157858993.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658686", "eventUri": "eng-9658686", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

We have been given a sober reminder that football is about picking the best team, not the best players.\n\nGareth Southgate is encountering what has been an age-old problem for every England manager since 1966. You look at the squad going into a Euros and World Cup, see a talented group who performs well for their club, and you become seduced by the idea of bringing them all together.\n\nEveryone wishing the side well has their favourites - a clamour grows for stars to be included and those who are not selected have never been so highly rated - and then the games come along and the optimism unravels.\n\nThe side selected for the Serbia and Denmark games looked good on paper. It is understandable that Southgate did what he did. I won't rewrite history and criticise it retrospectively. It was worth a try and he was justified in sticking with it for one more fixture. It was a new line-up and the players needed a second chance. The manager wanted to get as much class on the pitch as possible at the same time, and like many of us was drawn to the positives in the opening win in the hope the flaws would be ironed out.\n\nUnfortunately, two of the best Premier League footballers - Trent Alexander-Arnold and Phil Foden - will have to be sacrificed now. The team's set-up is not getting the best from them, or their team-mates.\n\nIntroducing Alexander-Arnold into midfield in a major tournament was always a risk. It has not worked. The experiment ended with his early substitution against Denmark. It is a more physically demanding position than full back, and on the evidence so far Alexander-Arnold has more time and space to utilise his passing range when he is in the hybrid role.\n\nHe delivered the best pass of the game to Bukayo Saka just before he was subbed, but there is an irony that when he plays in his natural position we see four or five of those in a game.\n\nElsewhere in the side, nobody loves watching Foden more than me. But for England to come up with a system that works and complements everyone, he can't operate in the starting XI with Jude Bellingham and Harry Kane if they are all trying to occupy the same space and positions.\n\nEngland need to rethink and zone in on helping the players who have no like-for-like replacements in the squad: Kane and Declan Rice.\n\nKane correctly remains one of the untouchables - a world-class striker. His best work for England is with two pacey wide men. I would like to see a 4-3-3 with Saka and Anthony Gordon either side of Kane.\n\nRice is the only proven and high-class holding midfielder Southgate has, but in the first two games he has been overworked and, at times, overrun. He has never looked so exhausted as he did in the second half against the Danes. He had far too much ground to cover and Danish players started to surround him when in possession.\n\nIn a 4-3-3, Jude Bellingham will drop deeper to assist Rice, and then it is a choice between the remaining midfielders. There are some suggesting Foden should stay in the side with Bellingham deeper. That wouldn't change anything tactically.\n\nIt has to be a midfielder who will bring energy across the pitch like Conor Gallagher, Adam Wharton or Kobbie Mainoo. That's not a negative move; it is an essential one.\n\nToo often the definition of being 'attacking' or 'positive' is to flood the team with goalscorers and creative players. Here's some news for those who did not already know: nobody can score or create a goal without the ball.\n\nThe possession stats in the latter stages of Euros and World Cups are usually around 50-50, or at the most 60-40. You have to accept there will be periods when you suffer. That's why it is so imperative to include those who can win the ball back. The debate with England is often about adding more quality to the line-up. As Southgate recognised post-match, first and foremost they need more energy and dynamism.\n\nMy big worry watching the Denmark game is how shattered so many England players looked. The surest sign of fatigue is dropping too deep. Those trying to claim this was a tactical strategy have got it wrong.\n\nThere is no way Southgate is ordering the team to drop back like that after going one-up. But it has happened too often and he has to fix the line-up to stop it reoccurring.\n\nAnother midfielder alongside Rice will still enable Bellingham to play as an advancing No 8 when we have the ball. The side would look more balanced. It will also help the player and team for Bellingham to have a more disciplined role defensively.\n\nFor Southgate, it is all about being cut-throat and ruthless now to turn the form around. He knows England's history better than anyone.\n\nIn my time, we looked around the dressing room and saw Wayne Rooney, Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard, Paul Scholes and Michael Owen and thought if we could make it click, anyone could be beaten.\n\nIt never happened. Something had to give, but the decision to leave a big name out was never taken when the most consequential games in the knockout phases came along.\n\nFor all the criticism of his reign, Southgate has previously avoided those unfavourable comparisons with the so-called 'golden generation'. This England squad has been as together as any of the past 40 years.\n\nIf there is to be a radical improvement, they have to get back to that immediately, which means Southgate has to show courage, rattle cages and leave out some stars for the greater good.\n\nHe has nothing to lose. He expects to be leaving after this tournament anyway, so he needn't worry about any backlash.\n\nWithout fresh legs and fresh ideas, this tournament will be filed alongside all those which have haunted his predecessors.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Owen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Owen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lampard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Lampard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Scholes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Scholes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gerrard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Gerrard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Rooney"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Y1CfRNo.pFDuvuOpo5LKBQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/3e7163421539892f42260003485dfe57", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658686", "eventUri": "eng-9658686", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Bellingham, 20, was the match-winner against Serbia but his all-round display also marked him down as potentially the biggest star of the whole tournament.\n\nAnd yet even after winning La Liga and the Champions League with Real Madrid, Southgate says England's star man is still willing to listen, learn and is \"very coachable.\" England boss Southgate said: \"He definitely got 90 minutes of running in to 45.\n\n\"The occasion, the emotion, scoring....he had a phenomenal impact on the game and the great thing is that he is really coachable. We can sit and chat and talk things through so we have got to get the right balance of not losing what he is already bringing and also can we sew one or two things - as with all the players - that we can refine a bit and get even more.\n\n\"That's always the challenge. Top players want to be challenged and need to be challenged as well. I don't think you back away from that. Any top individual in any industry wants to be the best he can possibly be.\"\n\nBellingham was front and centre of England's performance against Serbia and if they can repeat their victory against Denmark then Southgate's men will be on course to win their group. But while England got the job done against Serbia, they will face a tougher test against a Denmark team still smarting from their semi-final defeat to England in the last Euros.\n\nWith a better quality of opposition also comes a bigger test for the midfield and one ex-player who was positive about England's performance and victory was Stuart Pearce as 'Psycho' picked out Trent Alexander-Arnold for praise and his passing range.\n\nPearce even compared Alexander-Arnold to Glenn Hoddle and Southgate also focused on the positive aspects of the Liverpool star's game and believes he will only get better against Denmark. Southgate said: \"He's less likely to be a player who dictates tempo than Glenn Hoddle. That's a different type and probably midfield players who have been in there forever and really understand the flow of a game.\n\n\"What I do see is that range of passing and that ability to open up a defence that might be blocking spaces, defending low. He's somebody that's going to cause opposition players to be aware that we can play balls in behind them at any point with fantastic accuracy.\n\n\"His understanding of the game is good. All the defensive responsibilities we've asked of him, it's not necessarily been where he's played for many years but he's been really diligent and open to wanting to take that on board.\n\n\"We know it's a work in progress. We know it's something that's going to get a lot of attention as it's not been the norm. But we feel it's something that can add to what we've got.\"\n\nSouthgate also stressed that England will be facing a much tougher test and warned that they will need to deliver a more complete performance to win. The England boss added: \"Denmark are a good side. Not only in the Euros but the two games in the Nations League were very tough matches for us. We are very aware of that.\n\n\"We know there were elements of our game we were really pleased with the other day and elements that have to be better. To play against a team of Denmark's quality all those aspects have to come together to get the win.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

There's a lot of hard work ahead,\" he added.\n\nDenmark can exact some revenge against England, which edged it 2-1 in the semifinals of the 2020 European Championship.\n\nThe Danes drew 1-1 with Slovenia in their opener on Saturday, an afternoon flushed with emotion at the return to the Euros of midfielder Christian Eriksen. Three years after he suffered a cardiac arrest during play at the last tournament, Eriksen scored the Danes' lone goal.\n\nHe was the only Danish player to maintain his level throughout the game, however, and they conceded an equalizer in a disappointing result.\n\nDenmark has tasted glory on the international stage, winning the 1992 European Championship -- an accomplishment that has eluded England in its 10 previous appearances.

without conceding a goal, stretching back to the 2016 game against Wales.\n\nEngland had to fend off an attacking Serbia in the second half on Saturday, and Southgate saw the positives of his patched-up back line being tested.\n\n\"I'm pleased that we had to show a different side, we had to show that resilience to defend our box because I think as a group that really builds a huge spirit,\" Southgate said.\n\nIn Southgate's debrief, he will have undoubtedly looked at the lack of production from defender Kieran Tripper and midfielder Phil Foden on the left side, particularly after Foden's breakout season with Manchester City.\n\nEngland was fortunate to open the tournament with a victory, but it did not entirely feel like one -- it has the chance to ramp up the feelgood

looked really unbalanced, especially in midfield where Declan Rice and Trent Alexander-Arnold really struggled, whilst the attack, particularly Harry Kane, looked off it.\n\nThat level of performance is not what's expected with a team that possesses so much quality and Southgate acknowledged England have to find another level.\n\n\"Clearly not what we would have hoped [for],\" he told BBC

It's the vision of the manager [Southgate].\n\n'England will take a 1-0 lead, then he [Southgate] decides to start gambling with making his team compact and relying on moments for the remaining minutes of the game.'\n\nGiven Ten Hag's tactical approach repeatedly came under fire last term, as United endured their worst ever season in the Premier League, Richards was taken aback by the Dutchman's comments attacking Southgate.\n\nCoincidentally, Southgate was one of the names heavily linked with the Old Trafford job before United bosses opted to keep the faith with Ten Hag following a lengthy post-season review.\n\n'Glass houses, to start with,' the ex-Manchester City and England defender said on The Rest Is Football podcast.\n\n'We basically had this conversational in the FA Cup final and now he's being a pundit talking about how managers are playing in a negative fashion.\n\n'When we talk about Man United and they've not had a good season because of where they've finished in the league, he bites at us!\n\n'It's ridiculous! We've backed him so many times, saying the way he's been treated has not been great and now he's talking about other managers, it's a lack of respect. It's a lack of respect.'\n\nAlan Shearer criticised England's unconvincing display but was glad to have emerged with maximum points from Sunday's cagey affair, considering the Three Lions' dismal record in the opening games of European Championships.\n\n'I was surprised in the second half how far we went back,' the former England and Newcastle striker said.\n\n'It wouldn't have surprised me for 10 or 15 minutes because it's international football and at times you're going to have to suffer out of possession, you're going to have to defend well, you might need your goalkeeper, you might need a bit of luck.\n\n'But I thought we were really poor. We lacked energy, we lacked spark.\n\n'We lacked a little bit of know-how as well because you've got to play the game a little bit. When we were getting free-kicks we were trying to take quick free-kicks and I'm thinking: \"Hang on, f***inghell! Just kill the game! We're under huge pressure here. We're winning 1-0, keep the ball frustrate them\".\n\n'It was really poor I thought in the second half, but it's an opening game of a European Championships and England notoriously have s*** records in opening games. Before yesterday, we won one in the last ten.'\n\nMORE : Juventus halt Mason Greenwood transfer and target \u00a340m Manchester United star instead\n\nMORE : Why is there no 2pm Euro 2024 game

However, Southgate seems incapable of recognising this.\n\nHis senseless selections continued elsewhere on the pitch as Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold was handed another chance to show why he is not a midfielder.\n\nEngland's supposed 'best passer' is not up to the job of playing in the centre of the park, particularly when it comes to controlling the game.\n\nFormer Newcastle star Alan Shearer pinpointed the issue as co-commentator on the BBC, imploring Southgate to introduce someone more adept at running proceedings.\n\nA few minutes after Shearer's comment, Southgate replaced Alexander-Arnold with Conor Gallagher. The Chelsea midfielder is a willing worker, but controlling the tempo is not one of his strengths.\n\nWhile Gallagher ran around like a headless chicken, the answer to England's control problems was eagerly hoping Southgate would remember he had included him in the squad.\n\nAdam Wharton has made a rapid rise up the ranks over the past couple of years. He made his mark with Blackburn Rovers in the Championship before signing for Palace in January.\n\nHe immediately looked at home in the Premier League and was superb on his England debut in a friendly against Bosnia & Herzegovina.\n\nWharton's doubters claim he lacks the experience to play in a major tournament, but that viewpoint ignores the fact that he is a generational talent.\n\nIf England are to have any chance of winning Euro 2024, Southgate needs to stop shoehorning players into unfavourable positions.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

And that's how a young Southgate got the nickname 'Nord' from his Crystal Palace teammates, due to the similarity in the way the pair spoke and their shared love of grey Hush Puppies.\n\nSouthgate's Euro 96 penalty miss was unfortunately one of the defining moments of his playing career, but he was at least able to make fun of himself, when he starred in a Pizza Hut advert alongside Stuart Pearce and Chris Waddle, who had missed spot kicks in England's Italia 90 shootout defeat to West Germany.\n\nTalking of that Euro 96 penalty, he proved the rule that mothers are always right. Years later, Southgate told the Guardian that his mum's reaction to the miss came in the form of a simple question: \"Why didn't you just blast it, dear?\"\n\nWe won't dwell on the penalty miss much longer, but Southgate was even the victim of a ribbing from a Buddhist monk on the other side of the world after he saw his effort saved. Southgate and his wife Alison flew away on their honeymoon in 1997 and ran into a monk, who instead of imparting the couple with some mystic philosophy, he said: \"It's you, it's you, isn't it? England. Penalty miss.\"\n\nIn a summer-time version of the Whamageddon game at Christmas, Southgate found that he couldn't face listening to Three Lions for 20 years following Euro 96.\n\n\"Football's coming home, I couldn't listen to it for 20 years, frankly,\" he told Sky News. \"It has a slightly different feel for me, but it's nice to hear people enjoying it again.\n\n\"I would just walk out of the room. It is an anthem and has followed the team for a long time, but involved some difficult moments as well. I don't stick it on, it's not on the playlist, but I can listen to it now.\"\n\n\"That ended in disappointment and it is nice to be able to put a different frame on it now.\"\n\nTo make it as a professional footballer you have to learn how to deal with adversity and knockbacks. Thankfully, a 16-year-old Southgate did just that, as he refused to take the advice of his first Crystal Palace manager Alan Smith, who questioned the youngster over his life choices after he spotted him shaking hands with the opposition and thanking them after losing to a British Army XI.\n\n\"Gareth look, if I was you I'd become a travel agent because I don't think football's going to be for you, if you go on like this,\" Smith recalls telling him. Thankfully, the young prospect took this advice on board.\n\nAston Villa have had plenty of England internationals turn out for them, but no Villan has won more England caps while at the club than Southgate. The centre-back turned out 42 times for the Three Lions during his time at Villa Park, ahead of the likes of Gareth Barry, David Platt, Darius Vassell and Jack Grealish.\n\nSouthgate initially turned down the chance to be England's caretaker manager in 2016. His former Palace boss Smith picks up the story: \"I don't think he was convinced, the way that the job was being put to him... on a short term contract, on a salary that wasn't conducive with being the England manager Gareth knows his worth. He's no fool.\"\n\nWhether you're the kind to thank Southgate for reuniting 2000s girl group Atomic Kitten or not is up to you, but the trio's original line-up reunited for the first time in ten years to record a version of their 2001 single 'Whole Again' after terrace fans had adapted the original lyrics to make it about the England boss.\n\nYou know how it goes: \"Southgate, you're the one - you still turn me on, football's coming home again.\"\n\nSouthgate's journey as England manager also inspired a hit West End play. Titled Dear England' after an open letter that Southgate wrote to England fans during the COVID-19 pandemic, the play begins with a Euro 96 flashback before running through the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, plus Euro 2020.\n\nFourFourTwo went along and enjoyed it.

The players as a collective recognise that now after the last couple of days.\n\n'We talked with them about it. It's very rare at their club they'd win a game and experience what they've experienced over the last couple of days.\n\n'I have to make sure I can guide them through that, let them understand it and recognise it's the reality of our world but that we shouldn't be thrown off track by it. We're in a good position, we know we want to play better, there are a lot of things we did really well and we move towards tomorrow's game.'\n\n12 of his 26 strong squad are at their first major tournament and need this education and can count of the lessons learnt by the more experienced members of the team.\n\nThis includes vice-captain Kyle Walker, who revealed a bit more of what was said in the meeting: 'He had a brief talk with us last night, and normally there are 20 other Premier League teams to write about and fill columns about.\n\n'Now all eyes are on us boys over here representing our country and we are all coming together as one.\n\n'So obviously there is going to be a massive scrutiny in certain performances or certain things we do, but I think we cannot take away that we came away from there with three points on the board, a clean sheet and in a good stead for this game against Denmark.\n\n'I don't look at anything. Because I feel I'm in here and this is the only little bubble. I feel when you concentrate not on two games or three games time but just one game at a time, I feel that's when you get the best out of each other.\n\n'When you start listening to outside noise, or good press and bad press, it affects different people in different ways.\n\n'If you were to write good things or bad things about me, if I don't read it I don't react and don't change my opinion on what I'm going to approach a game like. I approach a game as a team game, I approach a game to go and win the game at all costs, and that's all I care about really.'\n\nMORE : Paul Merson baffled by Scott McTominay tactic in Scotland draw with Switzerland\n\nMORE : Kieran Tierney injury update after Scotland star is stretchered off in Euro 2024 draw with Switzerland", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "callum_mcavoy@metro.co.uk", "name": "Callum McAvoy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Tierney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Tierney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Merson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Merson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McTominay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott McTominay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2158298926.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C12px%2C1024px%2C538px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658686", "eventUri": "eng-9658686", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

But it was no less than they deserved.\n\nBoos met the full time whistle and no little anger fell down from the stands. For their part, the Danish fans cheered and had a little on-field celebration with their side.\n\nHere are six talking points from Frankfurt.\n\n1. Southgate sticks\n\nQuestions had to be answered by the England boss.\n\nWould he stick with Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield? Would Kieran Trippier continue at left back? Would Phil Foden drop out or switch position after the opener?\n\nEverybody, players, pundits, fans, journalists, everyone, had their own ideas on what should happen. But one thing that has tied Southgate to his players down the years has been loyalty.\n\nAnd after winning against Serbia, he stayed loyal to his players here.\n\n2. Great stadium, dismal pitch\n\nKyle Walker was very lucky early doors.\n\nTwice the surface cut up below his feet, and on the second occasion his ankle turned horribly. Fortunately his foot wasn't planted, otherwise it could have been extremely nasty. Walker hobbled off and promptly changed boots\n\nBut Marc Guehi experienced similar, as did Bukayo Saka and Jude Bellingham. A number of the Danes lost their footing too.\n\nThe pitch cut up horribly and given how brilliant the Frankfurt Stadium is, it's a real shame that its pitch isn't seemingly of a similar quality.\n\n3. Did Erik ten Hag have a point?\n\nThe Manchester United boss had some choice comments with regards Southgate and his England side during and after the win over Serbia.\n\nIt was basically, 'they score then they sit back'.\n\nAnd I'm not saying that's what they tried to do here, because I just happen to think they were playing poorly and the midfield wasn't working, and that's why Denmark took the upper hand more, rather than them choosing to play on the counter.\n\nBut it's a question that has often been levelled at Southgate. Is he too passive? Does he, intentionally or not, make his team that way?\n\nUntil we start seeing England get in front and then simultaneously dominate/go for the throat of an opponent, it's not going to go away.\n\n4. The Trent experiment\n\nThe 54 minutes here before the Liverpool man was hooked for Conor Gallagher were enough. Southgate's experiment at shoe-horning him into the starting lineup alongside Declan Rice and seeing how it works was good in theory, but in practice, it's not going to help England win this tournament.\n\nThere are other ways to get Alexander-Arnold into this side. Revert to a back three and play him as your right wing-back, with Walker behind. Or drop Walker, if that's what is preferred (it isn't).\n\nBut there's a reason we've never seen him handed this central midfield platform by Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool. The footwork isn't there. The extra nous that comes with regularly being in there is missing.\n\nIt's one thing wondering in as an inverted full-back, entering space and being the spare man when you create overloads. It's another thing to already be in there and have everything flying around you.\n\nIf Southgate wants to win the European Championship, he needs to row back on Plan A. Alexander-Arnold is an outstanding footballer, with gifts 99.9 percent of players dream to have. But it doesn't work.\n\n5. Great Guehi\n\nThe Crystal Palace centre-back was excellent against Serbia. He was even better here.\n\nThere was a real authority about his performance and intelligence. Sometimes he stood off, sometimes he went in tight or nicked in front. Sometimes he used subtlety. Sometimes he used brute strength.\n\nThroughout, he barely put a foot wrong, until seven minutes from time Declan Rice's pass was short, he tried to turn out of trouble and got caught. Thankfully, he's blessed with great recovery pace, and got back to make the tackle.\n\nAll in, it was another really impressive showing, proving why Southgate was right to make him the man to replace Harry Maguire.\n\n6. That substitution\n\nWith just over 20 minutes remaining, Southgate twisted. And my word, how he twisted.\n\nKane, Foden and Saka all hooked. Together.\n\nIn truth, none could really have any complaints. Saka didn't have the best of games, Foden hit the post with a fine effort but it was another match where he skirted round the fringes rather than taking charge of it.\n\nAnd Kane? I'd be astonished if that back injury he played through at Bayern Munich isn't still causing him grief. Yes he scored, but his movement looks hampered.\n\nIt wasn't working. So credit the manager for making the decision to make a change and try to be assertive. Eberechi Eze, Jarrod Bowen and Ollie Watkins have all had outstanding seasons at their respective clubs, and Watkins movement in behind did at least stretch the Danes.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

But one thing that has tied Southgate to his players down the years has been loyalty.\n\nAnd after winning against Serbia, he stayed loyal to his players here.\n\n2. Great stadium, dismal pitch\n\nKyle Walker was very lucky early doors.\n\nTwice the surface cut up below his feet, and on the second occasion his ankle turned horribly. Fortunately his foot wasn't planted, otherwise it could have been extremely nasty. Walker hobbled off and promptly changed boots\n\nBut Marc Guehi experienced similar, as did Saka and Jude Bellingham. A number of the Danes lost their footing too.\n\nThe pitch cut up horribly and given how brilliant the Frankfurt Stadium is, it's a real shame that its pitch isn't seemingly of a similar quality.\n\n3. Did Erik ten Hag have a point?\n\nThe Manchester United boss had some choice comments with regards Southgate and his England side during and after the win over Serbia.\n\nIt was basically, 'they score then they sit back'.\n\nAnd I'm not saying that's what they tried to do here, because I just happen to think they were playing poorly and the midfield wasn't working, and that's why Denmark took the upper hand more, rather than them choosing to play on the counter.\n\nBut it's a question that has often been levelled at Southgate. Is he too passive? Does he, intentionally or not, make his team that way?\n\nUntil we start seeing England get in front and then simultaneously dominate/go for the throat of an opponent, it's not going to go away.\n\n4. The Trent experiment\n\nThe 54 minutes here before the Liverpool man was hooked for Conor Gallagher were enough. Southgate's experiment at shoe-horning him into the starting lineup alongside Declan Rice and seeing how it works was good in theory, but in practice, it's not going to help England win this tournament.\n\nThere are other ways to get Alexander-Arnold into this side. Revert to a back three and play him as your right wing-back, with Walker behind. Or drop Walker, if that's what is preferred (it isn't).\n\nBut there's a reason we've never seen him handed this central midfield platform by Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool. The footwork isn't there. The extra nous that comes with regularly being in there is missing.\n\nIt's one thing wondering in as an inverted full-back, entering space and being the spare man when you create overloads. It's another thing to already be in there and have everything flying around you.\n\nIf Southgate wants to win the European Championship, he needs to row back on Plan A. Alexander-Arnold is an outstanding footballer, with gifts 99.9 percent of players dream to have. But it doesn't work.\n\n5. Great Guehi\n\nThe Crystal Palace centre-back was excellent against Serbia. He was even better here.\n\nThere was a real authority about his performance and intelligence. Sometimes he stood off, sometimes he went in tight or nicked in front. Sometimes he used subtlety. Sometimes he used brute strength.\n\nThroughout, he barely put a foot wrong, until seven minutes from time Declan Rice's pass was short, he tried to turn out of trouble and got caught. Thankfully, he's blessed with great recovery pace, and got back to make the tackle.\n\nAll in, it was another really impressive showing, proving why Southgate was right to make him the man to replace Harry Maguire.\n\n6. That substitution\n\nWith just over 20 minutes remaining, Southgate twisted. And my word, how he twisted.\n\nKane, Foden and Saka all hooked. Together.\n\nIn truth, none could really have any complaints. Saka didn't have the best of games, Foden hit the post with a fine effort but it was another match where he skirted round the fringes rather than taking charge of it.\n\nAnd Kane? I'd be astonished if that back injury he played through at Bayern Munich isn't still causing him grief. Yes he scored, but his movement looks hampered.\n\nIt wasn't working. So credit the manager for making the decision to make a change and try to be assertive. Eberechi Eze, Jarrod Bowen and Ollie Watkins have all had outstanding seasons at their respective clubs, and Watkins movement in behind did at least stretch the Danes.\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

England must prove they've got theirs out the way early", "body": "Having watched Germany embarrass Scotland on opening night, then Spain pick apart a decent opponent in Croatia in good style, there could be no denying that England's 1-0 victory over Serbia -- solid result though it was -- felt a little underwhelming.\n\nContext, though, has been kinder to Gareth Southgate in the days since, and his reminders about both the awkwardness and importance of the first group match of any tournament feel more vindicated now that Belgium have been beaten and Portugal and France made to work hard for their own opening victories, also by just a single goal.\n\n\"Today it's not about assessing this game from the technical or tactical point of view,\" said Portugal boss Roberto Martinez, after his team came from behind to beat Czech Republic 2-1 on Tuesday, an instruction that, assuming the Portuguese media and fanbase are anything like ours, will have fallen on deaf ears.\n\nThe question ahead of today's Group C meeting with Denmark here in Frankfurt, then, is of where England's campaign goes next.\n\nIt has been a theme of the past two tournaments under Southgate, and indeed many of those long before he took charge, that even in the course of relatively serene qualifications England tend to throw in a bit of a stinker somewhere to temper the mood.\n\nIt happened at the World Cup in Qatar, where a 6-2 thrashing of Iran sent expectations soaring ahead of the prime Friday-night clash with the USA, only for that game to... well, actually, can anyone remember anything about it at all?\n\nIt happened in similar circumstances during the last Euros, too, when the much-hyped Scotland derby finished goalless at Wembley in the pouring rain.\n\nSo, what have England done here? Got their off-night out of the way early and snuck away from it with three points as well? If so, they are tracking nicely, given the opening half-hour against Serbia featured more craft, more up-tempo passing, than in 180 minutes against the Scots and Americans combined.\n\nOr will that second-game syndrome strike again this evening, against a Danish side hunting revenge for their semi-final defeat three years ago? If it does, the levels of scrutiny and dissection in the Serbia aftermath will soon feel quaint.\n\nSouthgate has spoken to his players this week about dealing with the forensic, individual analysis that inevitably comes with each England performance, though it is worth noting that it runs in terms of both the rough and the smooth.\n\nTrue, Phil Foden will have had quieter games in a Manchester City shirt without sparking a noisy referendum on his best use, but Marc Guehi will also have played better for Crystal Palace without drawing anything like this week's praise.\n\n\"There's going to be a narrative about a player, a couple of players, after every England game,\" said Southgate, whose squad includes a dozen tournament rookies.\n\n\"This is a different world to the one you experience at clubs. It's very rare at their club that they'd win a game and experience what they've experienced here over the last couple of days.\"\n\nThose narratives move quickly at major tournament, not only out of amplified enthusiasm, interest and jeopardy, but also because they must. Conclusions probably should not be drawn after one match, but pretty much have to be after two.\n\nIf something -- Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield, for instance -- does not quite convince on opening night, then it is almost always worth a second look. But with the perils of the knockout stage (or worse) looming, it takes a brave manager to sanction a third. This meeting with the Danes, then, will serve to confirm or dismiss the opinions formed hastily across this tournament's first week, with little time or space for a great deal in between.\n\nThe exception is at left-back, where frustratingly for Southgate, nothing can change: Luke Shaw remains unfit and, while the lack of a left-footer is clearly harming England's build-up play, Kieran Trippier is the obvious next-best.\n\nAfter the relative unknown of Serbia, who England had never played at senior level previously, Kasper Hjulmand's side ought to offer a more predictable yardstick against which Southgate might measure his. In the semi-final of Euro 2020, there was nothing between the teams in 90 minutes, and only the converted rebound of a controversially awarded, then saved, Harry Kane penalty to split them after extra-time.\n\n\"Losing a semi-final when we were so close and it was minor details that decided it, it took me a while to digest it,\" Hjulmand said here yesterday. \"I carried it for a while. That kind of game also gives you motivation.\"\n\nEngland need little extra, knowing that a second win in five days will guarantee their last-16 place with a game to spare, and possibly even wrap up top spot in the group.\n\nJust as much, though, they need something a little more convincing, to leave their second-game syndrome behind.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

It's a season or a tournament that defines a player. Especially with Phil coming off the back of the season he had, I don't think one 90 minutes should be scrutinised as much as I'm being told it is.\n\n\"Phil is a great character, he's had, I wouldn't say a difficult path to get here, as he's won a lot of trophies at Manchester City, but he's had to be patient.\n\n\"This is just another little thing he has to overcome when there is so much pressure on him now after such a great season, that big players have to rise up on big occasions.\"\n\nFoden will again be supported from left-back by the right-footed Kieran Trippier, with Luke Shaw on Wednesday training individually and not available to face the Danes as he continues to work his way back from a hamstring injury.\n\n\"Luke is progressing as we thought he would,\" Southgate said. \"Realistically, we are looking to the back end of this week and early next, and we are not unhappy with that progress at all. We are still positive he can make a contribution as we move forward.\"\n\nSouthgate acknowledged that Foden missed the \"balance\" and \"drive\" provided by Shaw, the only recognised left-back in the squad, but believes Trippier brings other qualities to the role.\n\n\"The balance [Shaw] gives, the drive he gives, whoever plays with him down that side of the pitch, he gives a different outlet,\" the manager said.\n\n\"But if you talk to wingers that play with [Trippier], his communication is an enormous help to other players. He has different attributes that Luke doesn't have.\"\n\nAsked about Foden's display against the Serbs, Southgate added: \"I thought Phil did an exceptional job for us on Sunday.\n\n\"Other players grabbed the attention, but the way he worked for the team, defended the spaces, real intelligence in how he played. Towards the end of the game he retained the ball for us in really crucial moments.\n\n\"He had a half-chance in the first couple of minutes where a slightly better touch and a shot away on goal we could be talking about something very different.\n\n\"He linked the game well in that opening period with the others.

We were hoping a couple of days ago he might accelerate that bit but he needs a bit more volume work.\n\n\"He didn't train with group [on Wednesday] because there are days when he needs to do more than the rest of the group and days when he needs to recover when the others are pushing. He is still in and out from the others but operating on his own programme as well.\"\n\nShaw hasn't been available for selection since February since picking up a muscle injury in United's win over Luton Town in the Premier League.\n\nRed Devils boss Erik ten Hag warned fans ahead of time that Shaw may not be available for any group stage games, instead saying that he will play in the round of 16 for England.\n\nWith Shaw still absent from the squad, Southgate is likely to turn to Trippier to cover the left side of defence once again. The Magpies defender is usually stationed on the right, but has previously confirmed his willingness to cover either side.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luton_Town_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luton Town F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/War_and_Politics", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/War and Politics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/D86S.iEDlCM1clJxZbJQwA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/90min_articles_646/4e86be331a84d9cf7c2bae0f7e55a220", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658686", "eventUri": "eng-9658686", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

FourFourTwo take a look at a few key areas Gareth Southgate will need to address ahead of his side's final group game against Slovenia on Tuesday.\n\nVIDEO Alan Shearer Explains How England Could Have Won The Euros\n\nWe momentarily saw Kane at his best in the otherwise drab Denmark clash on Thursday evening, instinctively poaching a goal in and around the six-yard box after being denied by the fingertips of Serbia's Predrag Rajkovic in the previous game.\n\nDespite that, it still feels like Southgate is yet to find a way to get his captain on the ball or consistently supply him with chances. In both games, the talisman has barely topped 20 touches, only two of which were inside the opposition box across the 180 minutes of football.\n\nThere is no debate on how deadly Kane is inside the penalty area. England need to find a way to get him there more often.\n\nPlayer for player, there is little question that England have one of the best squads in the competition.\n\nIf you were really searching for a weakness, the defensive unit would likely be your first port of call, with Marc Guehi relatively inexperienced at the international level and right-back Kieran Trippier filling in on the opposite flank.\n\nDespite that, in both of England's opening games, they have taken the lead early on and immediately retreated to their own half for the remainder, resting heavily on the weakest area of the pitch.\n\nGame management is key to tournament football, but the Three Lions need to stop taking their foot off the gas after a single goal. There is bags of attacking potential in this attacking unit; Southgate needs to find a way to use it.\n\nTwo games have passed, both with Phil Foden primarily out on the left-wing, and we're still yet to see the best of the Premier League's Player of the Season.\n\nThe 24-year-old showed exactly what he can do more centrally just shy of the hour mark, receiving the ball from Bukayo Saka and rapidly finding a shooting angle from outside the box, denied only by the post.\n\nHe has been shifted out wide to accommodate Jude Bellingham but the Real Madrid man is more than capable of playing deeper, as shown regularly for his former side Borussia Dortmund.\n\nUtilising that side of Bellingham's game would free up the no.10 role for Foden, leaving Southgate free to choose from the likes of Anthony Gordon and Eberechi Eze to pick up the slack on the left side.\n\nThis is how to watch Euro 2024 live streams from anywhere in the world, while we have a guide on how to get Euro 2024 tickets if you're still looking to go to the tournament. We have the run-down on Euro 2024 stadiums, with info on host cities, capacities, and everything you need to know.\n\nWe have a list of the Euro 2024 favourites, with best odds on nations to win European Championship in Germany, while these are the best Euros games ever and these are the best pundits ever.

Harry Kane gave England a dream start when he fired home in the 18th minute. It was Kane's 13th tournament goal - a record for an Englishman.\n\nBut the captain was at fault in the 39th minute when his poor clearance led to Morten Hjulmand blasting Denmark level from 30 yards. Southgate admitted: \"The team didn't function today - and that's my responsibility. I'm in control and I have to find solutions.\n\n\"The players are giving everything. If anything, they care too much. We can't make excuses. We have to accept responsibility. We didn't pass the ball with any intensity and we conceded possession too easily.\n\n\"That led to an anxious performance and we have to be better if we want to progress to the latter stages, like everyone is expecting. Our press wasn't intense enough and that gave us a problem. We have got to find a way of being more compact than we have in the last three halves of football.\n\n\"These boys aren't lacking effort but we need to find more quality. We are disappointed with the performance levels in the first two games and now we've got to analyse them in depth and address the issues we have.\"\n\nSouthgate substituted Trent Alexander-Arnold and attacking trio Kane, Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka in a bid to turn the tide of the game. More than 20,000 England fans were in the Frankfurt Arena - and they made their anger clear towards the end of the game.\n\nAfter walking across the pitch to thank the Three Lions support for their backing, Southgate suggested the tournament favourites are struggling to cope with expectation levels. He said: \"We need the fans and I will always face them. I have to say they've been brilliant in the stadiums and I can completely understand their frustration with the way that we played.\n\n\"We have to accept the environment that we're in and the expectations that are around us - and we have to walk towards that challenge. To achieve extraordinary things, you have to go through some difficult moments. Today was a difficult moment without a doubt, towards the end of the game especially.\n\n\"We understand what that will mean for the next few days, but we have to stay calm inside the group and find good solutions to improve it.\" Danish coach Kasper Hjulmand said: \"I can't say we are disappointed but it's a shame because there was a result out there that we could have got.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The aim is to ensure they are further focussed for the game in Frankfurt against Denmark.\n\n\"There's going to be a narrative around a player, a couple of players, after every England game,\" Southgate said. \"This is a different world to the one you experience at clubs. The players as a collective recognise that now after the last couple of days. We talked with them about it. It's very rare at their club they'd win a game and experience what they've experienced over the last couple of days.\n\n\"I have to make sure I can guide them through that, let them understand it and recognise it's the reality of our world but that we shouldn't be thrown off track by it. We're in a good position, we know we want to play better, there are a lot of things we did really well and we move towards tomorrow's game. \"\n\nA senior player in Kyle Walker exemplified the approach that Southgate spoke about, as he freely spoke of how he pays no attention to any discussion around a tournament.\n\n\"He had a brief talk with us last night, and normally there are 20 other Premier League teams to write about and fill columns about. Now all eyes are on us boys over here representing our country and we are all coming together as one.\n\n\"So obviously there is going to be a massive scrutiny in certain performances or certain things we do, but I think we cannot take away that we came away from there with three points on the board, a clean sheet and in a good stead for this game against Denmark.\n\n\"I don't look at anything. Because I feel I'm in here and this is the only little bubble. I feel when you concentrate not on two games or three games time but just one game at a time, I feel that's when you get the best out of each other. When you start listening to outside noise, or good press and bad press, it affects different people in different ways.\n\n\"If you were to write good things or bad things about me, if I don't read it I don't react and don't change my opinion on what I'm going to approach a game like.\n\n\"I approach a game as a team game, I approach a game to go and win the game at all costs, and that's all I care about really.\"\n\nWalker did joke with media afterwards, stating: \"Cheers lads. Keep writing though. Keep writing - I just don't read it. But you're doing well.\"\n\nOn a different note, Southgate expressed his appreciation for Denmark's Christian Eriksen. The Manchester United midfielder scored in his side's own opening 1-1 draw against Slovenia, three years after suffering cardiac arrest in a match against Iceland in Euro 2020.\n\n\"He is a top quality player and he is probably going to be playing a little bit higher than the types of players that dictate the whole tempo of a game but you know that the quality of his passing, his ability to score goals, the quality of his set plays is exceptional, absolutely exceptional. It is a real strength for Denmark. He is a player I have huge admiration for.\n\n\"Of course, on a human level, I am delighted to see him back playing. We were watching that game three years ago and it is really heart-warming to see him come back and score. It was almost written but it is only written if you have the mentality and the desire to get back and play and play at the level he has.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Eriksen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Eriksen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardiac arrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/19/19/newFile.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658686", "eventUri": "eng-9658686", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

It's very rare at their club they'd win a game and experience what they've experienced over the last couple of days.\n\n\"I have to make sure I can guide them through that, let them understand it and recognise it's the reality of our world, but that we shouldn't be thrown off track by it. We're in a good position, we know we want to play better, there are lot of things we did really well and we move towards tomorrow's game.\"\n\nKyle Walker, England's oldest player in Germany, understands the focus on the players' performances but says he pays no attention to the outside noise.\n\n\"He [Southgate] had a brief talk with us last night,\" Walker, 34, said on Wednesday.\n\n\"[He said] normally there are 20 other Premier League teams to write about and fill columns about. Now all eyes are on us boys over here representing our country and we are all coming together as one.\n\n\"So obviously there is going to be massive scrutiny in certain performances or certain things we do, but I think we cannot take away that we came away from there with three points on the board, a clean sheet and in a good stead for this game against Denmark.\n\n\"I very rarely read the media and what things are said, I concentrate on what's in this camp: what the manager says and what the people around me and teammates are saying.\n\n\"When we get that scrutiny we have to take it as a positive because people expect so much of us.\n\n\"We know with the quality we have in the dressing room that we can go and score three or four in games but in tournament football it's about winning the game and move on, really.\n\n\"If you were to write good things or bad things about me, if I don't read it, I don't react and don't change my opinion on what I'm going to approach a game like.\n\n\"I approach a game as a team game, I approach a game to go and win the game at all costs, and that's all I care about really.\n\n\"I don't have [social media], I don't look at anything. Because I feel I'm in here and this is the only little bubble. I feel when you concentrate not on two games or three games time but just one game at a time, I feel that's when you get the best out of each other.\n\n\"When you start listening to outside noise, or good press and bad press, it affects different people in different ways.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southgate,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/499e81d754a33c2ff8c8b8289c6abea1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658686", "eventUri": "eng-9658686", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Every coach would reflect on that.\n\n\"I was really pleased with Gallagher, Kobbie, Bowen when they came on, I felt they all contributed really well to the team.

However, the Football Association did not make a complaint and the investigation has been driven purely by UEFA who have also charged Serbia with displaying an inflammatory Kosovo flag.\n\nWhen asked whether the FA or the players had heard anything, England boss Southgate said: \"No, we're the same.

including England boss, Gareth Southgate.\n\nSouthgate was believed to be favoured by INEOS who have a strong personal relationship with the former Premier League defender.\n\nHowever, the prospect of Southgate swapping the Three Lions for the Red Devils wasn't met positively by the Old Trafford faithful.\n\nSupporters seem universal in their lack of enthusiasm toward the former Middlesbrough coach, something backed up by a group at a fans' dinner.\n\nAs reported by The Athletic, a United legend attended the dinner and asked for a show of hands on who would be happy with the appointment of Southgate.\n\nThe results were emphatic with not one person from the floor raising their hand in support of the 53-year-old.\n\nThe club legend was reportedly \"taken back\" by the response and said he'd make sure the powers at be at United were made aware of the consensus.\n\nWhether fan backlash played a part in United's final decision or not, Ten Hag has been granted a third season in Manchester and will be desperate to get off to a good start in the new campaign.\n\nUnited have the perfect opportunity to do just that with Fulham visiting the Theatre of Dreams on the opening day of

The left-back was named among the substitutes for Sunday's 1-0 win over Serbia but will be absent from the bench in Frankfurt.\n\nSouthgate has stated that he does not want to put a timeframe on the Man United star's return as his selection continues to baffle some England fans\n\nSpeaking about Shaw, Southgate has said via the Daily Mail: \"Luke won't be involved, no. He's actually on track for where we thought he would be originally. We were hoping a couple of days ago we might accelerate that a little bit, but he needs a bit more volume work.\n\n\"He didn't train with the rest of the group today, because there are days when he needs to do more than the rest of the group.\n\n\"There are days when he needs to recover when the others are pushing, so he's still in and out with the others and operating on his own programme as well. We don't want to put a timeline on it at this moment, but he is progressing well.\"\n\nThe decision to take Shaw to Euro 2024 has been a very strange one from Southgate as the left-back is clearly not fit and even if he does return, the defender has not played since February.\n\nLeft-back has been an issue for England recently and the Three Lions boss could have taken someone else to relieve some of the pressure placed on Kieran Trippier.\n\nChelsea's Ben Chilwell has not had a good season at Stamford Bridge but the Blues star would have still been a better option than a half-fit Shaw. The Man United star's selection has been a waste of a player selection and only time will tell if it somehow pays off for Southgate and England.", "source": {"uri": "caughtoffside.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CaughtOffside"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darren_looney@caughtoffside.com", "name": "Darren Looney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stamford Bridge (stadium)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Chilwell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Chilwell"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://icdn.caughtoffside.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Gareth-Southgate-England.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658686", "eventUri": "eng-9658686", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

masters", "body": "If there is a concern for Gareth Southgate after the first round of matches at Euro 2024, it might be a tediously familiar one.\n\nWatching Germany metronome Toni Kroos, Spain pair Rodri and Pedri and France's N'Golo Kante continue to run games, it remains easy to wonder if England will struggle for midfield control at the business end of the tournament, particularly after their patchy second half against Serbia.\n\nSouthgate has acknowledged that England do not have a player such as Kroos or Croatia's Luka Modric, able \"to control the rhythm of a game\", and the manager is instead playing to his squad's strengths by building a team full of energy, vision and explosive power, with Trent Alexander-Arnold expected to continue next to Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham against Denmark here in Frankfurt on Thursday afternoon.\n\nLike Serbia, the Danes are set to use a back-five out of possession and Southgate believes Alexander-Arnold can unlock packed defences.\n\n\"He's less likely to be a player who dictates tempo,\" the manager said. \"What I do see is that range of passing and that ability to open up a defence that might be blocking spaces, defending low.\"\n\nThe tempo-setting, possession-keeping element is still necessary, however, and Denmark have the personnel to test England's ability to control a game for 90 minutes.\n\nPremier League pair Christian Eriksen and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg are likely to be joined by Sporting Lisbon's Morten Hjulmand in a ponderous but technical midfield three.\n\nEriksen is already one of the stories of the Championship after capping an excellent performance with the opening goal in Denmark's 1-1 draw with Slovenia, his first Euros appearance since suffering a cardiac arrest on the pitch in their opening game against Finland three years ago.\n\n\"It's heart-warming to see him come back and score,\" Southgate said. \"It was almost written, but it is only written if you have the mentality and the desire to get back and play at the level he has.\"\n\nEriksen, 32, is not quite the player who was puppet-master for Tottenham, but his display in Stuttgart suggests he is still his country's difference-maker, and may simply be another casualty of the chronic dysfunction at Manchester United.\n\n\"You know that the quality of his passing, his ability to score goals, the quality of his set-plays is exceptional, absolutely exceptional,\" Southgate said.\n\nLike Eriksen, Hojbjerg spent most of last season on the bench, for Spurs, but he has a good range of passing and can look after the ball when required. \u00adHjulmand is a hard-working enforcer, comfortable in possession.\n\nDenmark faded against Slovenia and were susceptible to the counter-punch, but they were composed in possession, completing 590 passes -- more than England managed on Sunday -- and will take encouragement from the way Serbia forced Southgate's side onto the back foot.\n\nSouthgate has acknowledged that England's new-look midfield remains a \"work in progress\", and if they are to compete with the technical masters of Germany, Spain, France and Portugal in the knockouts, they must prove they can control the game against a team that wants to have the ball.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Fantastic.\n\n\"But when you've got the availability of players and talent pool you've got, a domestic league that is the powerhouse in Europe, and an attitude in English football that somewhere along the line you are going to want to win tournaments.\n\n\"You get to a point where the coach has to be under some degree of expectation and expectation of pressure. Most nations when they built up, like France and Spain, they won youth tournaments, started to become more competitive in senior tournaments and then went on to win. It has to be a natural progression.\"\n\nDespite admitting praise for Southgate's management of the media and his care of his players, Jordan insisted the England boss had much left to prove.\n\n\"On the field, I do think he has to be judged in this tournament,\" he said. \"There are some factors...the landscape has slightly shifted because we are susceptible defensively because of the challenges we've got with injuries and players who haven't been selected.\n\n\"I judge Southgate in this tournament by kicking on. We haven't beaten anyone. This England side has not beaten anyone, on paper, in a 50/50 game or a game where potentially the balance is with the opposition.\n\n\"We've beaten everyone we should beat and then when we've come up against someone that we potentially might have some challenges with, that's the end of us.\"\n\nBut Schmeichel admitted it was this narrative and the pressure that is on England's Euro squad to come back home with the trophy that would completely put him off being part of the current squad.\n\n\"I'd hate to be a player in a country where the narrative is you must win a tournament because you now have the best league in the world,\" he said. \"The Premier League is no doubt the best in the world, but it's not just English players playing in that.\n\n\"To a large degree, the best player in the England squad plays in Spain.\n\n\"I understand that emotionally you want to win something, but to actually demand it, you can't do that because you have got the other teams saying the exact same.\n\n\"And it is a competition - it comes down to the little things on the day. England losing in the final against Italy three years ago, it's what happens on the day.\n\n\"It's got nothing to do with Southgate being a good or bad manager. He took them there, there's two teams left and one will win. Unfortunately for England it wasn't their day.\n\n\"But to demand that you have to win is a bit much.\"\n\nYet Jordan was still insistent that England had put themselves in a position where they were expected to perform to a certain standard at the competition.\n\n\"It's not a demand, it's an expectation,\" said Jordan. \"It's not an ultimatum, I'm not setting a manifesto in front of the England manager saying you must do this, it's a reasonable expectation.\n\n\"When you've got all the best players in English football playing around the world and you've got some of the best players playing for arguably the best team in domestic football, in people like Foden. So you've got this embarrassment of riches.\n\n\"You've also got a variety of other component parts and one of them, only one of them was my mention of the Premier League, I think it's reasonable that every country that builds, that is successful in youth development and youth tournaments like England has been...the next step has got to be to win something!\n\n\"You're acting like a Southgate apologist, because when it comes down to it, a coach has to make big decisions and Southgate, Mr Schmeichel, doesn't make them.\"\n\nAnd when asked by White if he had ever been dubbed a 'Southgate apologist before', Schmeichel could only laugh as he refuted the accusation.\n\n\"I am not!\" he protested. \"I'm just not looking at this from an English point of view, I'm looking at this from a tournament point of view and I see the quality that is around other teams and I don't see England as the team that absolutely must win it.\n\n\"I see England as one of the teams that absolutely can win it, but the competition is fierce.\"", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "uma_gurav@talksport.com", "name": "Uma Gurav", "type":

His absence has raised concerns for Gareth Southgate and the team, who are already dealing with a lack of depth in defense.\n\nLuke Shaw's role and recovery\n\nDespite his limited appearances for Manchester United last season, Gareth Southgate included Luke Shaw in the Euro 2024 squad. Shaw was featured only 15 times in his club and missed many games due to injury. His fitness was a gamble for Southgate, but Shaw's potential impact on the team was undeniable. He played a key role in England's run to the Euro 2021 final, even scoring in the final match.\n\nHowever, Shaw's recovery has been slow. Ahead of the second group stage game against Denmark, it was confirmed that Shaw did not join the rest of the team for training. England's official X account stated: \"25 players are on the pitch for this morning's training session, as @LukeShaw23 continues his individual program elsewhere.\"\n\nThis update has left fans and analysts worried about England's defensive lineup. Southgate has used Kieran Trippier out of position before, but this strategy has flaws. Trippier, playing on his weaker foot, struggled against Serbia, showing the limitations of such an arrangement. Shaw's quick recovery is crucial if England aims to go far in the tournament.\n\nEngland's defensive concerns\n\nEngland's lack of depth at left-back is a significant issue. Shaw's fitness is a concern; without him, Southgate has to rely on less ideal options. The situation became evident during the match against Serbia when Trippier's positioning issues highlighted the need for a natural left-back.\n\nThe team's defensive stability is at risk without Shaw. His ability to contribute both defensively and offensively makes him a valuable player. Southgate hopes to see Shaw return for the final group-stage game against Slovenia. Having him back would strengthen the defense and balance the team's formation more.\n\nShaw was on the bench for England's opening win against Serbia but was unused. This cautious approach indicates that Southgate knows Shaw's importance and does not want to risk further injury. The manager is likely saving Shaw for crucial moments later in the tournament, provided he regains full fitness.\n\nIn the meantime, England must adapt and make the best use of available players. The match against Denmark will test the team's resilience and ability to cope without a key player. Another important defender, Kyle Walker is expected to play a significant role and join Southgate for the pre-match media conference in Frankfurt.\n\nThe importance of Luke Shaw's presence\n\nShaw's influence extends beyond his defensive duties. His ability to push forward and support the attack adds another dimension to England's play. His crossing ability and vision can create scoring opportunities, making him a dual threat on the pitch. Without him, England loses a vital part of their strategy.\n\nMoreover, Shaw's experience in big matches is invaluable. Having played in high-pressure situations, his calmness and leadership on the field can help guide younger players. This experience is something England desperately needs in a tournament setting where every match can be decisive.\n\nThe road ahead for England in Euro 2024 is challenging. While the team has shown promise, the absence of key players like Shaw could be a hurdle. Southgate's management skills and the squad's adaptability will be tested. The hope is that Shaw's training program will enable him to return to full fitness soon, providing a much-needed boost to the team.\n\nShaw's absence from training is a worrying sign for England as they prepare for their Euro 2024 clash with Denmark. His potential impact on the team is immense, and his recovery is crucial for England's success in the tournament. Southgate and the team must navigate these challenges and hope for Shaw's swift return to bolster their defensive line.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fahad_hamid@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Fahad Hamid", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/England-news-Three-Lions-suffer-massive-injury-blow-ahead-of-Denmark-clash-in-Euro-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658686", "eventUri": "eng-9658686", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

What a coup.\n\nAnd he could have saved himself a whole lot of time on the training pitch as King Arthur is 'summoning the spirit of the ancients'. Job done. Bosh.\n\nAlmost as bad are the Mirror, who are summoning the spirits of the ancient ways of life as they claim - on the actual front page of a national newspaper - that 'MILLIONS of fans are knocking off early today to back England' as they 'cram into pubs, bars and fan zones'.\n\nOr, as it's 2024, millions of people will just turn off their laptops at the usual time and walk into the other room to switch on the TV. Or maybe they will just watch on the world wide web?!\n\nDoom with a view\n\nThe back page of the Daily Mail brings us news from the Gareth Southgate press conference with a headline of 'BLOCK IT OUT' as 'Southgate urges stars to ignore doom-mongers'.\n\nSami Mokbel then writes - apparently without a hint of irony - that 'Southgate's side have faced criticism from ex-players and pundits despite winning their first game of Euro 2024 versus Serbia last weekend.'\n\nDamn those doom-mongers among ex-players and pundits. There has definitely been none of that from journalists, has there? And definitely not from the Mail, apart from:\n\n'England must rearrange the furniture in their starting XI after nervy win over Serbia, writes IAN LADYMAN... Trent Alexander-Arnold needs to be stood down from central midfield role'\n\n'Yes, Harry Kane is dropping too deep. But who can blame him when he's so rarely given the ball? Asks IAN LADYMAN'\n\n'Jude Bellingham follows three generational England legends in having the country's hopes rest on him. He plays like he's unbeatable but others must step up, writes OLIVER HOLT'\n\n'England vs Denmark is Trent Alexander-Arnold's final audition, writes OLIVER HOLT. But Gareth Southgate knows playing safe at this Euros is not going to be enough'\n\nIt looks suspiciously like IAN LADYMAN and OLIVER HOLT might be among the doom-mongers.\n\nThat latest piece from Ladyman (sorry, LADYMAN) is an odd one because Kane quite clearly was not dropping deep in the first half v Serbia (Jamie Carragher said he was playing more like Erling Haaland than Harry Kane) and even in the second half, his average position was in advance of every other England player.\n\nThere was something off about England's performance against Serbia, for sure, and Kane's match statistics point to that.\n\nHis most regular supply - six passes - was from goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, who kicked the ball long more often than any England goalkeeper for quite some time. Second on the list was Jude Bellingham with five passes and that probably reflected how close the two men were standing to each other on occasion.\n\nBut Kane should have received the ball more from Bellingham than any other outfield player; he was the No. 10 after all, despite the handy little info box that tells us that 'PHIL FODEN played the full 90 minutes in behind Kane'. Nope. He really didn't.\n\nBut as Ladyman writes:\n\nAt times it is worth reminding ourselves that they won the game. In England we do seem particularly adept at hand-wringing and that does not just come from the media.\n\nYou literally wrote yesterday that at least one player 'needed to be stood down' after that win, Ian. Maybe take a little look in the mirror.\n\nHis Mail colleague Holt is also raging against the hand-wringers:\n\nIt gave Southgate the latitude to smile wryly at some of the hand-wringing that has gone on since and remind England's players that even triumphs will be treated as disasters by the kind of observers who say he is a failure because England have not won the last three major tournaments in a row.\n\nThe 'kind of observers' who would write in literally the same article that 'as far as the experiment of playing Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield is concerned, this is the final audition'. Those kind of observers?\n\nGareth Southgate is ready to throw his support behind Trent Alexander-Arnold and Phil Foden and give them another chance to silence their doubters.\n\n'Another chance'? He is going to give the Premier League Player of the Year 'another chance' after a 1-0 win in the first game of a major tournament? Do you think France might give Kylian Mbappe 'another chance' if he is fit to play too?\n\nQuestions have been raised over whether or not Alexander-Arnold and Foden should start for England, but Southgate wants another look at the pair.\n\nHe wants 'another look'? What utter nonsense. This - barring Luke Shaw at left-back - is his first-choice XI in the absence of Harry Maguire. He hasn't just stumbled into playing this team; he's not just thrown some names in the air.\n\nBehave. He's not playing Ollie Watkins or Cole Palmer.", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football News -"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Icebergs are up ahead and there is more chance of their players hitting those than the back of the net.\n\nThink of Stuart Pearce in 1990, Gareth Southgate in 1996, David Batty in 1998, David Seaman in 2002, Harry Kane in 2022 and now Declan Rice and his pals in 2024. The names change but the story does not.\n\nPressure always gets to them.\n\nSouthgate knows all about it. As a player he is remembered for the penalty he missed, rather than the medals he won.\n\nNow as a manager, he is trying to guide his players through the minefield of a championship where a 58-year wait doubles up as an unbearable weight.\n\n\"It's very rare at their club they'd win a game and experience what they've experienced over the last couple of days,\" Southgate said in the aftermath of their 1-0 win over Serbia.\n\nIf that performance was bad, this was worse - not just from the players but also the manager.\n\nHe keeps making mistakes, his team a reflection of his country's politics, populated by people who once appeared to be at home on the right but who have now drifted left.\n\nNeither Phil Foden nor Kieran Trippier look comfortable there, Trippier constantly checking back onto his right foot, Foden just abandoning his post completely to go walkabout.\n\nIt wasn't the only thing he was good at giving up. Possession, he decided, was not worth nine tenths of the law. His passing was sloppy, his shooting inaccurate, his finger-pointing world class as he glanced around to find someone else to blame for his own shortcomings.\n\nIf Foden took the biscuit, Declan Rice took the tin, a player who reminds you of the old Everton and Tottenham midfielder, Vinny Samways. So conservative was his passing, the Spurs fans renamed him Vinny Sideways.\n\nThat's Rice, his style of play as dull as his personality.\n\nAnd that's this England team.\n\nWatching them in major tournaments is like watching Elvis perform in a karaoke bar.\n\nYou know they are capable of better but time after time, World Cup after European Championship, they fall apart under the expectation.\n\nAnd the burden gets to them.\n\nThere is serious talent in that team. But they can't sustain it through 90 minutes. Against Serbia on Sunday and now against Denmark today, they started well and then fell asleep, Kyle Walker's pace setting up Harry Kane for the opening goal, Rice's positional sloppiness allowing Morten Hjulmund to equalise.\n\nQuestions about the England goalkeeper again need to be asked after that goal. Pickford is too small, too slow, too bloody average to be part of a championship winning team.\n\nJude Bellingham certainly isn't.\n\nFootball teams drooled when they saw Bellingham appear on the market last summer. He didn't run, he glided.\n\nAll that power and strength and speed. They could just imagine what he would do with a football.\n\nThe problem for England is getting the ball to him.\n\nReal Madrid don't have that issue.\n\nBut England does.\n\nTheir players were unable to vary the angles of their runs to get in position to give or receive a pass and as the game wore on and the Danes grew in confidence, a shock seemed entirely possible.\n\nCredit actually has to go to Southgate for bravely substituting three marquee players, Kane, Foden and Saka for three comparative newcomers: Watkins, Boden and Eke.\n\nThat was a big call, Watkins' energy justifying it even if Eke failed to get to the pitch of the game.\n\nTo be fair, he had only 22 minutes to do so.\n\nDeclan Rice had 90 and couldn't manage it.\n\nIndeed, as the night wore on, he became even more negative in his play. Rather than pass sideways, he started going backwards, sending one pass straight over his own endline for a Danish corner, later giving a hospital pass to Marc Guehi, who amended his own mistake to stop Denmark advancing on goal.\n\nSo England survived.\n\nBut for how much longer?\n\nAt the end the players looked out on their feet. Play like this again and it won't be long before they are out of the tournament.\n\nThey had no zip, no energy, no poise ... and no Jack Grealish.\n\nOf all the England players Ireland could have had in an alternative history, Grealish's sorcery is the one we miss the most.\n\nWe could have done with Galwegian Kane's goals, too, but there is no point having a taker of goals in your team if you don't have a maker of them.\n\nThat's Grealish.\n\nWhen others panic, he stays calm.\n\nWhen they need the ball to stick, he holds it up.\n\nWhen you lack balance on your left-hand-side, he provides some.\n\nHow Southgate didn't consider him worthy of a place in his squad is a mystery.\n\nHow Declan Rice got tagged with a world class label is an even bigger puzzle.\n\nOverrated, overpriced and overhyped, he sums up this English side.\n\nAll fur coat and no knickers.\n\nFootball's coming home? No, but England will be, if not at the quarter final stage then the round before.\n\nGet the latest sports headlines straight to your inbox by signing up for free email alerts.", "source": {"uri":

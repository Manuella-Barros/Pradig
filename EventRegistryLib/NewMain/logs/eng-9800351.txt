Ham United are intensifying their search for a new right-back, with the 2024/25 Premier League season on the horizon.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, the Hammers have set their sights on a move for Newcastle United defender Kieran Trippier.\n\nThe Hammers have been busy bolstering other areas of the squad with the arrivals of six new players, but the full-back position remains a priority for manager Julen Lopetegui.\n\nWest Ham had pursued deals for Manchester United's Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Southampton's Kyle Walker-Peters, but they weren't able to reach an agreement to sign either.\n\nWhile the club retains an interest in both players, they have decided to cast a wider net and explore alternative options, with Trippier emerging as the latest name on their radar.\n\nThe England international has been a standout performer for the Magpies since joining from Atletico Madrid in 2022, helping to secure Champions League football.\n\nHowever, his future at St James' Park is uncertain, with Saudi Arabian clubs expressing interest in his services.\n\nTrippier's contract runs out next summer, meaning he could potentially negotiate a pre-contract agreement with other clubs from January if he doesn't sign a new deal with Newcastle.\n\nVladimir Coufal was a mainstay at right-back for West Ham last season, starting all but two Premier League games, but Lopetegui is keen to add competition and depth to the position.\n\nTrippier has been a key player since joining Newcastle, and he played a crucial role in the club's fairytale run to Champions League qualification in 2022/23.\n\nHowever, the Englishman is approaching the twilight of his career and has become increasingly error-prone.\n\nWhile his experience would be welcomed at the London Stadium, Trippier is more likely to be a liability than an asset in Lopetegui's side.\n\nHis chance creation ability (13 big chances created last season) could be a game-changer for West Ham, but we're better off exploring other younger and more reliable options on the market.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

summer after they completed a deal to sign Max Kilman from Wolves earlier this summer.\n\nThere is a clear indication from West Ham that new defenders are needed at the London Stadium after their poor

numerous occasions, but the Magpies find themselves in a difficult position as this could be the last opportunity for them to get a decent fee for the England international.\n\nAny fee for Trippier

the 31-year-old made 47 appearances in all competitions last season, but Lopetegui has clearly identified the position as an area that needs strengthening.\n\nCoufal is currently out of contract in

Noussair Mazraoui was targeted only for a deal to fall through, while no progress has been made in their efforts to land Southampton man Kyle Walker-Peters.\n\nLopetegui has already made several new additions to his squad. Crysencio Summerville, Niclas Fullkrug and Guido Rodriguez have moved to the London Stadium in the last week, joining Luiz Guilherme, Wes Foderingham and Max Kilman.\n\nTrippier could be next. The England international, who featured during the run to the Euro 2024 final, is in the final year of his Newcastle contract and could be allowed to leave.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, West Ham have yet to receive an answer on Trippier's availability. However, he's understood to be one of the full-back options on their radar, while there is also interest from clubs in Saudi Arabia.\n\nWest Ham have also been linked with German international centre-back Mats Hummels, who is a free agent after leaving Borussia Dortmund. Brighton are also keen on the 35-year-old, who scored in last season's Champions League semi-finals.\n\nNew manager Lopetegui, who replaced David Moyes following the end of the 2023-24 season, has made clear the size of the task ahead. The Hammer, who kick off their Premier League campaign against Aston Villa on August 17, lost both games on their pre-season tour of the US against Wolves and Crystal Palace.\n\nWould Kieran Trippier be a good fit for West Ham? Have your say in the comments section\n\n\"We have 15 days to keep working and keep going to put the team in the best way for the first step that is, of course, the first Premier League match against Aston Villa,\" Lopetegui said after the Palace game. West Ham went in level at the break in Tampa, but two goals inside five second-half minutes gave Palace victory.\n\n\"Of course, we have to improve on a lot of things and I think maybe more or less the same as the Wolves game, until 60 minutes we have been balanced in the match,\" he added. \"After, we have to analyse and ensure we are able to do better, to defend better and don't concede easy goals. I think we have to change this.\n\n\"We are working hard and we know that we have worked very, very hard, so it's possible that the legs were a little bit tired, so I think we have two days until we go back to London, then we will start the new week with new energy knowing that we have one other friendly match in our stadium to be ready for the key date which is Aston Villa.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Struggles to secure Wan-Bissaka or Walker-Peters lead to interest in Trippier, with potential move still being explored. Tammy Abraham targeted as potential attacking option, with West Ham submitting a \u00a326 million offer for the Roma forward.\n\nWest Ham United, in their attempts to snare a right-back before the summer transfer window closes for business, have identified Newcastle United and England star Kieran Trippier as a potential acquisition, per The Telegraph.\n\nThe Premier League campaign starts next week and Julen Lopetegui and Co already have the likes of Maximilian Kilman, Niclas Fullkrug and Crysencio Summerville on board in east London.\n\nRelated West Ham 'Busy' Working on Two More Signings\n\nWest Ham United are on course to fall short of signing Jean-Clair Todibo\n\n1\n\nLopetegui's revamped squad looks primed to challenge for European football next season as the 2022/23 Europa Conference League winners look to impress outside their domestic league. However, an area that still needs to be reinforced is at right-back.\n\nWest Ham Identify Trippier as Potential Option Wan-Bissaka deal still to be thrashed out Close\n\nAaron Wan-Bissaka and Kyle Walker-Peters of Manchester United and Southampton, respectively, have been previously earmarked - especially the former - as West Ham's primary options in the summer market.\n\nThe capital club have been able to strike a deal for either thus far - hence their interest in Trippier, 33. According to a report from The Telegraph, West Ham are currently exploring whether a move for the veteran defednder is feasible.\n\nAlthough Trippier, a 54-cap England international, has been linked with a move to the Saudi Pro League in recent memory, whether he is actually available, particularly from clubs in England's top flight, remains a question.\n\nTrippier, Coufal, Wan-Bissaka - 23/24 League Stats\n\nStatistic\n\nTrippier\n\nCoufal\n\nWan-Bissaka\n\nMinutes\n\n2,240\n\n3,140\n\n1,782\n\nGoals\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nAssists\n\n10\n\n7\n\n2\n\nPass success rate (%)\n\n79.7\n\n73\n\n82.9\n\nTackles per game\n\n2\n\n1.8\n\n1.9\n\nInterceptions per game\n\n0.9\n\n1.2\n\n1.9\n\nOverall rating\n\n7.07\n\n6.58\n\n6.75\n\nFormerly of Tottenham Hotspur, Trippier's move from Atletico Madrid in January 2022 somewhat transformed the Magpies' back line, registering four goals and 21 assists in 92 games.\n\nLast term alone, the right-back - who skippered Eddie Howe's side on 15 different occasions in the Premier League - racked up 39 appearances across all competitions, including all six outings in the Champions League.\n\nAt the time of writing, the ex-Manchester City youth prospect's deal expires in the summer of 2025, leaving his current employers in an unfavourable position at the negotiation table. In January, when he has six months left, he would be able to speak to clubs about signing a pre-contract.\n\nVladimiar Coufal was present on the right for all but a couple of Premier League outings for West Ham in 2023/24 but, under the Lopetegui-led regime, his game time may not be as regular next term.\n\nWest Ham Submit \u00a326m Offer for Tammy Abraham Striker prefers to remain in Serie A\n\nDespite securing the aforementioned Fullkrug, 31, for an undisclosed fee earlier this window, the east Londoners are still keen to add another face to their attacking constellation - namely, Roma's Tammy Abraham or Jhon Duran of Aston Villa.\n\nAccording to Calcio Mercato, West Ham have lodged a \u00a326 million-worth bid for former Chelsea centre forward Abraham, who is deemed surplus to requirements by Roma boss Daniele De Rossi, largely thanks to the addition of Artem Dovbyk.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: In 89 Premier League games - for Chelsea, Swansea and Aston Villa - Abraham recorded 26 goals and five assists.\n\nMarking an end to his three-season stint at the Stadio Olimpico, the one-time Champions League winner is expected to leave this summer, though he prefers a move that would see him remain in Italy's top flight.\n\nAC Milan, according to the report, remain frontrunners in the race for his signature, though it remains to be seen where he'll end up. Elsewhere, Colombian Duran is still on their radar, despite the lack of noise surrounding his name.\n\nAll statistics per WhoScored", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Wan-Bissaka", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Wan-Bissaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker-Peters", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker-Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julen_Lopetegui", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Julen Lopetegui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crysencio_Summerville", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crysencio Summerville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Clair_Todibo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Clair Todibo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladim\u00edr_Coufal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladim\u00edr Coufal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_competitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA competitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

Trippier has been tracked by Saudi Pro League clubs and sides in Europe this summer and has just a year left on his contract.\n\nWest Ham head coach Julen Lopetegui believes Trippier is a good fit for the Hammers although Howe is content to hold on to the man who spearheaded United as the first major signing after the takeover. Trippier would have to fight for his place with Tino Livramento this season but Howe values his experience.\n\nREAD MORE: Sean Longstaff names three players who get unfair criticism at Newcastle United\n\nREAD MORE: The inside story of the Miley brothers as third hot prospect bursts on to the scene\n\nBut if West Ham can essentially offer him an extended contract which Newcastle have so far not managed to put on the table, Trippier may have a decision to make. The 33-year-old former Man City and Burnley man returned to Benton earlier this week after an extended holiday following his efforts with England at the European Championships.\n\nTrippier was pictured with Thomas Spring, the head scout of Al-Ettifaq, but Howe played down the incident after it appeared on Instagram with a caption reading: \"Good meeting.\"\n\nHowe said last week in Japan: \"It is difficult for me to comment on. For Kieran he is on holiday and he is having down time after exploits with the national team.\n\n\"Yeah, he has total freedom to enjoy his holiday. The picture (of Trippier posing with a head scout at Al-Ettifaq) in question is a personal relationship, I don't think it is related to any club.\"\n\nTrippier's future with England is also unclear after the resignation of Gareth Southgate as Three Lions boss. It is expected that Under-21 coach Lee Carsley takes over as caretaker.\n\nGet ready for Newcastle United's big kick off with our brilliant new season special.

While the England international, who started six games at Euro 2024 has been linked with Saudi Arabian clubs, his situation at St James' Park and whether he would be on the market is yet to be determined.\"\n\nMeanwhile, there is widespread belief within Spanish media that West Ham have already made contact with Girona defender Arnau Martinez.\n\nMundo Deportivo claims an opening offer - fee unknown - is likely to be sent to the Catalan club in the coming days.\n\nArnau's contract at Girona expires in 2025, but this shows that West Ham seem happy to brief that they are considering other targets. Is this all just a tactic while they finalise a deal with United for Wan-Bissaka?\n\nWest Ham want Wan-Bissaka and the player is open to the move.\n\nJust a few days ago, the media suggested a move was almost set in stone - so it was odd seeing him start against Liverpool in the final pre-season tour friendly.\n\nI still think Wan-Bissaka will end up at West Ham this summer. Otherwise he can leave as a free agent next summer, after entering the final 12 months of his deal at Old Trafford.\n\nSubscribe to the Stretty News podcast Strettycast for weekly episodes on Manchester United.

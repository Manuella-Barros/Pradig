With a little consistency, hair growth will spring into action. Few beauty concerns can feel quite as terrifying\u2014and insidious\u2014as hair loss. Unlike acne or hyperpigmentation, which can crop up overnight or over several weeks, hair loss tends to develop so slowly that by the time you realize it\u2019s happened, it becomes harder to treat. While some forms of hair loss can be less challenging to address (like the hair fall caused by the dramatic hormone swings that come with pregnancy and childbirth), all hair loss can take a toll on one\u2019s self-esteem. So if you\u2019re noticing thinning hair, it\u2019s time to act. We highly recommend seeing a dermatologist who can develop a treatment plan tailored to your unique situation\u2014and while waiting for your appointment, you can start using a hair loss treatment at home. To find the best hair loss treatments, we tested 20 unique formulas, spending 960 hours over a 12-week testing period, evaluating them on application, efficacy, and overall results. From there, we narrowed down our list to 13 formulas. Hair loss doesn\u2019t happen overnight so treatment won\u2019t work that quickly, either. \u201cGenerally speaking, you would want to apply topical treatments twice a day for three to six months to really see growth benefits,\u201d says Victoria Fu, cosmetic chemist and cofounder of Chemist Confessions. \u201cIt takes patience and consistency to see a difference!\u201d Best Overall: Virtue Minoxidil 5% Hair Growth Treatment $134 at Amazon.com $134 at Nordstrom.com Why We Love It: We went into testing this product with a specific goal in mind\u2014repairing the damage done to our edges caused by the tension of protective styles as well as heat. This product did just that, making them look fuller by the end of the testing period. Most notably, we got these results without using the product daily. We didn\u2019t want to disrupt our wash routine, so we applied the formula every two weeks, and despite this, we still achieved the results we were looking for. At no point did the hair loss treatment make our hair look greasy or feel weighed down, nor did it irritate our scalp. Who It's For: If you\u2019re looking for a full hair loss treatment system, give this one a try. In addition to the minoxidil foam, it comes with a shampoo and conditioner formulated to support stronger, healthier hair growth. While it can be used by individuals with a variety of hair loss causes, this set in particular is ideal for those who are managing shedding caused by hormonal fluctuations, making it a great pick for new moms. Editor Tip: One pump of foam was plenty to address our entire scalp. When we wanted to concentrate our application solely on our edges, we only needed half a pump to get the job done. Type: Foam\uff5cActive Ingredients: Minoxidil\uff5cFDA Approved: Yes\uff5cUsage: Once daily\uff5cSize: 2.11 oz Best Budget: Kirkland Signature Men's Minoxidil 5% Extra Strength Topical Solution See at Https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7799179/type/dlg/sid/8659471%7C%7C%7C%7Cyahoo%7C/https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-hair-regrowth-treatment-extra-strength-for-men%2C-5%-minoxidil-topical-solution%2C-2-fl-oz%2C-6-pack.product.11501138.html Why We Love It: This very affordable set from Costco gave us six months\u2019 worth of product; we saw results from twice-daily treatment in half that time. Each treatment features a cap with a built-in dropper, so dosing and application was very straightforward. The formula dispensed easily and didn\u2019t irritate our scalps. Who It's For: Anyone who wants to target hair loss on the crown of their head should give this product a shot. It may also be best for those with coarser hair textures, as the formula took a long time to absorb into our fine, straight hair. Though the packaging says it\u2019s for use by men only, the active ingredient is the same as those found in products marketed towards women, so keep that in mind. Editor Tip: Truthfully, we weren\u2019t convinced this product was working\u2014we would check our hair periodically leading up to the three-month mark, and what we saw didn\u2019t make us feel confident in the efficacy of the formula. However, we could see a significant improvement to our hair growth by the end of the testing period, so committment is key! Type: Topical solution\uff5cActive Ingredients: Minoxidil\uff5cFDA Approved: Yes\uff5cUsage: Twice daily\uff5cSize: 2 oz Best Natural Hair Loss Treatment: Advanced Trichology NutraM Topical Melatonin Hair Growth Serum See at Advancedtrichology.com Why We Love It: This was the only minoxidil-free product we tested to make the cut, and while it didn\u2019t contain any of the expert-recommended ingredients suggested below, it contains niacin, a form of vitamin B that stimulates blood circulation (always a good thing). We loved how quickly this product took effect\u2014we saw improvements in about a month\u2014and how the formula never made our hair feel or look greasy thanks to its surprisingly dry texture, which was absorbed within minutes of application. We also loved the price point, which was more affordable than others we\u2019d tried. Who It's For: Give this product a go if you\u2019re not interested in using a product formulated with minoxidil and prefer more natural ingredients. This is also a good choice if you have very fine hair that tends to get greasy easily, as the texture of the serum doesn\u2019t leave a residue behind. (This also makes it ideal for people who are wary of gunking up their bedsheets with a hair loss treatment.) Editor Tip: You can use a full dropper or two for treatment, which is a lot of product, and still not have to worry about burning through the bottle too quickly. After our testing period, we still had half a bottle left! Be aware that the scent of this product is pretty strong at first, but dissipates very quickly. Type: Topical solution\uff5cActive Ingredients: Niacin, melatonin, panthenol\uff5cFDA Approved: No\uff5cUsage: At least once daily, preferably overnight\uff5cSize: 2 oz Best Treatment for Hair Loss and Thinning Hair: Nioxin 5% Minoxidil Hair Regrowth Treatment For Men See at Ulta.com Why We Love It: After nine weeks of consistent use, we saw noticeable growth where our hair was thinning, with little hairs sprouting up in sparse areas. It was easy to incorporate this twice-daily treatment into our daily routine as we work from home, so we never had to worry about packing it to go. Though the formula was runny, it absorbed easily within a few minutes of massaging it in. Who It's For: Men experiencing mild hair loss should give this formula a try. Though it\u2019s not a dealbreaker, we\u2019d also suggest using it if you have someone to help you apply it (more on this below). Editor Tip: We\u2019ll confess that we found this product a little cumbersome to use. To make sure we applied it evenly to the area of our scalp where we were experiencing thinning, we had to stand in front of our bathroom mirror, then hold another mirror in one hand and the dropper in the other\u2014and the treatment was very runny, which added to the challenge. We\u2019d recommend applying this with the help of a partner for a smoother experience. Type: Solution\uff5cActive Ingredients: Minoxidil\uff5cFDA Approved: Yes\uff5cUsage: Twice daily\uff5cSize: 2 oz Best Drugstore: hers Women\u2019s Minoxidil 2% Topical Solution See at Forhers.com $15 at Macys.com Why We Love It: We didn\u2019t think much was happening while testing this product, so we were shocked by our before and after photos. After the full trial period, we observed that our hair definitely looks fuller, and our hairline is denser. We were also very pleased to see the new growth that came courtesy of this product. Who It's For: We\u2019d recommend this to someone who already has an established morning and evening beauty routine. As minimalists, we frequently found ourselves forgetting to apply this product and having to go back to our bathrooms to put it on. It\u2019s also best for someone who is averse to heavy fragrances\u2014this formula had no scent at all. Editor Tip: This product wasn\u2019t hard to use, but we found that we had to remind ourselves to use it because it didn't feel like a natural part of our routine when our hair wasn't wet. Though it absorbed well, it left our hair a bit wet to the touch for about 10 minutes. This made our hair look greasy for those 10 minutes, so we had to build that time into our morning prep. Type: Solution\uff5cActive Ingredients: Minoxidil\uff5cFDA Approved: Yes\uff5cUsage: Twice daily\uff5cSize: 2 oz Best for Hair Fall and Regrowth: Rogaine Women's 5% Minoxidil Foam for Hair Thinning and Loss $44 at Amazon.com $60 at Cvs.com Why We Love It: We\u2019d been shedding a lot more hair than we used to ahead of trying this formula; in just three weeks, we noticed a significantly reduced amount of hair fall, as well as some new growth. It absorbed quickly and was relatively easy to use, with a little of the foam going a long way to cover our entire scalp. It did create a bit of a tingling sensation, but we didn\u2019t mind\u2014it made us feel like it was working (which it was!). Who It's For: If you lack the patience of applying a product twice daily, you\u2019ll appreciate this formula as it only needs to be applied once daily to achieve results. We have fine, straight hair and didn\u2019t feel like the product weighed it down, which is a bonus for those with our same hair type. However, this formula can leave a little bit of a residue on hair, which could affect styling somewhat; if you wash your hair every morning and apply this product the night before, you\u2019ll never have an issue. Editor Tip: This sounds a little funky, but we recommend your hands are as cold as possible ahead of applying this product. That\u2019s because we found that having warm hands caused the foam to dissolve more rapidly. The more intact the foam is, the easier time you\u2019ll have dispersing the formula across your scalp\u2014trust us. Type: Foam\uff5cActive Ingredients: Minoxidil\uff5cFDA Approved: Yes\uff5cUsage: Once daily\uff5cSize: 2.11 oz Best Hair Loss Treatment for Receding Hairline: Keranique Hair Regrowth Treatment for Women 2% Minoxidil Topical Solution USP $29 at Amazon.com See at Ulta.com Why We Love It: Though the results weren\u2019t dramatic, we were pleasantly surprised by the noticeable difference this product made to our hair. In eight or nine weeks, we saw a lot of baby hairs crop up, especially along the hairline, including our temples. The product absorbs within five minutes of application (and didn\u2019t make our hair look stringy at all); though it has a chemical-like smell, it was pretty mild and wasn\u2019t potent enough to bother us. Who It's For: This product features a very precise spray applicator, which makes it ideal for use by someone who has targeted areas of hair loss they\u2019d like to address. The nozzle made it simple to get a concentrated application right on our temples. It\u2019s also great for people with fine hair\u2014the formula never made ours look greasy! Editor Tip: While testing this product, our husband was also testing a hair loss treatment. We found that we had a significantly easier time applying our product than he did because of the convenient spray nozzle. We\u2019ll also add that while the instructions say to use six pumps, we found that to be overkill, and believe that four would be sufficient for most people. Type: Spray\uff5cActive Ingredients: Minoxidil\uff5cFDA Approved: Yes\uff5cUsage: Twice daily\uff5cSize: 2 oz Best Dermatologist-Recommended: Rogaine Women's 2% Minoxidil Topical Solution Hair Regrowth Treatment See at Cvs.com See at Rogaine.com Why We Love It: Rogaine is the top derm-recommended hair loss treatment, and after the trial period, we can see why. After eight weeks of use, we saw an improvement in density to the receding areas of our hairline, with thinning spots noticeably filled in. Though we occasionally felt a tingling sensation upon application, we didn\u2019t experience any irritation or sensitivity, and there was no smell. Who It's For: We\u2019d recommend this formula to anyone hoping to regrow hair, especially if they\u2019re prone to experiencing sensitivity as this product was very gentle on the scalp. Though it\u2019s designed to address thinning on the top of the scalp, we focused our application on our hairline and saw great results, so we\u2019d suggest this product to anyone with thinning hair, regardless of where the loss is. You should just be prepared for twice-daily application! Editor Tip: Though this formula is said to be safe for color-treated hair, proceed with caution. We used it on freshly dyed hair and within one week of our hair appointment, we saw grays again. Makes sense\u2014the formula features an alcohol base, and alcohol strips hair color. Type: Solution\uff5cActive Ingredients: Minoxidil\uff5cFDA Approved: Yes\uff5cUsage: Twice daily\uff5cSize: 2 oz Best for Sensitive Scalps: keeps 5% Minoxidil Foam $61 at Amazon.com See at Keeps.com Why We Love It: We\u2019ve used a handful of hair loss treatments before, and this one has the edge. We found that this one was the gentlest of all that we\u2019ve tried\u2014we\u2019d consider it \u201cskin friendly,\u201d in fact\u2014and delivered some results within six weeks. It was also easy to apply and the formula didn\u2019t negatively affect the look and style of our hair after application. Who It's For: If you\u2019ve used other hair loss treatments in the past only to be left with a sensitized scalp, give this one a go. This is also a great pick for someone who is on the go. We found that the foam applied similarly to mousse and absorbed easily, fully drying in about five minutes without changing the texture or appearance of our hair. Editor Tip: The can of product is dosed exceedingly well. While we thought we\u2019d have plenty of product left after the trial, we found that the cans lasted exactly three months. Type: Foam\uff5cActive Ingredients: Minoxidil\uff5cFDA Approved: Yes\uff5cUsage: Twice daily\uff5cSize: 2.11 oz Best for New Growth: Roman Minoxidil Topical Treatment for Men $40 at Amazon.com $45 at Cvs.com Why We Love It: We\u2019d used other minoxidil hair loss treatments before and were dissatisfied by how messy the foams were\u2014we didn\u2019t feel like we got enough into our scalps and required more prep on our part. This liquid solution from Roman was much more satisfying, with a precise applicator that allowed us to get up close and personal with our scalps. We also felt the bottles were very travel friendly. Who It's For: We\u2019d recommend this to someone with hair that tends to fall on the oily side, because once this product dried, it made our hair very stiff and hard to style; some natural oils would have helped with that. The formula also dried out our hair a bit and made it a little frizzier than it used to be. We\u2019ve counteracted this with leave-in treatments, but we\u2019re fairly sure those with oilier hair may not face the same issues. Editor Tip: We\u2019d suggest buying a separate scalp massager to use with this product. We didn\u2019t have one and wished we did\u2014it would have helped us get even more of the solution into our scalps while stimulating blood flow. Even though the dropper packaged with this product was more precise than other products we used, we still found that our hair ended up absorbing a bunch of the solution. Type: Solution\uff5cActive Ingredients: Minoxidil\uff5cFDA Approved: Yes\uff5cUsage: Twice daily\uff5cSize: 2 oz Best Fast-Acting: hers Minoxidil Foam for Women $28 at App.revolve.com See at Cvs.com Why We Love It: We were stunned by how rapidly this product began to work\u2014we noticed our hair looking fuller and growing faster just one month into our test. (We wouldn\u2019t have believed it ourselves if not for the fact that we dye our hair, and our roots grew in much more quickly than usual.) We appreciated that a little went a long way (only half a cap full of foam) and just once-daily application was required. Who It's For: This is an ideal pick for someone who wants to see results fast and appreciates the convenience of a foam formula, which we felt wasn\u2019t as messy as a liquid product. Be aware that this formula did make our hair look greasy\u2014while it appeared less oily as the day went on, our hair still had a noticeable sheen from the product by the end of the day. We have very fine hair; those with coarser hair textures may not experience the same level of greasiness. Editor Tip: You don\u2019t apply this product directly from the canister\u2014rather, you squirt the foam into the cap until you\u2019ve filled it halfway, then scoop it out to apply it from there. This is a little inconvenient (and the cap is hard to clean), but you only have to do it once daily! Type: Foam\uff5cActive Ingredients: Minoxidil\uff5cFDA Approved: Yes | Usage Once daily\uff5cSize: 2.11 oz Best for Hair Fall: Rogaine Men's 5% Minoxidil Unscented Foam See at Cvs.com See at Instacart.com Why We Love It: While we admittedly didn\u2019t see too much of a difference in terms of growth throughout testing this formula, we did notice an improvement to how much hair was falling out. Our hair loss slowed significantly, and we saw way less shedding than we had previously\u2014there were practically no loose hairs in the sink after two months of testing. We found that it made our hair feel denser, too. Who It's For: Overall, we\u2019d recommend this to pretty much anyone who\u2019s looking for a generally low-risk way to try to treat hair loss. In particular, though, we\u2019d suggest it to someone who\u2019s prone to sensitivity. Our scalps are irritated easily but this formula left us comfortable throughout the entire testing period. Editor Tip: This product is best applied on relatively dry hair, so we had to time the application properly\u2014for example, if we wanted to use it after showering. Make sure you build some time into your schedule for this product when using it close to shower time so you can let your hair partially air-dry ahead of application. Type: Foam\uff5cActive Ingredients: Minoxidil\uff5cFDA Approved: Yes\uff5cUsage: Twice daily\uff5cSize: 2.11 oz Best for Thickness: BosleyMD Men's Extra Strength Minoxidil 5% Spray Topical See at Shop.bosley.com Why We Love It: This formula felt almost like water\u2014it didn\u2019t leave our hair greasy or sticky, weigh down our hair, cause any tingling sensations, or have any odor whatsoever. It was a little messy because of how fluid the formula was, but it was otherwise easy to use thanks to the spray applicator. After about three weeks, we noticed a difference in terms of how thick our hair looked and felt. In balding areas in particular, we saw a thin layer of hair where there had been none previously, and it all grew in evenly. Who It's For: We\u2019d recommend this to anyone who\u2019s experiencing reduced hair density and hoping to achieve new growth. However, it\u2019s important to have reasonable expectations. While the results were noticeable, we wouldn\u2019t call them dramatic. Editor Tip: Though the fluid dispensed by the spray applicator can get a little messy, that\u2019s easily solved by keeping a tissue on hand to dab up any drips. We felt like the nozzle was a great delivery system overall. Even though we followed the instructions\u2014six spritzes per application\u2014we didn\u2019t even get through a whole bottle during our trial period, though we expected to work our way through two. Type: Spray\uff5cActive Ingredients: Minoxidil\uff5cFDA Approved: Yes\uff5cUsage: Twice daily\uff5cSize: 2 oz What to Keep in Mind Your Type of Hair Loss: Figuring out what kind of hair loss you have is relatively easy\u2014just look at the pattern, says board-certified dermatologist Dr. Morgan Rabach, M.D. There are so many factors that play a role in hair loss, including changes to hormone levels, genetics, nutrition and diet, health issues, and medical conditions. For that reason, it\u2019s best to see a dermatologist to get a proper diagnosis of your unique conditions and a targeted course of treatment, says Fu.Female pattern hair loss will typically present as a gradually widening center part. Sometimes circular bald spots, or alopecia areata, appear as hair loses density.Male pattern hair loss manifests as the signature receding hairline.Tension-related shedding usually signals that the follicles that have been subjected to a lot of tension, courtesy of varying hairstyles (such as braids or a tight, high pony), also called traction alopecia.Diffuse thinning is when your whole head of hair overall looks thinner and finer with moderate or severe shedding.Your Commitment Level: Unequivocally, says Fu, you must approach your treatment of choice with an almost militant-like commitment. And you should settle into this routine\u2014for the long haul. \"Most options take three to six months of consistent, daily application to really see any growth benefits from a topical product.\"Product Type: The most common options are topical treatments, ranging from serums, sprays, foams, and lotions, to prescription medication or over-the-counter oral supplements. No matter which route you take, all of them must be used daily to see results of any kind. \u201cThe ideal treatment has to be easy to use,\u201d says scientist Dr. Sanjay Batra, founder of WeThrivv and a former adjunct professor at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine. \u201cI am not a fan of large pills to swallow or serums that leave your scalp greasy because compliance will wane\u2026if something is not easy to use, the chances that you will use it consistently go way down.\u201dActive Ingredients: There are three drugs that you\u2019ll find being used for the treatment of hair loss\u2014corticosteroids, finasteride, and minoxidil.Corticosteroids are administered via injection by a healthcare provider to address a very specific form of hair loss that manifests in stark, circular patches. \u201cCorticosteroids treat alopecia areata, which is believed to be caused by an autoimmune problem,\u201d says board-certified dermatologist Dr. Howard Sobel, M.D. \u201cThey work by decreasing inflammation in the hair follicle.Finasteride, a 5-\u03b1 reductase inhibitor, is a controversial, but effective, option that can only be used for men to target androgenetic alopecia (also known as male pattern baldness). It can be taken as an oral medication or used topically. \u201cIt prevents the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotesterosterone (DHT),\u201d says Dr. Rabach, adding that this ingredient does it's best work with early intervention into the first few years of hair loss. \u201cThis drug is pretty controversial and the potential list of side effects is rather concerning: Erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, problems with ejaculation, testicular pain, and even depression,\u201d warns Dr. Batra.Minoxidil was originally used as a medication to treat blood pressure\u2014and then doctors noticed it was causing patients\u2019 hair to grow, so the drug was repurposed as a hair loss treatment. \u201cIt was reformulated as a topical product and received FDA approval in 1988,\u201d says Dr. Batra. According to Dr. Sobel, it\u2019s believed to work by shortening the resting stage of the hair, triggering blood flow to the follicles, which sends the hair into the growth phase. \u201cThis ultimately decreases hair loss and increases the diameter of each hair,\u201d he says. It\u2019s best for men and women dealing with androgenetic alopecia that have existing hair. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t work on a bald scalp without viable hair follicles,\u201d adds Dr. Sobel.Natural Ingredients to Boost Hair Growth: \u201cThe best natural products tend to have a blend of ingredients targeting the various mechanisms for hair loss,\" says Dr. Batra. Diet plays a crucial role in supporting the effectiveness of any hair loss treatment, says Dr. Rabach, especially those who follow an exclusionary diet. \u201cVegans and vegetarians with hair loss often benefit from B vitamin supplements, folate, and iron,\u201d she says.Caffeine: \u201cThere is a study done on ~200 males that compared a topical 0.2 percent caffeine liquid to 5 percent minoxidil that showed the two to have comparable results,\u201d says Fu.Peppermint Oil: \"Both caffeine and peppermint oil help promote blood flow around the body, and blood flow to the scalp will help bring nutrients to the hair,\" says Dr. Rabach.Rosemary Oil: One of Dr. Sobel's favorite natural ingredients for its blood flow-boosting properties, recent research studies show this anti-inflammatory herbal oil to be as effective as a prescription topical when massaged into the scalp twice daily for six months. Participants in the study also experienced other hair-related benefits, like a major reduction in scalp itchiness, dandruff, and dryness.Onion Juice: Hold your nose and douse your head with this stuff, because it can work wonders for thinning or balding patches in as little as two weeks, according to this surprising National Institutes of Health study.Red Ginseng: As a natural 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, it naturally slows down the body's production of DHT, a known contributor to male pattern baldness.Saw Palmetto: \"This ingredient is used as an oral supplement and has been through a few clinical tests shown to help alopecia,\u201d says Fu.Hair Loss Prescription Medication: \u201cHair loss is multifactorial and many treatments should be used in conjunction,\u201d says Dr. Sobel, adding that prescription medication, over-the-counter topicals, and oral supplements are all treatment options. \u201cAll of these treatments work to stimulate or awaken the hair follicles,\u201d he says. However, they will not work if you are fully bald and have been so for a long time\u2014that\u2019s a sign that the hair follicles are no longer viable. A dormant or \u201clazy\u201d hair follicle can be treated, but a dead one can\u2019t. Your Questions, Answered Can hair grow back after thinning? Sometimes. \u201cIt can grow back and often does, especially when hair loss is sudden and rapid for a medical reason, like pregnancy and birth, trauma, sudden illness, or COVID,\u201d says Dr. Rabach. However, if your hair doesn\u2019t bounce back on its own, continues to thin, and you don\u2019t seek help, you may have trouble achieving the same hair density you once did. How to stop hair fall immediately? Unfortunately, there\u2019s no way to immediately stop rapid hair fall. \u201cHair shedding frequency can really depend on your hair loss situation,\u201d says Fu. Ultimately, the key to retaining hair is to address hair loss as soon as you notice it. \u201cAs in any area of medicine, prevention is key\u2014prevention, then early diagnosis and early treatment,\u201d says Dr. Batra. \u201cThe longer you wait, the harder it is and the more expensive, painful, and/or suboptimal the result will be.\u201d How to regrow thinning hair? Dr. Sobel likes using topicals on his patients, specifically minoxidil for women and a mixture of minoxidil and finasteride for men. He also highly recommends in-office procedures, especially exosome treatments, starting with three sessions spaced a month apart. \u201cExosomes contain thousands of growth factors and stem cells, which tell cells how to act, increasing hair growth, decreasing hair loss, and increasing the diameter of each individual hair,\u201d he says. He administers this treatment using a combination of ultrasound and air pressure, which pushes the exosomes deep into the hair follicles without the need for painful injections or microneedling. How much hair loss is normal? Losing hair every day is completely normal. According to Dr. Rabach, you could lose around 150 hairs a day, which can be very unsettling\u2014and you could lose more, especially if you don\u2019t brush your hair every day. \u201cIt\u2019s important to know that brushing or washing hair does not make hair fall out more,\u201d she adds.

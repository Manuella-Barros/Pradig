{"id": 225054202, "title": "The Gaeltacht housing crisis: 'People can't buy houses or get planning permission and there are few places to rent'", "text": "IRISH LANGUAGE ADVOCATES and people from Gaeltacht areas have called for the Government to take action to address the housing crisis in Irish language speaking areas. In a demonstration outside Leinster House this morning, the B\u00e1n\u00fa campaign group, with support from housing and Irish language advocacy organisations, highlighted the severe lack of housing in Gaeltacht regions. B\u00e1n\u00fa \u2013 which means to become deserted or depopulated (literally \u201cwhitened\u201d) \u2013 was founded last year to advocate for increased housing for Gaeltacht natives and Irish language speakers. Speaking in Irish, Advocacy Manager with Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge and a member of the Meitheal N\u00e1isi\u00fanta Plean\u00e1la Teanga campaign group, R\u00f3is\u00edn Ni Chinn\u00e9ide, said: \u201cT\u00e1imid anseo chun teachtaireacht ana shol\u00e9ir a thabhairt don Rialtas nach bhfuil muid s\u00e1sta leis an tsl\u00ed at\u00e1 siad \u00e1 gcaitheamh le pobail Ghaeltachta.\u201d (\u201cWe are here to send a clear mesage to the Government that we\u2019re not happy with the way they are treating Gaeltacht communities\u201d) N\u00ed Chinn\u00e9ide said the housing crisis had been the main issue raised among people living in Gaeltacht areas for the last number of years. \u201cIs \u00ed an g\u00e9irch\u00e9im tith\u00edochta an rud is m\u00f3 at\u00e1 ag br\u00fa daoine amach \u00f3n Gaeltacht. N\u00ed feidir le daoine cead plean\u00e1la a fh\u00e1il le fanacht ina gceantar f\u00e9in. N\u00ed feidir le daoine tithe a cheannach. Is beag \u00e1it at\u00e1 ar f\u00e1il ar cios go fadthearmach,\u201d she said. (\u201cThe housing crisis is the the biggest thing pushing people out of the Gaeltacht. People can\u2019t get planning permission to stay in their own areas. People can\u2019t buy houses. There are few places available for long term rental\u201d) Latest Census data shows that the proportion of Irish speakers in Gaeltacht areas decreased from 69% in 2011 to 66% in 2022, with advocates putting a lack of places to live as one of the main reasons. Cormac Fitzgerald / TheJouranal Cormac Fitzgerald / TheJouranal / TheJouranal Demands The protestors today had three key demands from Government: That Draft Gaeltacht Planning Guidelines (that campaigners say have been promised by Government since 2021) are published immediately. That \u00dadar\u00e1s na Gaeltachta be given clear functions in law in relation to housing. That the Planning and Development Bill currently moving through the Oireacthas be strengthened as it relates to Gaeltacht areas. The Draft Gaeltacht Planning Guidelines relate to planning permission in the Gaeltacht. The government said recently that they are being finalised and will soon be put out to public consultation. These guidelines when published will provide clarity on building housing in Gaeltacht areas, and may allow that Irish speakers continuing to live in these areas will constitute a \u201clocal need\u201d and so will easier be able to secure planning permission. \u00dadar\u00e1s na Gaeltachta is a state agency responsible for the development of Irish language areas. There have been numerous calls, including from Sinn F\u00e9in, to give the body power in relation to building or leasing housing. While the housing crisis is being felt across the country, campaigners say that the impact it has on native Irish speakers not being able to live their lives where they grew up gives it an extra dimension in Gaeltacht areas. \u201cT\u00e1 s\u00e9 seo ag chur bac m\u00f3r ar muintir na Gaeltachta agus go h\u00e1irithe daoine \u00f3ga gur mhaith leo cur fuatha sna ceantair Gaeltachta agus n\u00ed feidir leo cur fuatha ina gceantar inar th\u00f3gach iad,\u201d said Bl\u00e1ith\u00edn Nic a tSithigh, Leas Uachtar\u00e1n don Ghaeilge le USI (Vice President of Irish with the Union of Students in Ireland). (\u201cThis is putting a big block on Gaeltacht residents, especially young people, who would like to live their lives in Gaeltacht areas and they can\u2019t live in the area they were raised\u201d) Nic a tSithigh is from Dingle, in Co Kerry, and says she would like to move back there soon, but is worried she won\u2019t be able to find anywhere to live. \u201cT\u00e1im buartha. B\u00e1 bhre\u00e1 liom f\u00e9in i gceann c\u00fapla bliana bogadh thar nais, mo theach f\u00e9in a thogaint ach n\u2019fheadar an mbeidh an deis sin agam mar sa sl\u00ed ina bhfuil ruda\u00ed faoi l\u00e1thair i gCiarra\u00ed. O mo thaith\u00ed f\u00e9in t\u00e1 s\u00e9 ana dheacair do muintir na h\u00e1ite t\u00f3gaint,\u201d she said. (\u201cI\u2019m worried. I myself would like to move back and build my own house but I don\u2019t know if I will have that chance because of the way things are at the moment in Kerry. In my own experience it\u2019s very hard for residents in the area to build.\u201d) Sinn F\u00e9in spokesperson on Spokesperson on Gaeilge, the Gaeltacht, Arts and Culture Aengus \u00d3 Snodaigh was also present at the protest today. He said that the Government must act to allow people to build houses and remain in an area where they can live their lives through Irish.

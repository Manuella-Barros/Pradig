Iga Swiatek against Aryna Sabalenka proved a point in the Madrid Open final", "body": "Feliciano Lopez, Colin Fleming and Anne Keothavong discuss the Madrid Open final between Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka\n\nIga Swiatek's victory against Aryna Sabalenka in the Madrid Open final will go down as arguably one of the greatest women's matches of the Open Era.\n\nOn the brink of defeat, Swiatek saved three championship points to win the title with an incredible three-set victory over defending champion Sabalenka in a matchup of the top two players in the world.\n\nThe contest lived up to expectations, going down as the longest encounter between the two Grand Slam champions at three hours and 11 minutes.\n\nSwiatek admitted neither player deserved to lose while Sabalenka delivered what was arguably the finest performance of her career. Yet, when the final point was played, it was world No 1 Swiatek who held the winner's trophy aloft on the confetti-drenched court.\n\n\"Who's gonna say now that women's tennis is boring?\" Swiatek said in her on-court interview with Spanish TV.\n\nDuring her press conference, the Polish star elaborated on her comment, explaining that there was a lot fans could take from the women's game.\n\n\"Well, I think, obviously if we would have to play against a man we would lose. It's not about that. It's about how two players match against each other. So I think we can play great matches,\" the 22-year-old said.\n\n\"I'm No 1, but I'm seeing these girls in the top 10, we can play such intense battles. I think it's all about what emotions it brings in people, and I think it's not that you should compare the level of tennis, but you should compare what it gives you when you watch it. I think people can take a lot from watching women's tennis, and it can be interesting and emotional.\"\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports Tennis, Britain's Billie Jean King Cup captain Anne Keothavong was in awe at what she had witnessed after the final, saying: \"The quality they were able to display for over three hours was phenomenal. That was high-quality stuff.\n\n\"It was a gutsy performance from both players.\n\n\"That was one of the best matches I've ever witnessed courtside. High-quality, high-drama\n\n\"It was a match which was tough to call, even before they went on the court. They've got a fierce rivalry and prior to the match we wondered how much Sabalenka had in the tank because pretty much every match she played in here went the distance apart from one.\n\n\"Iga showed such good fighting spirit, such desire, they were both just desperate for it. They left everything out there, which is what you want to see.\"\n\nTournament director Feliciano Lopez was amazed by the quality shown on court by Swiatek and Sabalenka, calling it an 'amazing match'.\n\nThe Spaniard said: \"Not only the longest match in the history of the tournament, but the best match as well. It was a hell of a match with everything, with drama, great tennis and also the biggest rivalry we can have in tennis for the next few years.\n\n\"It was great to be in the front row and to witness such a great match.\n\n\"Sabalenka might have been the favourite but Swiatek was hanging in there, she waited for the opportunity and I think she deserved it because she was fighting until the end.\"\n\nFormer player Colin Fleming felt Swiatek was 'brave' in saving three Championship points before taking her opportunity.\n\n\"Swiatek was hitting the ball within inches of the baseline but they were both coming up with the goods in pressure situations,\" he said. \"We loved the emotion from Swiatek. She plays as the poker face by not giving anything anyway.\"\n\nAs the road to Roland Garros, the year's second Grand Slam, continues on Swiatek's beloved clay, the world No 1 next leads the field at this week's Internazionali BNL d'Italia.\n\nThe four-time Grand Slam champion is already looking ahead to Rome with an eye on capturing her third title.\n\n\"I feel like after such a match, I deserve a two-month vacation,\" Swiatek told the official WTA website, \"but I can't have that.\n\n\"So I'll trade it for, like, six tiramisus or something.\"\n\nSky Sports' Raz Mirza\n\nSwiatek and Sabalenka delivered in every department for women's tennis on Saturday night in Madrid, showcasing the current strength of the game with established names and storylines\n\nThe top two players in the world conjured up a final for the ages, with unerring accuracy, power, pace, and a never-say-die attitude to leave fans in bewilderment at what they had just witnessed.\n\nCoco Gauff and Elena Rybakina make up the 'Big Four' in a bright new era for women's tennis.\n\nIn the run-up to the second Grand Slam of 2024 - the French Open at Roland Garros from May 26 - you can watch all of the biggest tennis stars in action live on Sky Sports as they compete across the clay-court season.\n\nStream Sky Sports live with no contract on a Month or Day membership on NOW.

It left Sabalenka, the world No 2, slumped in her chair, a towel over her head and face, the very recent memory of three championship points running through her brain.\n\nShe hadn't lost them. Swiatek had mercilessly taken them from her.\n\nThis was two days after Sabalenka had toppled Rybakina in a semi-final duel, in another third-set tiebreak that required 12 points for the Belarusian to complete her grinding comeback, 1-6, 7-5, 7-6(5). And it was two weeks after Rybakina had knocked out Swiatek in a semi-final in Stuttgart that also went three sets -- at a tournament Swiatek has owned for two years.\n\nThese women are thisclose right now, and they know it. In such rivalries, wonky measurables like who hits the more powerful forehand or finishes a higher percentage of points at the net don't determine who wins and who loses as much as intangibles. It becomes a question of who can execute the best shots on the biggest points, and lately, all three of them have done it. In 2024, the top of women's tennis is tighter than ever.\n\n\"It was more about, you know, who's going to be less stressed and who's going to be able to play with more freedom,\" Swiatek said in the aftermath of Saturday's mayhem.\n\n\"For most of the match, she played more, like, I felt like some decisions were pretty... how to say it... like, courageous. I was sometimes, you know, a little bit back. So at the end, I just wanted to not do that and to also be courageous.\"\n\nThis was that rare, special tennis where both players play at their peak at the same time, for long stretches, with a title on the line. A little while after the sting of the initial disappointment, Sabalenka knew what everyone watching did -- that she played about as good a match as she could, that nearly every point was a coin-flip, that she had been part of one of the greatest women's finals ever.\n\n\"She just played a little bit better on those key moments,\" Sabalenka said. \"That's it.\"\n\nMen's tennis went through nearly 20 years of three guys winning just about everything -- Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, with Andy Murray making it a four-way battle during a chunk of the 2010s.\n\nIf she can figure out her serve, Coco Gauff could be crashing the current three-way battle at the top before too long. She's actually world No 3, one place ahead of Rybakina, but hasn't managed to hit this trio's heights consistently since winning the U.S. Open by beating Sabalenka last September; in 2024, the other three have forged past her.\n\nIt's been a while since women's tennis had something like this.\n\nSerena Williams had some worthy adversaries over the years for certain periods -- her sister Venus, Justine Henin, Kim Clijsters, Victoria Azarenka -- but a sustained troika at the top never really evolved. Since 2017, 18 different women have won 24 Grand Slam titles. The repeat champions - Simona Halep, Naomi Osaka, Ashleigh Barty and Swiatek -- have never played the same opponent twice in a Grand Slam final.\n\nSwiatek, Rybakina and Sabalenka are also waiting on that. The only time two of them have met in a final was at the Australian Open last year, with Sabalenka prevailing over Rybakina, again in three sets, in arguably the highest-quality women's final we'd seen before Saturday in the Spanish capital.\n\nMaybe that is about to change. Judging from what happened on Saturday, and what has been happening for most of the last two years, there's a decent chance it will.\n\n\"We push each other,\" Rybakina said after her loss to Sabalenka, a match in which she was a forehand sitter in the front of the court away from likely locking it up. \"We push each other to improve.\"\n\nThis dynamic will be familiar to fans of that Big Three/Four era in the men's game, which turned into what tennis writer Matthew Willis accurately coined an ouroboros, each meeting between them, and the different stylistic and psychological battles therein, taking the players involved to greater and greater heights, further and further away from the rest of the field.\n\nThis all could last 10 minutes, or 10 years. Sabalenka, who is from Belarus but largely lives in the U.S. city of Miami, Florida, turned 26 on Sunday; Rybakina, Russian by birth, Kazakh by nationality, is 24; Swiatek, the first true great from Poland is 22. (Gauff is 20, and improving every year.)\n\nInjuries, the strain of a relentless schedule, a new crop of young talent, a back-in-form Osaka... many things could render this triangular rivalry obsolete very quickly. It may not even fully develop, with Swiatek having streaked ahead in rankings and titles, collecting 18 in a three-year period in which Sabalenka has four and Rybakina six.\n\nAt the moment though, there is something irresistible about the dynamic between these three athletes, who all bring something different onto the court at first glance, but also subtly carry many of each others' strengths.\n\nSabalenka comes with brute force and unmatched intensity, but also a quickly improving net game and the capacity to swipe a match away that she shares with Swiatek.\n\nSwiatek speeds across the court and through her matches with that frightening efficiency, displaying an innate versatility that the others are still trying to acquire -- but her prodigious topspin disguises the sheer speed and force of groundstrokes usually attributed to Sabalenka.\n\nRybakina's elegant, effortless power and at times gossamer touch make her glazed-eye calm seem less titanium than Swiatek's focus, but in reality, like her tactical nous, it is just as immovable.\n\nWhere this all goes over the next several weeks as the tour moves to Rome and then Paris for the last and biggest clay events of the year, and then shifts to Wimbledon's grass, is anyone's guess.\n\nMadrid, where the harder court and the altitude make the ball fly, figured to favor Sabalenka and Rybakina, who are power players, over Swiatek, but she remains queen of the clay. This made that title a key triumph for the Pole -- the lone big event on clay she had never won.\n\nNow tennis moves to the slower, more traditional clay courts at the Italian Open and the French Open, which she favors. She's won at Roland Garros three times in four years. That could spell trouble for her foes.\n\nThen again, Rybakina is the defending champion in Rome. Her breakout win came against Serena Williams in Paris in 2021; Sabalenka was a point away from the French Open final last year before tightening in the crucial moments. She doesn't do that very often anymore.\n\nAfter the clay, comes the grass. Swiatek is still a novice on the surface and is the first one to say so. She has said that, at some point in her career, she will dedicate more time to growing more comfortable with its speed and low bounces, but she has not done it yet.\n\nRybakina won Wimbledon in 2022. Sabalenka frittered away a lead in the semifinals there last year. Her power is a lot to handle anywhere. On grass, it can overwhelm.\n\nThen it's back to Paris and Roland Garros for the Olympics, and then on to the hard courts in North America, which should favor Sabalenka, the two-time defending champion on the Australian Open's hard courts and a U.S. Open finalist last year... though Swiatek is the only one of the three to have won at Flushing Meadows, in 2022.\n\nSwiatek, Rybakina and Sabalenka get asked about this second Big Three stuff a lot these days. Usually, they try to shrug it off. That other Big Three have won 66 Grand Slams and may not be done yet. They are on seven. There's a long way to go, but it's where they hope this is all headed.\n\n\"I'm really happy to be one of these Big Three,\" Sabalenka said Saturday night, when she had come second and was trying to grasp a silver lining.\n\n\"It's really motivating me a lot to keep working and to keep improving myself just so I stay there, and then kind of, like, you know, just be there and get as many wins against them as I can.\"\n\n(Top photos: Daniel Pockett; Quality Sport Images; Clive Brunskill/Getty Images)", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"},

Iga Swiatek, after a marathon of matches, has clinched her maiden title in the tournament. But for now, she wants to rest! And what better way to do that than to go on a long vacation? Well, Swiatek has an alternative and unusual solution.\n\nAmidst the sweat and triumph of her back-to-back matches, Iga Swiatek has now made a confession for her next goal. But it does not include winning her upcoming tournament. Rather, it's simple and relatable to all of us.\"I feel like, after such a match, I deserve, like, at least two months of vacation.\"\n\nBut how would she do it? Iga Swiatek still has the Rome Open and Roland Garros on her schedule. And apart from that, there is also the Olympics of 2024 as well. Realizing the impracticality of the situation, she further added, \"But I can't, I can't, you know, have that out.\" However, the victory should not go un-celebrated, so Swiatek has found solace by trading it with an Italian dessert. \"You know, traded for like 6 tiramisus or something.\"\n\nThis hilarious admission showcased not only her ability to find a moment of relief amid the matches but also hinted at the exhaustive tournaments that most of the players have to go through in a season. And this is especially applicable to World No. 1, Iga Swiatek, who has by far won three titles this season. One in the Qatar Open, then in the Indian Wells, and recently in the Madrid Open as well.\n\nThe 22-year-old has already bagged 20 titles in total! And so her desire to have a vacation, is understandable to us all, especially, after her intense final match with Aryna Sabalenka on Saturday. And recalling the excitement that won the hearts of all of us, Swiatek posed an important question during a post-match interview.\n\nIga Swiatek oozes confidence after a captivating tennis final match\n\nAfter a thrilling three-set tiebreaker match, Iga Swiatek avenged her 2023 defeat in the Madrid Open against Aryna Sabalenka. Although she struggled with her serve at 5-6 during the third set, Swiatek did not give up. And after a 3-hour, 11-minute battle, she became the youngest player to earn 20 titles after Caroline Wozniacki did so back in 2012. Therefore, her question after the match was, \"Who is going to say that women's tennis is boring now?\"\n\nAnd indeed, it is true. With intense matches and a display of skills, everyone was at the edge of their seats throughout the match. And shedding all the stereotypes, the clash provided a glimpse of their incredible ability to fight with all of their strength, both physically and mentally. Although there is no immediate vacation awaiting Iga Swiatek for now, we hope to see her progress in the season with determination and momentary escape amid the fiery clashes.", "source": {"uri": "essentiallysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EssentiallySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_Qatar_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WTA Qatar Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Wells_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Wells Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Wozniacki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caroline Wozniacki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023-11-07T013708Z_833952925_UP1EJB704HUC3_RTRMADP_3_TENNIS-WTAFINALS.jpg?class=watermark", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545650", "eventUri": "eng-9545650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Rybakina is the defending champion in Rome; Swiatek is looking to add to the two titles she won in 2021 and 2022; while Sabalenka is seeking her first crown at the WTA 1000 event.\n\nREAD MORE: Iga Swiatek distances herself from Aryna Sabalenka's approach as she addresses rivalry\n\nDuring her pre-tournament press conference in Rome, Sabalenka was asked if she felt the difference between the trio is determined by the playing surface.\n\n\"Well, I mean, obviously Iga is much better on clay than me, for example. I would say Elena is better on grass. I'm maybe a little bit better on hard court,\" said the Belarusian.\n\n\"At the same time, I cannot say that it's all about the surface. I mean, as the time shows, I can beat them on clay, on hard, on grass. It's not about the surface, I would say. It's about, honestly in each match, couple of key moments where, like, probably she played better.\n\n\"For example, last match with Iga, I wouldn't say on those important points I did something wrong, it's just I was doing the right thing, but she was doing it better little bit. It's just about little things.\n\n\"Yeah, it's not about the surface. It's a process. You learn from that little mistakes you made during the match, then you go and work on them, you try better next time. It's just little improvements, like little percentage better every day. Hope for the better result.\"\n\nThe world No 2 also addressed a question about her rivalry with Swiatek and whether she and the Pole were beginning to separate themselves from their other rivals.\n\n\"I don't know, it's tough to say. I mean, I'm not trying to focus on that honestly. I know we have some rivals, meaning like me, Iga and Elena. We're doing maybe more consistent, play more consistently past years. Maybe last year and this year so far,\" said Sabalenka.\n\n\"I would say that in tennis, anybody can beat anybody. If you would start thinking like, 'My level is there, they're somewhere there' - how to say - you're not respecting them, you underestimate them, and you're kind of like losing it because you're not - how to say - focusing well enough for them.\n\n\"I wouldn't say the level is that far. It's all about being focused, do your thing, not thinking about all these ranking situations, the level is higher than them.\n\n\"I'm focusing on myself and making sure that every time I'm on the court I bring my best tennis and hope that I'll still be there in that top three players, yeah. Yeah, that's it.\"", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis365.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ewan_west@tennis365.com", "name": "Ewan West", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_1000_tournaments", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WTA 1000 tournaments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hardcourt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_500_tournaments", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WTA 500 tournaments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WTA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Rybakina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elena Rybakina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://d2me2qg8dfiw8u.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2024/05/04115534/Aryna-Sabalenka-Iga-Swiatek-and-Elena-Rybakina.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545650", "eventUri": "eng-9545650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

The World No.1 added to her own lore last weekend, coming through a match-point-saving victory over No.2 Aryna Sabalenka in the final of the Mutua Madrid Open to capture her 20th career title and third of the season.\n\n\"It's pretty crazy being in Madrid, packing straightaway after the final and coming here,\" Swiatek said.\n\n\"I'm happy to be here because I love this place. I have already practiced today in the morning. It's fun. For sure it's a challenge to adapt. But it's nice to have problems like that.\"\n\nTop-seeded in Rome, Swiatek is bidding to become the first three-time champion at the Foro Italico since Serena Williams won in 2013, 2014, 2016. After a first-round bye, she will open her tournament against either No.54 Caroline Dolehide or a qualifier.\n\nSwiatek is as experienced as anyone at managing the quick turnaround between back-to-back tournaments. It helps that she is an incredible momentum player, one who seems to only get stronger as she tallies successive wins. One of the keys to Swiatek's ability to maintain her winning momentum has been extending herself grace.\n\n\"I'm not expecting myself to be fresh,\" Swiatek said. \"Truly, like when I came to Madrid, I was more tired at the beginning of the tournament after Stuttgart than I was actually before the final. It really depends how the matches are going to look like.\n\n\"I know that if I'm going to stay longer in a tournament, I might have some days off where I don't even practice. We're trying to plan it differently than last seasons because we are worried. These tournaments are longer and it's not possible to have days off before, so sometimes you have to have them during.\"\n\nThat approach worked perfectly in Madrid, where Swiatek took a full day before the Round of 16.\n\n\"I mean, my coaches are planning it,\" Swiatek said. \"No point for me to focus on that because I want to win the first matches, and we'll see what's going to happen afterwards.", "source": {"uri": "wtatennis.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Women's Tennis Association"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midnights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evermore_(Taylor_Swift_album)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evermore (Taylor Swift album)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore_(Taylor_Swift_album)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Folklore (Taylor Swift album)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Dolehide", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caroline Dolehide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foro_Italico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foro Italico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://photoresources.wtatennis.com/photo-resources/2024/05/07/4ca31334-19ca-479f-943a-c48921d63f62/Iga_Swiatek_-_Internazionali_BNL_D_Italia_2024_-_Day_1-DSC_7348.jpg?width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545650", "eventUri": "eng-9545650", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

But over the past two seasons, a strong group of elite players has emerged.\n\nAnd that was even more evident on Saturday, after a truly epic Madrid Open final between world No. 1 Iga Swiatek and No. 2 Aryna Sabalenka, cementing their collective dominance in the sport and their ability to bring out the best in one another's games.\n\nIn a rematch of the 2023 final, the two battled and pushed one another to the brink for well over three hours, trading winners and celebratory screams, and ultimately needing a third-set tiebreak to determine the champion. Swiatek, the three-time French Open champion, took the first set, but Sabalenka -- who won last year's title -- stormed back to force a decider.\n\nAnd what followed in the final set was a pure battle of wills and jaw-dropping moments with neither player ready to concede.\n\nWith Sabalenka just seconds away from successfully defending her title, Swiatek saved two match points at 5-6 in the third set and ultimately forced the tiebreak. Facing yet another match point in the breaker, Swiatek found a way to remain in the match and then win 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (7). When it was finally over, Swiatek collapsed onto the ground in what appeared to be a mix of elation and relief. She later called it the \"most intense and crazy final\" she had ever played.\n\n\"Who is going to say that women's tennis is boring now, right?\" Swiatek said moments later in an on-court interview. \"Congrats as well to Aryna because we both had an amazing effort today.\"\n\nThe victory marked the 20th career title for the 22-year-old Swiatek. She is the youngest WTA player to achieve the milestone since Caroline Wozniacki in 2012, and the first player -- male or female -- born in this millennium to do so. Swiatek has now won nine 1000-level titles, trailing just Victoria Azarenka for most among active players. Saturday also gave Swiatek a 7-3 career edge over Sabalenka -- but it seems certain we'll see much more of this rivalry.\n\nHere's what else you might have missed from Madrid and around the tennis world last week:\n\nAndrey Rublev arrived in Madrid on a four-match losing streak, without a win on clay this season. He struggled with symptoms from an illness as the tournament got underway, later saying it made him \"almost dead every day,\" and he was unable to sleep.\n\nDespite everything, the 26-year-old played his best tennis of the season in Madrid, beating three seeded players en route to the final, including in a comeback against No. 2 seed Carlos Alcaraz 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, in the quarterfinals. On Sunday in the final, he rallied yet again after dropping the first set for a 4-6, 7-5, 7-5 victory over Felix Auger-Aliassime. Like Swiatek, he fell to the ground in celebration at the match's conclusion.\n\nIt was the 16th ATP title for Rublev, and second of 2024 and at the Masters 1000-level. But while winning certainly isn't new for him, he said Madrid was the \"most proud title\" of his career.\n\n\"I have no words,\" Rublev said. \"If you knew what I had been through in the past nine days you would not imagine that I would be able to win a title.\"\n\nWith the win, Rublev improved two spots in the rankings and is now at No. 6.\n\nEntering Madrid, Sebastian Korda and Jordan Thompson had never shared the court at an ATP event. Never in singles, and certainly never as a doubles team. But the American-Australian pair won the title together.\n\nThe two used one of the ATP's newly created spots in the doubles draws for primarily singles players and rolled through the draw. They recorded impressive wins over more-established teams, including Jamie Murray and Michael Venus in the semifinals. On Saturday, Korda and Thompson defeated Ariel Behar and Adam Pavlasek 6-3, 7-6 (7) for the first 1000-level trophy for either player. It marked Thompson's sixth ATP doubles title, but the first for Korda and his second overall title on tour.\n\nAccording to Thompson, he wasn't even sure if he was going to be able to play after injuring himself in practice ahead of the final, but ultimately decided he was OK.\n\n\"He hit too good of a return and I just smoked myself in the head,\" Thompson said. \"I thought I was heading for the ER. It wasn't that bad. A bit of a headache, but not bad. [The trophy] will help smooth things out.\"\n\nClearly happy with how things went in their debut, the two are slated to play together again in Rome this week.\n\nOn the women's side, Cristina Bucsa and Sara Sorribes Tormo also played together for the first time -- signing up for the draw just 15 minutes before the deadline closed because both of their regular partners were unavailable -- and emerged victorious.\n\nIn the final on Sunday, the pair defeated Barbora Krejcikova and Laura Siegemund 6-0, 6-2, and became the first Spanish women in the tournament's history to win the doubles title.\n\n\"Wow, that's amazing,\" Bucsa said about their accomplishment. \"I didn't expect that. I didn't know that we can make history, but finally, the wish came true.\"\n\nAfter winning his first three matches -- including against Alex de Minaur in the second round for his first top-20 victory since 2022 -- Rafael Nadal was defeated in the Round of 16 in Madrid. And while the final result was obviously not what he had wanted during his presumed final appearance at the tournament in his home country, Nadal was still given the ultimate hero's farewell after his loss to Jiri Lehecka in straight sets.\n\nNadal, a five-time Madrid champion, was presented with a trophy, commemorating all he had achieved at the tournament during his career, and a series of banners were unfurled from the rafters. A tribute video was shown. He then addressed the crowd -- which included his wife and their young son, as well as his parents and sister -- and everyone in attendance stood on their feet.\n\n\"All I can say is that I'm grateful,\" Nadal said in Spanish. \"It's been an incredible journey that started when I was very small ... Since I first played until now there's been nothing but unconditional love and support from everyone here in Madrid. All I can say is thank you, and I'm very, very grateful.\"\n\nAnd perhaps no moment was more emotional than when he left the court as the crowd cheered him one last time.\n\nNadal is next slated to play this week at the Italian Open, before playing at the French Open later this month.\n\nNadal isn't the only player who will be making his final appearance at the French Open this year. Alize Cornet, a six-time champion on the WTA Tour, announced she would be retiring from the sport following Roland Garros -- 19 years after making her major debut at the event.\n\nThe 34-year-old French woman holds the record for most consecutive Grand Slam appearances (68) and reached her first -- and potentially only -- major quarterfinals at the 2022 Australian Open in her 63rd Grand Slam. She is well known for her giant-slaying upsets, including over then-No. 1 Serena Williams at Wimbledon in 2014, and against No. 1 Swiatek in 2022, ending Swiatek's 37-match win streak that year.\n\nCornet first revealed her decision to walk away from tennis in an interview in French with CANAL+, but later took to social media with a video in English.\n\n\"Somehow it's been really complicated to play with this in the back of my mind for the past few months, because even though I feel like the time is right and I couldn't dream of a better way to say goodbye, my heart feels heavy of leaving 19 years of my life behind me,\" Cornet said. \"But I also know that many exciting things are ahead of me and that I will be able to turn that page, knowing that I gave everything to my sport from the very beginning to the very end. I am proud of this, and I hope you guys will miss me a little bit. I will definitely miss you.\"\n\nAnd while he won't be walking away quite as soon, former world No. 8 Diego Schwartzman also just announced his impending retirement. On Sunday, the 31-year-old said 2024 would be his final full season on tour, and that he was planning on playing in his final event in his native Argentina in February.\n\n\"Every corner of the court, every second training, every point competing, every moment I was immensely happy,\" Schwartzman, a 2020 French Open semifinalist, wrote in a lengthy Instagram post. \"I lived it so intensely that today it's hard for me to keep up. All those beautiful moments have become something that carries weight today and I find it hard to keep enjoying fully ... Inside me, a competitive animal prevents me from enjoying, playing and traveling like I used to. I want my last tournaments to be my own decision.\"\n\nSchwartzman has four career titles, most recently at the Argentina Open in 2021, but he has struggled recently and hasn't won a tour-level match this season. He is currently ranked No. 142 in the world.\n\nAt this point in her legendary life and career, there's very little that Billie Jean King hasn't done. She won 39 total major titles, including 12 in singles, been perhaps the most vocal advocate for gender pay equity in sports and been given just about every award and distinction one could win. However, it turns out there was something she hadn't yet done.\n\nOn Thursday, it was announced that the 80-year-old would be appearing on the cover of a limited-edition Wheaties box.\n\n\"Having dedicated my life to fighting for equality and changing the face and future of women's sports, being one of the Wheaties champions is a dream come true,\" King said in a video posted on social media. \"It is truly an honor to be recognized for my work on and off the tennis court.\"\n\nRetired German tennis player and tennis analyst Andrea Petkovic wrote a candid, and often hilarious, review of \"Challengers,\" the new Zendaya-led tennis movie, for The Guardian.\n\nPetkovic, the former world No. 9 who retired in 2022, admitted she was nervous before watching the movie and was traumatized by previous attempts at tennis movies (see: \"Wimbledon\"). But she \"loved\" the film and was impressed by how many tennis-specific details it got right.\n\n\"I have always liked [director Luca] Guadagnino's movies and I was worried when I heard he was set on making a tennis one,\" Petkovic wrote. \"But he has pulled it off. I would venture as far as to call it genius. Only people who have spent decades around tennis, whether as a player or coach, an official or a fan, know the secrets the sport reveals when you're crazy enough to stick with it. Every win comes with a loss and every loss comes with a win...\n\n\"It's not the best movie I have ever seen. But it is the best tennis movie. Maybe even the best sports movie. Sorry, Moneyball.\"\n\nIf that doesn't convince you to see it, perhaps nothing will.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Swiatek's only opening-round loss in Rome came in her 2020 tournament debut, where she fell to Arantxa Rus.\n\nHere are more facts and figures surrounding the world's top-ranked player's latest win:\n\n7: With her second-round victory (after a first-round bye), Swiatek has now won seven straight matches on tour. Swiatek is coming off her first Mutua Madrid Open title, which she won on Saturday in a classic clash against World No.2 Aryna Sabalenka, saving three championship points.\n\n31: Swiatek now edges ahead of Elena Rybakina as this year's match-win leader, with 31 victories in 2024. Rybakina will aim to tie that number when she kicks off her Rome title defense on Friday.\n\n0-3: Former Top 30 player Pera falls to 0-3 against reigning World No.1 players, having also suffered losses to Ashleigh Barty at 2021 Roland Garros and Swiatek at 2023 Madrid. Pera's career-best win by ranking is a victory over then-No.2 Anett Kontaveit on the way to her title at 2022 Hamburg.\n\n3-0: In the third round, Swiatek will take on resurgent Yulia Putintseva, who continued her strong spring by ousting Sloane Stephens, the 2017 US Open champion and No.31 seed, 6-3, 6-2. Swiatek is 3-0 against Putintseva, including a win at Indian Wells this year.\n\nStill, Putintseva has been incredible at the last three WTA 1000 events: Indian Wells Round of 16, Miami quarterfinals, and Madrid quarterfinals. Putintseva has nearly halved her ranking from No.80 to No.41 over the past two months.", "source": {"uri": "wtatennis.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Women's Tennis Association"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arantxa_Rus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arantxa Rus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernarda_Pera", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bernarda Pera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Rybakina", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elena Rybakina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_1000_tournaments", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WTA 1000 tournaments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashleigh_Barty", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashleigh Barty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anett_Kontaveit", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anett Kontaveit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Wells_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Wells Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yulia_Putintseva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yulia Putintseva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloane_Stephens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sloane Stephens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://photoresources.wtatennis.com/photo-resources/2024/05/09/cd305361-11b4-43be-92c3-7da5fa2f6d8f/Iga_Swiatek_-_Internazionali_BNL_D_Italia_2024_-_Day_3-DSC_2675A.jpg?width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545650", "eventUri": "eng-9545650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Despite it being such a hard feat to achieve, there is an air of certainty around Swiatek accomplishing it, largely due to her dominance on clay courts.\n\nIga Swiatek's record on the clay court\n\nIga Swiatek is at her best on the clay court. The Polish star has achieved incredible success on the surface at the young age of 22 and her record is the best among current WTA players.\n\nSwiatek has her best win percentage on clay, as she has won 86.16% of her matches on the surface. This win rate has also resulted in titles for the 22-year-old as she has already won eight tournaments on European clay, including the recent 2024 Madrid Open and three French Open titles.\n\nSince 2022, Swiatek has won 45 matches while losing just four during the clay season.\n\nHer record at the French Open is even more impressive when you compare it with Rafael Nadal. The Spanish star had won four French Open titles at the age of 22 and Swiatek could match that feat with a title win at Roland Garros 2024.\n\nSwiatek has won 25 of her last 26 matches at the French Open, including three title wins in four years. With her dominance showing no signs of slowing down, the Pole will be the player to beat again at Roland Garros.\n\nIga Swiatek will start the French Open 2024 as the favourite to do the 'three-peat'\n\nWith history on her side and formidable current form, Iga Swiatek will start as the heavy favourite to win the French Open. The three-time champion in Paris is fresh off a successful outing, having won the Madrid Open for the first time.\n\nSwiatek's game is perfectly suited for the clay court as she thrives on longer rallies and likes to dominate from the baseline. Also, her natural ability to slide helps her dictate the game from anywhere on the court. That and her incredible forehand have made the Pole one of the best clay court players in the world.\n\nOnly Swiatek has dominated clay court tennis as much as the great Rafael Nadal has in recent history. The Spanish player has achieved unparalleled success on the clay surfaces of Roland Garros. However, with his apparent retirement, Swiatek may be poised to take over as the new clay court specialist.\n\nAryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina are her only real threats going into Roland Garros. She will thus be confident of achieving a historic fourth title at the French Open to move past Serena Williams, who has three.\n\nIf Swiatek does manage to win the French Open, it will not just be another Grand Slam title in her kitty but also the potential start of a legacy on the clay courts of Roland Garros.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "atharva_upasani@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Atharva Upasani", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Seles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monica Seles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Henin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justine Henin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Tennis_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's Tennis Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Rybakina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elena Rybakina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling_Compounds", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling Compounds", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/f5b2f-17152540557375-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545650", "eventUri": "eng-9545650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.584313725490196, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The Belarusian tennis player has grown above all on a mental level, in her ability to manage moments and defeats. Maturation completed the last year.\n\n\"I'm still emotional. The last time I lost, in the final in Madrid, I destroyed a racket, that's how emotional I am. Even when I was a child I cried, I was angry. There were many different emotions. What I learned about the past is just the momentum. Yes, now you have lost, but you have thousands of opportunities to win. You have to accept defeat and move forward, work and try to improve next time. If you get to those stages, the last stages of the tournaments, it's impossible to win them all. Sometimes you just need to lose to learn something. Then maybe in bigger tournaments or more important ones, you will remember the lesson and do better in the final. It's all a process,\" she expained.\n\nAfter the efforts in Madrid and the defeat in the spectacular final against Iga Swiatek, Sabalenka immediately overcame the disappointment, celebrating her 26th birthday and flying to Rome for the next seasonal match. Another tournament in which to give life to further chapters of the three-way rivalry with Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina, currently the dominators of the WTA Tour. In the last edition, Sabalenka surrendered against Sofia Kenin and, this year, the objective is certainly that to do better. At the press conference, the Belarusian commented on the Madrid final and her growth on clay, also speaking about her relationship with Swiatek. The two-time Slam champion analyzed the spectacular final act of the tournament in the Spanish capital.\n\n\"There are a lot of positives from Madrid. I recovered. I found my game again. I got everything back on track and started playing at a high level. I fought a couple of very tough battles against high-level players and got some victories.\n\nI was close to winning another title. But it happened the way it happened. Obviously Iga is much better than me on clay, for example. I would say Elena is better on grass. Maybe I'm a little better on hard. At the same time I can't say that it's all about the surface. As time shows, I can beat them on clay, on hard, on grass. It's honestly a couple of key moments in each game where they probably played better. You learn from the little mistakes you made during the match, then you work on them and try to improve,\" she told.\n\nSpeaking about the rivalry with Swiated, Sabalenka said: \"Maybe we are more consistent, we are playing more consistently than the others in the last two years. But I would say that in tennis anyone can beat anyone. The important thing is to be focused, do your own thing, not think about all these ranking situations. I focus on myself and make sure that every time I step on the court I give my best and I hope to still be among the top three players.\"", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lorenzo_ciotti@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Lorenzo Ciotti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WTA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia_Kenin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sofia Kenin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Rybakina", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elena Rybakina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image148544.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545650", "eventUri": "eng-9545650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Since the start of 2024, players have complained less about the constant ball changes but the complaints about a very long and demanding schedule remain the same.\n\nAt this past Madrid Open, the men's event was ravaged by injuries and that led to people questioning why it was the case.\n\n\"Well, I think overall, sport is more demanding because we play faster. I mean, on the other hand we're really focused on getting our physicality better,\" Swiatek explained.\n\n\"Sometimes you have more prevention because of that. On the other hand, everybody is stronger. Everybody is moving little bit better. It's also harder to win matches.\"\n\nIn Madrid, a couple of players - including Elena Rybakina and Caroline Garcia - spoke out against the new two-week format. When making their points, Rybakina and Garcia pretty much suggested that there was no need for Madrid to be a two-week tournaments and that it wasn't benefiting the players at all.\n\nAddresing the number of injuries that occured in the Madrid men's event, 2024 Madrid champion Swiatek acknowledged she didn't have a clear answer to why that was the case but explained what may have been the reason.\n\n\"It's hard for me to compare ATP tennis on clay and hard. I'm not that kind of specialist actually in terms of analyzing to know why they have injuries now. Maybe on the other hand it's just a coincidence that it happened only couple of days.

Playing against top-seeded Swiatek, Sabalenka came inches away from winning their thriller final but ultimately fell just short after the Pole saved three championship points to outlast the Belarusian 7-5 4-6 7-6 (7) in over three hours of play.\n\nIn the third set, Sabalenka opened an early 3-1 lead - Swiatek managed to get the break back - but the Belarusian had two match points on the Pole's serve in the 12th game. After failing to convert any of her two match points in the 12th game of the third set, Sabalenka missed out on another match point in the tie-break before Swiatek realized her second match point.\n\nMoments after the final ended, Sabalenka evidently looked disappointed - but who wouldn't be after losing a WTA 1000 final in such a way.\n\n\"There is lots of positives from Madrid. I fought back, I found my game. I bring everything back together and start playing on high level. I fought couple of really tough battles against top players there and I got some wins.

Now we have to recover and adapt to the playing courts, which are a little different, slower. The season is very tight, the tournaments are very close together, so we have to adapt,\" she explained.\n\nA few days after her first historic success at the Mutua Madrid Open, Swiatek retraced the phases that led to her success. The 4-time Slam champion expressed about her ambitions in view of Rome, WTA 1000 in which she will play the second round (after a bye) in a few days.\n\n\"The victory of this great tournament will leave me with a great lesson. It can teach me a lot for the rest of my career, but that's not crucial. It's important, but even if something worked today, it doesn't mean it will work tomorrow. The important thing is to hope and believe that you can improve your tennis,\" she told.\n\nThe WTA No.1 then also talked about Aryna Sabalenka, with whom she has had a very heated rivalry on the court for some time.\n\n\"I don't think about Aryna when I train, but I know that the competition is great and that if I stopped for a moment, I would be out. You have to keep improving and stay motivated,\" she explained.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lorenzo_ciotti@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Lorenzo Ciotti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Tennis_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's Tennis Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_1000_tournaments", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WTA 1000 tournaments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image148327.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545650", "eventUri": "eng-9545650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

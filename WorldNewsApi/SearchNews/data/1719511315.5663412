Dakuku said medical laboratory scientists occupied a strategic place in the effective detection, diagnosis, and response to diseases. He stressed that those were key to combating \u201cemerging infectious diseases, like COVID-19, longstanding scourges, such as tuberculosis and malaria, and the growing burden of antimicrobial resistance\u201d. The former House of Representatives member made the assertions in a speech to open the 18th Annual Lecture and National Executive Council Meeting (NEC) of the Association of Medical Laboratory Scientists of Nigeria (AMLSN), which took place recently in Akakiliki, the Ebonyi State capital. Speaking to the theme of the lecture, \u201cMitigating intractable disease outbreaks through strengthened medical laboratory services,\u201d Dakuku, who was chairman of the occasion, said the challenge of intractable diseases required the concerted action of professionals \u201cto find new ways to work together more effectively in pursuit of our determination to solve humanity\u2019s most significant health challenge. And reflect on whether we should invest enough in research, education, and laboratory investigations to find the root causes and possible solutions to these rare health occurrences\u201d. The lecture covered topics, like strengthening laboratory infrastructure and capacity, leveraging technology and innovation, ensuring quality and standardisation, fostering collaboration and partnerships, and investing in research and development. Dakuku expressed hope that the outcome of the meeting would help in efforts to alleviate intractable disease outbreaks. He commended the Ebonyi State governor, Francis Nwifuru, who was the guest lecturer and Special Guest of Honour, for his \u201cearly signs of promise\u201d in terms of \u201csignificant strides, bold statements, and revolutionary steps in healthcare and also infrastructure\u201d. Dakuku also extolled AMLSN for bringing healthcare issues to the forefront of the national discourse. In his address at the event, Ebonyi State Chairman of AMLSN, Dr. Emmanuel Okeh, enumerated some of the achievements of the governor in the healthcare sector to include procurement of 20 brand new ambulances for public health institutions in the state; upgrade and comprehensive renovation of 15 new general hospitals; and hiring of 200 medical doctors, in addition to nurses, pharmacists, and medical laboratory scientists for the state\u2019s health system. Okeh listed other feats by Nwifuru, who will be marking his first anniversary on May 29, as \u2060purchase and distribution of Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) to all medical doctors in the state; acquisition of new set of medical and radiology equipment for health facilities in the state; setting up of intensive care unit; \u2060award of over 200 overseas scholarships to medical personnel in the state to pursue post-graduate studies; and \u2060approval for purchase of vaccines.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"691\" height=\"465\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Dakuku-Peterside-1b-e1710590351285.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" /></div>Former Director-General of Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr. Dakuku Peterside, has emphasised the role of medical laboratory science in the attempt to combat intractable diseases and health care delivery in the country.

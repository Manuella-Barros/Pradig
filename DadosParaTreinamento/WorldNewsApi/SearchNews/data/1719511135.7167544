But that\u2019s not the case for these six Boston students from different high schools vying for a $10,000 scholastic scholarship. On Wednesday night, an award ceremony began like any other, with six students wondering which among them would win a $10,000 scholarship for their academic achievements to help with their college costs, according to WCVB. Julie Cyprien of East Boston High School ultimately won the prize, but that wasn\u2019t the end of the scholarship story. An anonymous benefactor donated an additional $50,000 to Boston Public Schools allowing each of the finalists to go home with their own $10,000 scholarship, according to the news station. \u201cMy dream is to one day become a judge, so go to law school, be a lawyer and then I would like to be on the Supreme Court,\u201d Cyprien told WCVB. Cyprien plans to attend Salem State University and later Suffolk University Law School. Abul Azan of the Boston International Newcomers Academy is considering his options between Wentworth Institute of Technology and UMass Boston, according to news reports. \u201cNow, I can start applying for any research opportunities because I want to be a scientist,\u201d said YiYang Zhong who is headed to UMass Amherst from Boston Green Academy, told WCVB. \u201cThis is going to make going to college a lot easier and a lot less of a burden on my parents, as well,\u201d Mari Baker, who will be attending Northeastern University for architecture in the fall from the Boston Latin School, told the news station. Ana Tran from Boston Latin Academy is considering giving part of her $10,000 back to the community as well as toward her own college tuition. Tran is passionate about volunteering, she told WCVB. Valquiria Tavares Monteiro of Burke High School said she\u2019ll be studying child psychology as that is something she\u2019s struggled with in the past, according to the news station. \u201cAll of who are just so representative of the brilliance, beauty and the talent that we have,\u201d said BPS superintendent Mary Skipper, according to WCVB.", "summary": "<p>The benefactor donated an additional $50,000 to Boston Public Schools, allowing each finalist to take home a $10,000 scholarship.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/05/26/6-boston-students-vying-for-10k-scholarship-all-go-home-happy-thanks-to-anonymous-benefactor/\">6 Boston students vying for $10K scholarship all go home happy, thanks to anonymous benefactor</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.boston.com\">Boston.com</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/05/26/6-boston-students-vying-for-10k-scholarship-all-go-home-happy-thanks-to-anonymous-benefactor/", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/BDC_Logo_2020_256x256-60d0abc34135e.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:26:13", "author": "Rosemary Ford", "authors": ["Rosemary Ford"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.322}

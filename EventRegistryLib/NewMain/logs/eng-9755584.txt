Buyers? Something in the middle?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir decision on which exact way they choose to pivot might not yet be etched in stone. The Rangers' four-game series vs. the Chicago White Sox at Globe Life Field -- which, when it concludes on Thursday, will see the Rangers' five days away from the July 30 deadline -- may provide clarity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdeally.\n\nRangers\n\nBe the smartest Rangers fan. Get the latest news.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nA come-from-behind, walk-off win in a night where even the Rangers' most reliable cog failed can move the needle in one direction. The Rangers -- who trailed through eight-and-a-half innings after All-Star closer Kirby Yates allowed a go-ahead home run to Chicago's Paul DeJong in the top of the ninth inning -- tied Monday's game in the bottom ninth by way of a run-scoring Jonah Heim single, then walked it off in the 10th when rookie Wyatt Langford mashed a Steven Wilson sweeper to the wall in left field with the bases loaded to give the Rangers a 4-3 win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA decisive week got off to a bad start.\n\nBecause, make no mistake about it, the Rangers are in the midst of a decisive week.\n\n\"I think,\" general manager Chris Young said Monday afternoon during an appearance on 105.3 The Fan. \"this is a very important series for us in determining where we stand and what we can become as a team.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterpret that how you'd like, but, it's two-fold messaging. The Rangers began play Monday five games back of the Houston Astros -- the same team that they took two of three from to close the first half -- and the Seattle Mariners for first place in the American League West standings. Houston plays the last-place Oakland Athletics this week; Seattle has the fourth-place Los Angeles Angels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTexas can only worry about itself, though the way in which Seattle lost a 10-game division in less that a month reflects how quickly thing can change within a division that's played as the league's weakest. A series win (or, in their most-perfect world, a series sweep) theoretically allows the Rangers to either make up ground or tread water in the division before a three-game series against the Toronto Blue Jays that starts Friday.\n\nThere's another side to what this series could mean for the Rangers, their self perception and the perception of those who may want to deal with them before next Tuesday.\n\nThe White Sox are cellar dwellers. Real life cellar dwellers might even take offense at that. They began play Monday with a league-worst 27-74 record and a staggering 33.5 game deficit in their own division. They're on pace to win just 43 games, the ninth-fewest in the modern era. They've scored the fewest runs in baseball (316) by a not-all-that-insignificant amount. Their relevance on the national scene is only that of a team with parts to sell off between now and next Tuesday.\n\nThey're the type of team that one with hopes of contention shouldn't struggle against. Young said on 105.3 The Fan that Texas' series finale win vs. the first-place Baltimore Orioles on Sunday served as proof that the Rangers \"can compete with the best teams in the league.\" The series first two games -- which Baltimore won by a combined score of 17-5 -- suggests that a gap still exists between the Rangers and teams of that ilk. A slip-up vs. Chicago may say more about the state of the Rangers than a successful series would.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What I'd like to see really is us come out here and play really good baseball get hot, win four or five in a row and make the decision for us,\" Young said during his radio appearance. \"Make it very clear that this is a team that can compete into August and September. If we do that, and I say this wholeheartedly, I believe we can.\"\n\nFanGraphs' projection system gives the Rangers a 10.5% chance to make the playoffs but just a 4% chance to clinch a Wild Card bid. Only five teams in the American League are given shorter percentages to reach the postseason, and two -- the White Sox and the Oakland Athletics -- can be decidedly classified as noncompetitors.\n\nThe Rangers aren't bottom feeders. It might take some deadline fortitude to solidify them as legitimate contenders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMonday's start tipped the scale in one direction.\n\nThe rest of the week could flip it over.\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreWatch: Wyatt Langford delivers for Texas Rangers with walk-off hit in extra inningsWatch: Texas Rangers manager Bruce Bochy ejected for fourth time this seasonWill the Texas Rangers be sellers?

Get the latest news.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nFirst and foremost on that list is Garc\u00eda, who put together his first multi-hit game since June 29.\n\n2024 has been a well-documented struggle for last season's ALCS MVP. His OPS is down over 150 points from 2023, and his power numbers, especially recently, have diminished, with just one home run in the month of July.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGarc\u00eda, however, doubled home the game-tying run with his third hit of the game in the fifth inning, then came around to score to give the Rangers a lead they wouldn't lose.\n\nSeager hasn't struggled nearly as much as Garc\u00eda, but he hasn't replicated his MVP runner-up numbers from last season and was mired in a 1-for-19 post-All-Star break slump entering the night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe supplied the first run of the game for Texas, a solo home run that screamed off the bat at 109.7 mph to give the Rangers an early lead. He also supplied three other hits, tying a career-high with four. It's the second time he's done that this season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEovaldi, meanwhile, has spent another season successfully anchoring the Rangers rotation and has steadied himself since coming off the injured list at the end of May, but his last start was one of the worst of his year thus far. The Orioles beat him up for six runs in five innings in a July 19 loss.\n\nWednesday, though, he was the team's ace again, becoming the third Rangers starter to strike out double-digit batters this season and limiting the White Sox to two runs across seven innings.\n\nAdd more contributions from this year's breakout star Josh Smith (2-for-4, two RBIs), and it equates to a fourth-straight win for Texas.\n\nThe victory, which comes on a day when the Seattle Mariners dropped another game to the Angels (the sixth straight time they've fallen vs. LA) and the Houston Astros beat the Oakland A's, puts the Rangers at two games behind second-place Seattle and three behind first-place Houston.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Rangers close out their series with the White Sox on Thursday before heading to Toronto to face the Blue Jays and their 46-55 record.\n\nIt's a chance for the Rangers to pull even closer to first place in the West, five days from the MLB's trade deadline.\n\nIt's also a chance for the Rangers, and some of their bigger-name players, to get back to the success of 2023.\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreBruce Bochy believes winning close games 'breeds confidence' for Texas

Buyers? Something in the middle?\n\nTheir decision on which exact way they choose to pivot might not yet be etched in stone. The Rangers' four-game series vs. the Chicago White Sox at Globe Life Field -- which, when it concludes on Thursday, will see the Rangers' five days away from the July 30 deadline -- may provide clarity.\n\nIdeally.\n\nA come-from-behind, walk-off win in a night where even the Rangers' most reliable cog failed can move the needle in one direction. The Rangers -- who trailed through eight-and-a-half innings after All-Star closer Kirby Yates allowed a go-ahead home run to Chicago's Paul DeJong in the top of the ninth inning -- tied Monday's game in the bottom ninth by way of a run-scoring Jonah Heim single, then walked it off in the 10th when rookie Wyatt Langford mashed a Steven Wilson sweeper to the wall in left field with the bases loaded to give the Rangers a 4-3 win.\n\nA decisive week got off to a bad start.\n\nBecause, make no mistake about it, the Rangers are in the midst of a decisive week.\n\n\"I think,\" general manager Chris Young said Monday afternoon during an appearance on 105.3 The Fan. \"This is a very important series for us in determining where we stand and what we can become as a team.\"\n\nInterpret that how you'd like, but, it's two-fold messaging. The Rangers began play Monday five games back of the Houston Astros -- the same team that they took two of three from to close the first half -- and the Seattle Mariners for first place in the American League West standings. Houston plays the last-place Oakland Athletics this week; Seattle has the fourth-place Los Angeles Angels.\n\nTexas can only worry about itself, though the way in which Seattle lost a 10-game division in less that a month reflects how quickly thing can change within a division that's played as the league's weakest. A series win (or, in their most-perfect world, a series sweep) theoretically allows the Rangers to either make up ground or tread water in the division before a three-game series against the Toronto Blue Jays that starts Friday.\n\nThere's another side to what this series could mean for the Rangers, their self perception and the perception of those who may want to deal with them before next Tuesday.\n\nThe White Sox are cellar dwellers. Real life cellar dwellers might even take offense at that. They began play Monday with a league-worst 27-74 record and a staggering 33.5 game deficit in their own division. They're on pace to win just 43 games, the ninth-fewest in the modern era. They've scored the fewest runs in baseball (316) by a not-all-that-insignificant amount. Their relevance on the national scene is only that of a team with parts to sell off between now and next Tuesday.\n\nThey're the type of team that one with hopes of contention shouldn't struggle against. Young said on 105.3 The Fan that Texas' series finale win vs. the first-place Baltimore Orioles on Sunday served as proof that the Rangers \"can compete with the best teams in the league.\" The series first two games -- which Baltimore won by a combined score of 17-5 -- suggests that a gap still exists between the Rangers and teams of that ilk. A slip-up vs. Chicago may say more about the state of the Rangers than a successful series would.\n\n\"What I'd like to see really is us come out here and play really good baseball get hot, win four or five in a row and make the decision for us,\" Young said during his radio appearance. \"Make it very clear that this is a team that can compete into August and September. If we do that, and I say this wholeheartedly, I believe we can.\"\n\nFanGraphs' projection system gives the Rangers a 10.5% chance to make the playoffs but just a 4% chance to clinch a wild-card bid. Only five teams in the American League are given shorter percentages to reach the postseason, and two -- the White Sox and the Oakland Athletics -- can be decidedly classified as noncompetitors.\n\nThe Rangers aren't bottom feeders. It might take some deadline fortitude to solidify them as legitimate contenders.\n\nMonday's start tipped the scale in one direction.\n\nThe rest of the week could flip it over.\n\n\u00a92024 The Dallas Morning News.

This has allowed the Rangers to stay in the postseason race even with their own injuries and poor play.\n\n\"The Mariners' midseason fade not only gave the Houston Astros a chance to rebound from their 7-19 start, but also figures to end any possibility of the Texas Rangers becoming an outright seller,\" Rosenthal said on Wednesday.\n\nThe reigning World Series champions have a 49-52 record and are currently 3.5 games back of first place in the AL West and 6.5 games back of the third AL Wild Card position.\n\nThird baseman Josh Jung, left fielder Evan Carter and pitchers Dane Dunning, Cody Bradford, Tyler Mahle and Jacob deGrom are all expected to be coming back from injuries soon and will provide the Rangers a significant boost.\n\nOne option Rosenthal presents is that with so many starting pitchers returning from injury, the Rangers could trade one of them to either bolster their bullpen or add a bat, most likely a center fielder to try and get an upgrade over Leody Taveras.\n\nWhich pitcher would the Rangers make available?\n\nRosenthal suggested that that the Rangers would likely try and move Michael Lorenzen and Jon Gray, especially if they do not anticipate featuring them in a potential postseason rotation.\n\nAs of now, the Rangers postseason rotation, if they make it, would most likely feature Nathan Eovaldi, Andrew Heaney, Max Scherzer and deGrom, making Lorenzen and Gray expendable.\n\nBecause the Rangers are appearing to go all in, Eovaldi is not expected to be traded according to Rosenthal. Eovaldi is one of the premier postseason pitchers, playing a key role on last seasons World Series team and the 2018 World Series champion Red Sox. Heaney, who signed a player option this offseason, is also expected to remain with the Rangers. Scherzer, who has a no-trade clause in his contract, recently said that he would not be waiving it and would like to remain with the Rangers.\n\nThe trade deadline is in less than a week.

Going into Wednesday's game with the Chicago White Sox, they are only three games out of the lead.\n\nSo, which way will Texas go? The club may not know until the last minute.\n\nIf the Rangers decide to sell, ESPN writes, it will be more of a retool than a rebuild. Players that could be on the move include pitchers Nathan Eovaldi, David Robertson and Kirby Yates. Veteran outfielder Robbie Grossman could be on the block.\n\nThey all have something in common -- they're on expiring contracts, though Eovaldi's has a vesting option for 2025 based on innings pitched the past two seasons.\n\nThe last name on ESPN's list was a curious inclusion and one that might surprise Rangers fans -- outfielder Adolis Garc\u00eda.\n\nHe's loved by Rangers fans after his performance in the postseason a year ago, which included earning American League Championship Series MVP honors. He had the best season of his career offensively and won his first Gold Glove in right field.\n\nThis season has been a rough one for him and he's not the only Rangers hitter dealing with a slump at the plate. But his has become pronounced. He entered Tuesday's game with a .205 batting average with 17 home runs and 46 RBI.\n\nIn July he was batting just .123 and was 1-for-23 in his past 24 at-bats, even though had reached base via hit or walk in 23 of his last 26 games.\n\nIt's hard to believe but at one point this season he was batting .294. He's still among the team leaders in extra-base hits, home runs, runs and RBI. He's also been durable. He's missed just one game. He started the season red-hot, slashing .292/.347/.585/.932 with eight home runs and 25 RBI in March and April.\n\nTwo things might interest teams in Garc\u00eda, if the Rangers chose to move him. First, despite his average, he can still slug. Second, he is under a team-friendly deal through 2025, a two-year, $14 million deal he signed in the offseason. Plus, he can't be a free agent until 2027. A new team would have some control over his future.\n\nThe questions is, with how much Garcia has struggled in 2024, would the Rangers receive much in return?\n\nOnce the Rangers choose, things could happen fast. They might have to be bowled over to move Garc\u00eda, but it's possible.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolis_Garc\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adolis Garc\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globe_Life_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Globe Life Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Run_Derby_(Major_League_Baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home Run Derby (Major League Baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Young_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Young (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Eovaldi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Eovaldi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Glove_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold Glove Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby_Yates", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kirby Yates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Robertson_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Robertson (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Grossman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robbie Grossman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4134,h_2325,x_0,y_372/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_rangers/01j3h2wdvv5y03jmsm10.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755584", "eventUri": "eng-9755584", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-07-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Gray pitched 7.2 innings of one-run ball on Tuesday vs. Chicago, striking out five batters and allowing just four hits to lift the Rangers to their third straight win.\n\nAdvertisementRangers\n\nBe the smartest Rangers fan.

I've been searching for it for a while, so it does feel really good. I think it's something that's gonna continue to get better.\"\n\nGray began the month of June on the injured list with a groin strain suffered in his final appearance in May. He pitched out of the bullpen in his first outing afterward, and was effective. Then the trouble started.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his first start off the IL, Gray needed 65 pitches to get through three innings before being removed. The following start was the worst of his season, a three-inning, nine-run outing after which Gray voiced concerns about tipping his pitches.\n\nHe bounced back next time out with a six-inning shutout performance, but followed that up with another speed bump: a five-inning outing in which he allowed eight runs. When asked what went wrong in his blow-up against Baltimore, Gray simply said: \"Everything.\"\n\nSince the return of Max Scherzer and the resulting rotation reshuffling, Gray has been in a sort of in-between role with starting and relieving, his most recent outing being one-inning mop-up duty in a 9-1 loss against the Orioles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday night, however, in front of 39,000-plus at Globe Life Field, Gray shined in his first start post-All-Star break and lifted the Rangers over the American League's last-place team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What a job he did,\" manager Bruce Bochy said. \"It's been a while since he's been out there, too. He hasn't been that deep in the game. Just a terrific job. Good stuff, good command of the fastball and the slider. He gave us what we needed.\"\n\nThe night began with a 1-2-3 first inning followed by Gray working his way out of a jam in the second. He allowed a double and a single to start the inning before retiring the next three batters to keep Chicago scoreless.\n\nHe allowed his only run of the night in the third inning, an RBI single by Chicago's Andrew Vaughn. Then Gray turned the faucet off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe retired the next 15 batters he faced, closing out the third inning and stymying the Chicago lineup all the way into the eighth, when Jonathan Ornelas put a cap on Gray's night with an outstanding play on a ground ball to shortstop.\n\n\"That was unbelievable,\" Gray said. \"It really shocked me, I just thought that there was no chance at that one. Really fired me up.\"\n\nBochy removed Gray from the game at 80 pitches and with a 3-1 lead, the 32-year-old walking off the mound to a standing ovation from the sellout crowd at Globe Life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Sometimes a guy needs a reset, especially if he gets in a little bit of a rut,\" Bochy said. \"Maybe just needs a break, and that's what he got. He goes out there and does what he did tonight ... It worked out well for him, freshen that arm up a little bit.\"\n\nThe offense, still not firing on all cylinders, did enough. Texas got on the board early when the Rangers got to White Sox pitcher and premier trade deadline asset Garrett Crochet, perhaps the single-most rumored pitcher to be on the market prior to next week's deadline.\n\nTexas scored a pair of runs in the first inning thanks to an Adolis Garcia single that drove in Robbie Grossman, then a double-steal of second and home that sent Garcia to second base and Smith scurrying in to score the second run. Crochet, whose workload is likely being managed as the trade rumors swirl, pitched just four innings and 74 pitches before being removed.\n\nThe Rangers added an insurance run to their 2-1 lead via a Josh Smith double in the eighth, which proved to be critical when reliever Josh Sborz allowed a solo home run in the ninth to make it a one-run game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKirby Yates, however, as he's done so consistently this season for the Rangers, entered the game and recorded the final two outs to slam the door and seal the win for Gray.\n\nIt's the Rangers' third-straight one-run victory, one that perhaps saw the July of Jon fully kick into gear.\n\nTwitter: @coylio33\n\nPhotos: Texas Rangers top White Sox for second night in a row, pick up third straight win 10 imagesView

Mandatory Credit: Andrew Dieb-USA TODAY Sports / Andrew Dieb-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Texas Rangers scored twice in the first and added a big insurance run in the eighth to beat the Chicago White Sox 3-2 Tuesday at Globe Life Field.\n\nIt's the Rangers third consecutive win as they try to close the gap in the American League West. Their offense continues to struggle putting up big numbers, but their pitching has been up to the task.\n\nTexas scored twice in the first on Adolis Garcia's RBI single and on a double steal from Garcia and Josh Smith, who stole home on the play.\n\nRangers starter Jon Gray, however, was too much for the White Sox over 7 2/3 innings. Gray held Chicago to a run on four hits while striking out five. Gray's 7 2/3 innings is his longest outing since going eight innings against the Washington Nationals on April 30.\n\nFor the first time this season, closer Kirby Yates was used in three consecutive games. That was likely not the plan until Josh Sborz allowed a leadoff, ninth-inning home run to Andrew Benintendi to close the gap to 3-2. Yates retired the final two batters on six pitches with a strikeout and flyout.\n\nThe Rangers won a one-run game for the third consecutive night for the first time since July 21-23, 2017. The Rangers are 15-11 in one-run games in 2024. The Rangers have won 10 of their past 14 games.\n\nRight-hander Nathan Eovaldi (6-4, 3.36) faces right-hander Chris Flexen (2-9, 5.22) in Game 3 at 7:05 p.m. Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globe_Life_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Globe Life Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Gray", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jon Gray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolis_Garc\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adolis Garc\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby_Yates", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kirby Yates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Flexen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Flexen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Sborz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Sborz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Benintendi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Benintendi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Eovaldi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Eovaldi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3374,h_1897,x_0,y_372/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_rangers/01j3h8ra8a8z774xedzr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755584", "eventUri": "eng-9755584", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-07-21", "dateEnd": "2017-07-23", "textStart": 1386, "textEnd": 1402}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-30", "textStart": 985, "textEnd": 993}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

He hasn't played in a professional game since May 26 and has missed nearly half (46 of 100) of the Texas Rangers' schedule due to a stress reaction in his back. He spent the bulk of June and the first half of July at the club's facility in Arizona on a rehab trek and didn't return to the Globe Life Field clubhouse until Friday.\n\nA shot at year-end hardware is likely out of the question. A chance to return to the major leagues is all he wants now.\n\n\"This is what I love to do, this is what I get paid to do,\" Carter said. \"Any time that something throw you off track and you can't do that, that sucks. I'm not the first person to ever get hurt, but I know everybody else would say that it sucks. I want to be out there playing regardless, hopefully we're close to that.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarter took overhand batting practice on Sunday for the first time since he was placed on the injured list and is expected to take batting practice at Globe Life Field before Tuesday's game vs. the Chicago White Sox. It's a significant step for the 21-year-old, who had swung a bat and ran in Arizona before the organization backed off of his progression because \"it wasn't really where we wanted it to be.\"\n\nRangers\n\nBe the smartest Rangers fan.

Different approach this time, and I think it's going better, for sure, the second time.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former second-round pick experienced \"the exact same\" back injury three seasons ago in the minor leagues. It helped him identify the issue when it arose again in May, and instead of opting to fight through the issue, he recognized the need to pause and heal.\n\n\"Instead of being gung-ho, fighting through it as 18-year-old Low-A Evan, versus 21-year-old facing All-Star pitchers in the big leagues Evan, you can't really fight through it quite as long,\" said Carter, who slashed .132/.193/.189 with 19 strikeouts in May. \"You kind of get exposed very quickly whenever you're not up to par with how you should feel and how you should play.\n\n\"I wasn't doing myself or the team any good by trying to play through it, so we backed off and it definitely wasn't near as progressed of an injury.\"\n\nAdvertisementRelated StoriesView MoreWatch Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9 share gratitude, humor in Hall of

Moore received a signing bonus slightly above-slot at $3 million, two people familiar with the negotiations told The Dallas Morning News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoore, according to Rangers' brass, was a prospect with whom they had \"extensive history,\" even before the draft. And apparently they liked what they saw.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"As we went into the draft this year,\" Young said, \"we didn't know what was going to be available at the back of the draft, it was a little bit different than the last few years. But Malcolm was at the top of the list in terms of players we identified that fit what we're looking for with the Texas Rangers.

They took Moore at 30th overall in this year's draft, signing him and 15 other draft picks out of their 20 selections. That includes deals with second-rounder Dylan Dreiling, third-rounder Casey Cook and fourth-rounder David Hagaman. The deadline for rookie signings is Aug. 1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoore, a 20-year-old catcher who played two seasons at Stanford, was rated among the top prospects in this year's draft class by FanGraphs (No. 18), MLB Pipeline (No. 26), and Baseball America (No. 31). He posted a lifetime .288/.399./.560/.958 slash line with 31 home runs and 99 RBI across 118 games for the Cardinal in his collegiate career, earning Pac-12 All-Conference honorable mention honors in both years.\n\nThat's his merit with the bat and behind the plate. The Rangers, though, are just impressed with Moore off the field.\n\n\"That's a big part of what we do and what our scouts do,\" Fagg said. \"We evaluate talent but we gotta get the right people, too. That's a big call we gotta make. Sometimes we have a guy and go 'We don't think so, not a fit for us.' C-Y says it all the time: 'The Texas Rangers aren't for everybody.' And I believe that, too.\"\n\nAdvertisementAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, the Rangers announced the signing of four undrafted free agents: right-handed pitcher Grant Cherry from California State University Long Beach, right-handed pitcher J'Briell Easley from Kansas, infielder Theo Hardy from San Jose State, and right-handed pitcher Josh Sanders from Texas Tech. The terms of the deals were not disclosed by the team.\n\nMoore spent the afternoon at Globe Life Field, touring the Rangers' clubhouse and taking batting practice with Ranger big leaguers Evan Carter, Robbie Grossman and Wyatt Langford. The Sacramento, Calif. native, unsurprisingly, was impressed with the state-of-the-art Rangers facilities. His next stop will be the Rangers' rookie complex in Arizona, where Moore says he's excited to \"get to work.\"\n\n\"Growing up this was always the dream, to play professional baseball,\" Moore said. \"Being here the past couple days, couldn't be in a better city and a better place, I'm really excited for what's next.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStaff writer Evan Grant contributed to this

Chris Young wants team to make decision for him", "body": "Young said the Rangers will have to be disciplined rather than aggressive if the team doesn't turn things around by the trade deadline.\n\nTexas Rangers general manager Chris Young appeared on the GBag Nation show on 105.3 The Fan (KRLD-FM) to discuss the returns of Josh Jung, Evan Carter and the team's trade deadline plans.\n\nHere are some of the highlights, edited lightly for clarity:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow close are Josh Jung and Evan Carter to getting back?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Young: I was just outside watching Josh [Jung], he hit batting practice today. The next step for him will be a live batting practice off a pitcher. Then at which point, we hope we can get him out on rehab for a few games. My hope is that roughly 10 days, if everything goes smoothly, that he could be back. Evan [Carter] is also making great progress, feeling really, really good. He'll take his first batting practice session tomorrow, at which point I think we can start to accelerate his progression as well. My hope is that shortly after August 1, Evan will be back. So we're trending the right direction with both those guys. We need them desperately. They're big parts of our lineup, obviously two pieces that we were depending on this year. When we get them back, my hope is that it just makes our lineup a little bit more complete, and our run production will improve.\n\nRangers\n\nBe the smartest Rangers fan. Get the latest news.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nIs it frustrating is it that people are talking about the Rangers as being sellers?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYoung: Well, it's a great question because I'm competitive by nature. I came into the season with very high expectations, very high conviction level in this roster. I really believed that we were going to be the team to beat in the West. Certainly it hasn't gone according to plan in terms of we've had some injuries, we've had some underperformance and we haven't been able to string together good stretches of baseball consistently, the way we did last year and the way good teams do.\n\nSo when people ask those questions and I even have to think about us potentially being sellers, that's not fun for me, that's something that I'm very frankly, not proud of. The competitive aspect of my character comes out and I don't like it. But the reality is, it's my job to not only evaluate the present, but to evaluate the future, and make decisions based upon what's best for this franchise this year, and 2025 and beyond. That's part of the decision that I'll have to make here at some point. We've got a great group in the front office, we've spent a ton of time preparing for a bunch of different routes that we could take here at the deadline. I think this is a very important series for us in determining where we stand and what we can become as a team. My hope is that we really get hot here, that we play great baseball against the White Sox, and that carries into the road trip. Because the deadline is next Tuesday, and we're gonna have to make some tough calls in this next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs this the time of year you receive more calls about your team?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYoung: Teams have been very respectful, which I appreciate. Those are sensitive calls. Obviously, I was on the other end of those calls last year when we were a very clear buyer so you want to be respectful, not understanding what the mentality of the opposing general manager may be. That said, the one takeaway I've had from almost every call I've had with winning teams is they look at us and say, one, \"You've got a lot of really good players,\" two, \"We can see you making a run here.\"\n\nOther teams see what I see, in terms of the talent on this roster. They obviously envy some of our players, that's the reason they're calling is that they want to upgrade and improve their own teams. They're checking to see which players we may make available if we went that route. But in those conversations, they make it very clear that they see our division, they see our place in the standings. They know we haven't been fully healthy, and they understand what we have coming back. They also understand if we decide to go for it, why we would make that decision. So I'm not sure it gives me any more clarity as to where we stand and how to proceed.\n\nBut I think in terms of the reputation of being aggressive, I appreciate that. I think there's times to be aggressive. I think there's times to be disciplined. I think that we try to balance both of those. But in the end, I know how important this team is to our fans. I know how important last year was to our fans, what it meant to our fans, and I have said this since the day I got the job, our fans deserve winning teams. It's our jobs to give them that. So being aggressive means that we can give our fans the best chance to watch a winning team. I'm all for it. That said, I also want to be disciplined and recognizing that we do have an uphill battle and there may be a time to be disciplined, at which point I'll have to make that call and decide what the best path forward is for the franchise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat's the process like internally to get to a decision? Could you guys take it unknown into deadline day and see how good the offers are?\n\nYoung: We talked about that today as a group and I think it's really hard to come down to the last 24 hours and not have a committed path, mainly because we have so many players that are coveted in terms of the trade market. With that in mind, it's just we don't have the bandwidth or the manpower to really spread ourselves that thin if it comes down to the last 24 hours. So what I'd like to see really is us come out here and play really good baseball get hot, win four or five in a row and make the decision for us, make it very clear that this is a team that can compete into August and September. If we do that, and I say this wholeheartedly, I believe we can. But I've been saying this for weeks to you guys and every time we take a step forward we seem to take a step backwards. So I really want to see us start turning this on and progress to the level that I think we can, in which scenario I'll gladly bet on this group of guys to go out and find a way to play really good baseball over the next two months and make a playoff push.\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreTexas Rangers' Jacob deGrom is 'pretty close' to facing hittersAs he nears return to field, Texas Rangers' Evan Carter reflects on rocky rookie yearAdvertisement\n\nFind more Rangers coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.\n\nClick or tap here to sign up for our Rangers newsletter.", "source": {"uri": "dallasnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Dallas Morning News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Jung", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Jung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Young_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Young (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRLD-FM", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "KRLD-FM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_deGrom", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacob deGrom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Dallas Morning News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/LDLDXLLD4VBIBOTNT7AJOG2TZA.jpg?auth=ff54f9f168fdf7d2b4ed7f60c5cc7738ee06183a5a5ed464d2e1d324c2556164&height=467&width=830&focal=2333,820&quality=40", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755584", "eventUri": "eng-9755584", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 1024, "textEnd": 1032}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Chicago is 0-4 since the break.\n\nTexas enters the contest four games below .500, an unexpected spot at this point of the year for the reigning World Series champions.

He made a relief appearance and pitched a scoreless inning in the Rangers' 9-1 loss to the Baltimore Orioles on Friday. Before that, he got a win against the Los Angeles Angels in a July 8 start, where he gave up three runs on five hits while striking out two and allowing one walk in five innings.\n\nIn his lone career outing against the White Sox, Gray gave up one run and three hits while striking out 10 batters in a no-decision on June 12, 2022.\n\nCrochet (6-6, 3.02 ERA) also will be facing his opponent for the first time in several years. He last pitched against the Rangers in 2021, his first full major league season. He was a reliever back then, and he tossed a combined 3 2/3 scoreless innings across two appearances against Texas.\n\nThe left-hander, who has been a bright spot for the struggling White Sox, will be making his first start since his first All-Star Game appearance. He threw a scoreless inning for the AL All-Stars last week.\n\nCrochet enters Tuesday with an American League-best 150 strikeouts, the second most in the majors behind the 159 compiled by the San

Mandatory Credit: Andrew Dieb-USA TODAY Sports / Andrew Dieb-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIt feels as if the Texas Rangers have been waiting on starting pitching all season long. Well, maybe it's arrived.\n\nOr at least on the verge.\n\nIf the defending World Series champs are going to make a move and defend their title, and prove to general manager Chris Young not to sell at the trade deadline, what happens on the bump will play a leading role.\n\nThe Rangers have gotten three solid starts in a row, the latest from Jon Gray in a 3-2 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Tuesday night. Not so coincidentally, it's led to a three-game winning streak that has Texas (49-52) just three games back of both the Houston Astros and Seattle Mariners in the American League West.\n\nMaking his first start since July 8, Gray tossed 7 2/3 masterful innings and permitted just one earned run on four hits and no walks. He struck out five, threw 80 pitches (63 strikes) and recorded career strikeout No. 1,200 when he fanned Paul DeJong in the second inning.\n\nThe 78.8% strike percentage was the Gray's highest this season and second-best of his career to only an 86.7% (45 pitches/39 strikes) in 2022 against the Miami Marlins.\n\nGray worked out of some trouble early, including a second-and-third, no-outs jam in the second, before hitting his stride. The lone run allowed came on Andrew Vaughn's RBI single in the third before. Gray didn't permit a baserunner after, retiring the final 15 batters faced before giving way to Josh Sborz and the bullpen with two outs in the eighth.\n\n\"It felt really good,\" Gray said, according to MLB.com. \"It's been a long time since I felt that. I have been searching for that for a while, so it does feel really good. I think it's something that's going to continue to get better. I really do.

Gray pitched 7 2/3 innings of one-run ball on Tuesday vs. Chicago, striking out five batters and allowing just four hits to lift the Rangers to their third straight win.\n\n\"I feel like things got better as we went,\" Gray said after the game. \"It's been a long time since I've felt that. I've been searching for it for a while, so it does feel really good. I think it's something that's gonna continue to get better.\"\n\nGray began the month of June on the injured list with a groin strain suffered in his final appearance in May. He pitched out of the bullpen in his first outing afterward, and was effective. Then the trouble started.\n\nIn his first start off the IL, Gray needed 65 pitches to get through three innings before being removed. The following start was the worst of his season, a three-inning, nine-run outing after which Gray voiced concerns about tipping his pitches.\n\nHe bounced back next time out with a six-inning shutout performance, but followed that up with another speedbump: a three-inning outing in which he allowed nine runs. When asked what went wrong in his blow-up against Baltimore, Gray simply said: \"Everything.\"\n\nSince the return of Max Scherzer and the resulting rotation reshuffling, Gray has been in a sort of in-between role with starting and relieving, his most recent outing being one-inning mop-up duty in a 9-1 loss against the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nOn Tuesday night, however, in front of 39,000-plus at Globe Life Field, Gray shined in his first start post-All-Star break and lifted the Rangers over the American League's last-place team.\n\n\"What a job he did,\" manager Bruce Bochy said. \"It's been a while since he's been out there, too. He hasn't been that deep in the game. Just a terrific job. Good stuff, good command of the fastball and the slider. He gave us what we needed.\n\nThe night began with a 1-2-3 first inning followed by Gray working his way out of a jam in the second. He allowed a double and a single to start the inning before retiring the next three batters to keep Chicago scoreless.\n\nHe allowed his only run of the night in the third inning, an RBI single by Chicago's Andrew Vaughn. Then Gray turned the faucet off.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nHe retired the next 15 batters he faced, closing out the third inning and stymying the Chicago lineup all the way into the eighth, when Jonathan Ornelas put a cap on Gray's night with an outstanding play on a ground ball to shortstop.\n\n\"That was unbelievable,\" Gray said. \"It really shocked me, I just thought that there was no chance at that one. Really fired me up.\"\n\nBochy removed Gray from the game at 80 pitches and with a 3-1 lead, the 32-year-old walking off the mound to a standing ovation from the sellout crowd at Globe Life.\n\n\"Sometimes a guy needs a reset, especially if he gets in a little bit of a rut,\" Bochy said. \"Maybe just needs a break, and that's what he got. He goes out there and does what he did tonight ... It worked out well for him, freshen that arm up a little bit.\"\n\nThe offense, still not firing on all cylinders, did enough. Texas got on the board early when the Rangers got to White Sox pitcher and premier trade deadline asset Garrett Crochet, perhaps the single-most rumored pitcher to be on the market prior to next week's deadline.\n\nTexas scored a pair of runs in the first inning thanks to an Adolis Garcia single that drove in Robbie Grossman, then a double-steal of second and home that sent Garcia to second base and Smith scurrying in to score the second run. Crochet, whose workload is likely being managed as the trade rumors swirl, pitched just four innings and 74 pitches before being removed.\n\nThe Rangers added an insurance run to their 2-1 lead via a Josh Smith double in the eighth, which proved to be critical when reliever Josh Sborz allowed a solo home run in the ninth to make it a one-run game.\n\nKirby Yates, however, as he's done so consistently this season for the Rangers, entered the game and recorded the final two outs to slam the door and seal the win for Gray.\n\nIt's the Rangers' third-straight one-run victory, one that perhaps saw the July of Jon fully kick into gear.\n\n\u00a92024 The Dallas Morning News.

That's still possible, with rentals potentially heading out of town. But we have a bit more on this. It's rather interesting stuff.\n\n\"The team would like to add another bat, and perhaps a controllable reliever,\" Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic reports.\n\nThe report also indicates that Texas could potentially look to trade impending free agent Michael Lorenzen. To a lesser degree, fellow starter Jon Gray might be available ahead of the deadline.\n\nRelated: Updated Texas Rangers news and rumors\n\nThe clearest takeaway here is that Texas could both buy and sell over the next few days. As Rosenthal noted in his report, starting pitching is seen as a strength internally. If the Rangers can add another bat or a reliever by moving off a starter, it might make sense.\n\nThis change of approach has been made possible by the Seattle Mariners struggling a ton recently. Seattle has lost seven of its past eight games.

However, the team got positive injury news before its clash with the Chicago White Sox on Monday, giving it a glimmer of hope.\n\nTyler Mahle, Cody Bradford, and Evan Carter are all progressing in their respective rehabs, via MLB.com's Kennedi Landry.\n\n\"Rangers injury updates from the clubhouse:\n\n- Tyler Mahle feels good, will pitch at Frisco later this week to continue his ramp up\n\n- Cody Bradford will come out of the bullpen tomorrow in Frisco\n\n- Evan Carter did some shagging in the outfield today, will take BP tomorrow,\" Landry reported.\n\nTexas could use the help on both sides of the ball. The team currently ranks 17th in the league with a 4.05 ERA, as well as 19th with a .238 batting average.\n\nMahle, a veteran right-hander who spent the last two seasons with the Minnesota Twins, has a career 4.30 ERA and 1.304 WHIP across 635.2 innings. The 6-foot-3, 210-pounder also has a stellar average of 9.6 strikeouts per nine innings, as well as a 2.93 strikeout-to-walk ratio. He will be a valuable arm to add to the middle or back of the rotation upon returning from his elbow ailment.\n\nBradford has a less extensive big-league track record but has looked promising in limited action. The southpaw had a 3-0 record with a 1.40 ERA, 0.621 WHIP, and an 8.50 strikeout-to-walk ratio across 19.1 innings pitched this year before going down with a fractured rib. He could be available in early August barring any setbacks, via Sports Illustrated.\n\nWhile the pitchers have each had plenty of good moments in The Show, Carter's had a different path thus far.\n\nThe Rangers need Evan Carter to continue developing this season\n\nCarter has struggled this year, slashing .188/.272/.361 with five homers and 15 RBI across 45 games played. The preseason AL Rookie of the Year, who's been out since May 26th with a stress fracture in his back, swung a bat at the team's training facility in Surprise, Arizona, before the All-Star break. However, the 21-year-old said he's much further along now and is inching closer to a minor-league rehab stint.\n\nCarter sounded off on how far he's come recently, via The Dallas Morning News' Shawn McFarland.\n\n\"I think it might've been the first day of overhand [batting practice],\" Carter said of the Arizona sessions. \"I mean, my swing volume that I've taken [in Arlington], I didn't even get close to that. Different approach this time, and I think it's going better, for sure, the second time.\"\n\nTexas, who is also awaiting fellow youngster Josh Jung's return, needs Carter to show why he was worth the 50th overall pick in the 2020 draft. At the very least, a late-season push from the Tennessee native would be a positive sign for the team's future.\n\nRegardless, the Rangers are still just five games behind the Houston Astros and Seattle Mariners for first place in the AL West. If the team can stay afloat as it heals up, it could be in the mix for the division crown in September.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors":

That means taking care of business against the White Sox, MLB's worst team, and the last-placed Toronto Blue Jays this weekend. The Rangers are four games behind the Houston Astros and Seattle Mariners, who are tied atop the American League West.\n\n\"This is a very important series for us in determining where we stand and what we can become as a team,\" he said. \"My hope is we really get hot and play really good baseball against the White Sox, and that carries into the road trip because the deadline is next Tuesday, and we're going to have to make some tough calls in this next week.\"\n\nYoung didn't see the struggles coming. Although it's hard to plan for the rash of injuries the club has been dealt, important players in the lineup have struggled to produce as they did a year ago and the offense, as a whole, has been unable to consistently produce.\n\n\"I'm competitive by nature. I came into this season with very high expectations, [with] a high conviction level in this roster, and really believed that we were going to be the team to beat in the West,\" Young said. \"[The season] certainly hasn't gone according to plan in terms of some injuries, and we've had some underperformance, and we haven't been able to string together good stretches of baseball consistently the way we did last year and the way good teams do.\"\n\nEven the teams calling recently to kick the tires on trade possibilities with Young have intimated to him that a Rangers run wouldn't surprise them.\n\n\"So other teams see what I see in terms of the talent on this roster, and they obviously envy some of our players; that's the reason they're calling,\" he said. \"We have so many players who are coveted in terms of the trade market.\"\n\n\"What I'd like to see, really, is us get hot, win four or five in a row, and make the decision for us, make it very clear that this is a team that can compete into August and September,\" Young said. \"I say this wholeheartedly: I believe we can, but I've been saying this for weeks to you guys, and every time we take a step forward, we seem to take a step backward, so I really want to see us start turning it on and progress to the level that I think we can. In that scenario, I'll gladly bet on this group of guys to go out and find a way to play really good baseball over the next two months and make a playoff push.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRLD_(AM)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KRLD (AM)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship_(broadcasting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flagship (broadcasting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRLD-FM", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KRLD-FM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walk-off home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2142,h_1204,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/inside_the_rangers/01j3g0qxk1e646dqsx6y.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755584", "eventUri": "eng-9755584", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 124, "textEnd": 131}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

He's one of the best pitchers in the game. You saw what he did last year for us, especially in those huge games, including the last game of the World Series. He brings so much confidence to the ballclub, I know guys love playing behind him. They see how intense he is and he's all about winning. You won't find a better teammate, too. He's there for everybody. Even in spring training, he's trying to help young pitchers, he's watching them. He's just such a tremendous human being, along with the great talent. So when he takes the mound, yeah there's an added appeal to winning the game.\n\nJon Gray looked like he had that confidence and swagger in his Tuesday start. When do you know that guy's got that confidence today?\n\nBochy: When you haven't had some success, it's going to wane a little bit. It's just going to happen to any player, I don't care if it's a hitter or a pitcher. Jon [Gray] was struggling a little bit with his command and giving up the long ball. Sometimes its just good to find a way to reset. That's whether you take a break from a start or go to the bullpen, which he did. It just gives you a chance to reflect or work on some things. It was good to see him have that kind of command with both the slider and the fastball last night.\n\nRangers\n\nBe the smartest Rangers fan. Get the latest news.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nGetting these kind of wins late in the game, does that help you guys start ascending into what you've been before?\n\nBochy: When you win a lot of tight ballgames, it's great experience for the guys. They've been through it, not that they need it. Still, when the offense isn't quite clicking, you need your pitching to come through and you need to play good, fundamental baseball. That's executing, whether it's making your pitches on the mound, getting a bunt down, guys couldn't have worked a better double steal last night. [Adolis Garc\u00cda] did a great job stopping there, and of course [Josh Smith], what a great jump he had. Those are the little things you have to do to win these tight games and find ways to score when you're not slugging like your normally do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt does a lot for the club, I will say that, when you can win games late. It just breeds confidence late in the game, you just feel like you're going to win that game. When you lose a lot of those games, you feel like you're going to lose those games. It's good that they've gotten on a roll here with some good, low-scoring games and coming away with wins.\n\nCan you walk us through what the process might look like for Josh Jung and what his next steps may be? Do you ever have to talk to him about not putting too much pressure on yourself mentally?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBochy: Today, he's going to face some live pitching again at 3 o'clock. He'll get out there and probably get 20-30 swings in there today. If he comes out of that well, he will not go to Toronto with us. We'll wait a day, see how he recovers. Once you do that a couple times, now you're looking at a rehab. If we think he needs one more time facing live pitching, then we'll do that. I could see him hitting the rehab games here real soon. I'm talking about in a few days. Once you do that, we have to monitor how it goes down there as far as how the hand feels, but also how he's seeing the ball. We have to remember, this guy has missed a lot of baseball, including spring training. We don't want to bring him up too early, because he's got to get on time with the fastball and all the pitches. He even said yesterday, the first 10 pitches, \"Yeah, I just wasn't on time there.\" But you could see it get better. That's only gonna get better with game pitching now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat's the biggest message we can get across to him, to make sure you're ready, make sure you feel good and don't feel like you have to carry the day. Sure, we'd love to have him back, we need him, but at the same time you got to do what's fair to him. Like I said, he's missed so many games, it's going to be important that we give him some time so when he comes up here he's ready. It's hard to hit major league pitching, and when you haven't seen it for pretty much a whole year, now it's going to take some at bats down there. How many, I can't tell you. I just want to let him know, \"Hey, don't rush this thing, just make sure we're ready.\"\n\nWith the trade deadline approaching, does that make managing the locker room any tougher knowing that it's probably on some guys' minds about, \"Hey, am I still going to be here next week?\"?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBochy: These guys haven't mentioned it. Sure, they're aware of it, but they're not talking about it. I haven't had to talk to anybody and there really hasn't been any rumors as far as names in particular. But I do realize it's a part of the game. As a player, you have to deal with it. But the best way to deal with it is not think about it because really, what can you do? You have no control over it, so the only thing you can control is go out there and do your thing. These guys have kept that focus. Obviously we want to make it tough on everybody by going out there and playing good baseball and staying in this thing, because we believe we can win this. That's not going to ever leave us, it won't every leave me and we're going to keep fighting.\n\nI was asked yesterday if we're watching the standings, but it doesn't matter if we don't win.\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreTexas Rangers officially introduce first-round pick Malcolm Moore, sign other draft picksTexas Rangers' Josh Jung to begin rehab assignment with Frisco; Evan Carter not far behindJonathan Ornelas answers Texas Rangers' call with spectacular jump throw\n\nFind more Rangers coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClick or tap here to sign up for our Rangers newsletter.", "source": {"uri": "dallasnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Dallas Morning News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Jung", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Jung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Eovaldi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Eovaldi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRLD-FM", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "KRLD-FM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Bochy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Bochy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Gray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Gray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunt_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bunt (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Dallas Morning News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisco,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frisco, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frisco, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/ZWJ7WCWG4NCGVD4JOIYKA47QLQ.jpg?auth=7cf40ca89202e6451b357fa0dd8abad798a5b7e7458d0a2dee2c0b2ead847899&height=467&width=830&focal=2645,1195&quality=40", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755584", "eventUri": "eng-9755584", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Rosenthal notes that Texas is looking for another bat as well as possibly a controllable reliever on the trade market.\n\nFellow Rangers right-hander Jon Gray is also said to be a trade candidate, but Rosenthal adds that it is less likely that Texas will move either Nathan Eovaldi or Andrew Heaney.\n\nLorenzen, an All-Star for the Detroit Tigers in 2023, signed a one-year, $4.5 million deal with the Rangers over the winter. While his strikeout numbers continue to trend down, Lorenzen is still having a satisfactory 2024 season, going 5-5 with a 3.53 ERA in 17 total starts for Texas.\n\nThe defending champion Rangers are unlikely to sell in bulk at the deadline, even at 49-52 on the season. That is because of a recent fade by the division-leading Seattle Mariners that now has Texas sitting just three games back of the AL West crown.\n\nStill, the Rangers have a cavalry coming soon with starting pitchers Jacob deGrom, Tyler Mahle, Dane Dunning, and Cody Bradford all expected back from injury at some point before the end of the regular season. That means that a consolidation trade may be necessary with Lorenzen (who has drawn interest from contending teams in months past) and to a lesser extent Gray (who is still signed through 2025) seemingly the likeliest ones to go.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darryn_albert@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Darryn Albert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Rosenthal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ken Rosenthal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lorenzen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Lorenzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Heaney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Heaney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Gray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Gray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Eovaldi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Eovaldi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dane_Dunning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dane Dunning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_deGrom", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacob deGrom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Mahle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Mahle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Tukong_Moosul", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Tukong Moosul", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/texas-rangers-logo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755584", "eventUri": "eng-9755584", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

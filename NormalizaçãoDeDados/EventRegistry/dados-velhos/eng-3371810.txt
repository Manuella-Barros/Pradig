Huge screams sound off about 53 seconds into the clip as Sheeran steps up to the mic with his guitar and his signature smile. Can anyone blame them?\n\nBy now, everyone knows Sheeran has ruled the 2017 music scene with the massive success of his third studio album Divide and his own largely sold-out Divide World Tour. The Grammy-winning ginger-haired singer is a master of covers. He and his UK pal James Blunt delivered a brilliant rendition of Elton John's \"Sacrifice,\" for example. His team up with Mendes on the slowed-down, romantic version of \"Mercy\" proves to be no exception.\n\nYou can barely hear the \"Thinking Out Loud\" singer's voice over the thunderous screams. But the fans, and Mendes, don't even care. It's a moment to be relished in the music world and a \"pop-up\" for Mendes that may not easily be rivaled. Mendes spoke of Sheeran's influence on him as a songwriter in a candid Rolling Stone interview last year.\n\n\"Ed Sheeran wrote his songs, so I wanted to write my own songs,\" he explained. \"He's just like an average guy and a very approachable person. I've actually gotten the chance to meet him, and he's just like a very sweet guy. He is just so normal, and that's the best part about him.\"\n\nIt's amazing how at a sharp glance, Shawn Mendes and Ed Sheeran look like two close buds who might sit around a neighborhood campfire and serenade the ladies in a romantic, but casual kind of way. Though they both look like your brother's best friend in the best sort of hunky \"average Joe\" kind of way, these guys are anything but \"average.\" They share a common bond of songwriting, guitars, and international superstardom. Putting them together on the same stage in a surprise duet is the kind of epic live show moment fans on both sides likely will never forget.\n\nCheck out the entire captured \"Mercy\" duet moment in the video above and stay tuned to AXS for Ed Sheeran and Shawn Mendes updates.", "id": "9814445", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Watch: Shawn Mendes brings out Ed Sheeran for duet", "image": "https://i.axs.com/2017/08/40661-image-optimized_59963d03a47ac.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 114, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 121}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "216991", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "241442", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Album"}, "id": "302629", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album"}, {"label": {"eng": "Song"}, "id": "302635", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song"}, {"label": {"eng": "Music"}, "id": "302636", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}, "id": "302655", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cover version"}, "id": "302797", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pop music"}, "id": "303105", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music"}, {"label": {"eng": "Grammy Award"}, "id": "304627", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ginger"}, "id": "307885", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger"}, {"label": {"eng": "Elton John"}, "id": "313070", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_John"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ed Sheeran"}, "id": "317753", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sheeran"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "id": "331120", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center"}, {"label": {"eng": "Duet"}, "id": "333493", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duet"}, {"label": {"eng": "James Blunt"}, "id": "469193", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Blunt"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shawn Mendes"}, "id": "1270070", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Mendes"}, {"label": {"eng": "Thinking Out Loud"}, "id": "1287347", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_Out_Loud"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 58, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 59, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Personal Pages", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Personal_Pages"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}], "time": "03:16:00"}

To a packed arena full of thousands of adoring fans, Mendes performed like a true teen dream playing a set made up of recent hits from his latest record Illuminate and debut album Handwritten favorites, lighting up New York Illuminate tour stop with a number of vulnerable moments, and even a surprise appearance from Ed Sheeran.\n\nTo start off the evening, opening act Charlie Puth performed a total of six songs to warm up the evening, playing passionately from behind his signature keyboard. Before showing off his smooth, pitch perfect voice, he opened up to the crowd while introducing several songs, explaining some tracks as extremely personal releases. Of \"Attention\" he took a Taylor Swift-like route and declared, \"Someone broke my heart, so I wrote about it... I gave my heart when I wrote this.\" During his rendition of the breakup track, Puth looked proud to see the crowd sing the words back to him as lights flashed synchronized to the final triumphant harmonies of the song.\n\nTo conclude his opening set, Puth ended on his mega-hit \"See You Again.\" While he had been giving each song a little intro throughout his 30-minute set, Puth got rather vulnerable for his finale song. He explained that he wrote in honor of his friend who passed away in 2012, who ironically had predicted that Puth would one day have a song in a movie. \"I never talk about this in depth on stage, but it just felt right today. If you've ever lost somebody and are wondering if they know you're thinking about them, this song is so they know.\"\n\nWhen it was time for Shawn Mendes to take the stage, audio played of press proclaiming the nineteen-year-old singer's rapid rise to success -- a phenomenon the singer proved was possible as he confidently emerged from the floor of the stage. To kick off the set, the singer proved he was going to give his all and began with Pop Charts No. 1 hit \"There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back,\" asking fans to scream out the lyrics from the get-go.\n\nAfter playing his sweet mid-tempo (and adorably innocent) Illuminate track \"Lights On,\" Mendes crooned the crowd with a medley seamlessly flowing between Illuminate tracks \"I Don't Even Know Your Name,\" \"Kid in Love,\" flowing delicately into a Jackson 5 cover of \"I Want You Back.\"\n\nSeveral songs in, Mendes recognized the significance of his New York crowd. \"I just want to say that there are these very certain cities in the world that make me go crazy before I get on stage, and this is one of them. I always have to mention it that the people who found me in the very beginning of my career are here tonight, the first fans who stopped me on the street to take photos. You guys had no idea this was happening, and now it's happening. It's incredible, so enjoy the show.\"\n\nLater, Mendes was alone on stage and exhibited the same sincerity as his simplistic beginnings singing \"The Weight\" and \"A Little Too Much\" under a sole spotlight. Before performing the latter he told the crowd how special it is to him. \"It's one of the first songs I wrote. As a songwriter and as a musician -- as a creative person in general -- this song is everything I wish I could have written,\" going on to sing the song outpouring with emotion.\n\nTo continue with the set's most wholehearted moments, the singer moved the show to a smaller B-stage where a grand piano emerged, performing three of his most intimate releases \"Life of the Party,\" \"Three Empty Words,\" and \"Roses\" under a glowing ball reminiscent of his Illuminate tour title. Prior to singing his own ballads, Mendes covered a verse and chorus of Ed Sheeran's \"Castle on the Hill\" -- little did fans in the Brooklyn arena know that the snippet was actually foreshadowing for the surprise that was coming.\n\nUpon returning to the main stage, Mendes offered the most major pop-star moment of his set by surprising the crowd with Sheeran himself. Greeted by roaring screams, Sheeran joined Mendes on the second verse of \"Mercy\" and harmonized his way to the end before casually leaving the stage. \"That was just as crazy for me as it was for you guys,\" Mendes gushed.\n\nAfter finishing off the set on a dynamic \"Never Be Alone,\" Mendes came back for one final emotional moment, finishing off with \"Treat You Better.\" Beginning the finale from behind the piano with a long, evocative interlude, Mendes transitioned into the fast-paced album version of his smash hit to close out the show with a bang. His excitement to be reunited with the fans who took his career from Vine star to superstar was evident throughout the entire 90-minute set, but his seamless transitions from acoustic and electric guitars to piano -- along with his impressively consistent vocals and high energy -- made it clear that Mendes was destined to be far more than an Internet phenomenon.", "id": "9725445", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Shawn Mendes Lit Up Brooklyn With Intimate Moments & an Ed Sheeran Appearance: Recap", "image": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/shawn-mendes-barclays-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "216991", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "218051", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Album"}, "id": "302629", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album"}, {"label": {"eng": "Song"}, "id": "302635", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hot Singles Sales"}, "id": "302658", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100"}, {"label": {"eng": "Singing"}, "id": "302767", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cover version"}, "id": "302797", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pop music"}, "id": "303105", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music"}, {"label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}, "id": "303995", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Piano"}, "id": "306696", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano"}, {"label": {"eng": "Arena"}, "id": "310214", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena"}, {"label": {"eng": "Singer-songwriter"}, "id": "312540", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singer-songwriter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}, "id": "312913", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ed Sheeran"}, "id": "317753", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sheeran"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phenomenon"}, "id": "322361", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vine (service)"}, "id": "329177", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vine_(service)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "id": "331120", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center"}, {"label": {"eng": "B-stage"}, "id": "436402", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-stage"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shawn Mendes"}, "id": "1270070", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Mendes"}, {"label": {"eng": "Charlie Puth"}, "id": "1275659", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eleveneleven"}, {"label": {"eng": "See You Again (Wiz Khalifa song)"}, "id": "1298526", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/See_You_Again_(Wiz_Khalifa_song)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 424, "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Arts and Entertainment", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Arts_and_Entertainment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 599, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Vocal", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Vocal"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1029, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics"}], "time": "15:48:00"}

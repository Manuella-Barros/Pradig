{"id": 243212642, "title": "Nine Assassin\u2019s Creed in development is madness and far too much", "text": "Assassin\u2019s Creed \u2013 increasing production (Ubisoft) A reader is unimpressed by the idea of so many new Assassin\u2019s Creed games but fears that yearly sequels are going to become commonplace again. It always seems fashionable to be down on Assassin\u2019s Creed. I\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s my favourite ever series, or cutting edge gaming, but I\u2019ve enjoyed most of the ones I\u2019ve played and always consider a new one when it comes out. My main consideration is the reviews and whether I\u2019ve played one recently, because they\u2019re long games and you don\u2019t want to be playing the same basic thing twice in a row. I already heard the rumour that there\u2019s nine new games in development but didn\u2019t pay much attention to it because it is, after all, just a rumour. Then on Thursday there was this blog from the boss of Ubisoft that said there was more than one remake underway. So, okay, that\u2019s Shadows, Hexe, two remakes, and I think some mobile games, already confirmed so\u2026 maybe that nine games rumour was more believable than I thought. Maybe it was even an underestimate. I almost feel like it doesn\u2019t need saying but nine games in a franchise in which all the games are basically the same, except for the setting \u2013 and the split between those that are old school and modern role-players \u2013 is ridiculous overkill. The blog says: \u2018The goal is to have Assassin\u2019s Creed games come out more regularly, but not for it to be the same experience every year.\u2019 So they do want something every year but they don\u2019t want it to be the same thing. A nice thought (kind of) but somehow I don\u2019t imagine the differences between each one are going to be that big. It\u2019s not like one is going to be a flight sim and the other a dating game. It\u2019s obvious this is all part of the same madness that has overtaken every (non-Japanese) publisher since the beginning of the year, with the layoffs, the sudden pivot to live service games, and going multiformat. With Ubisoft though they\u2019ve kind of done all that already. They\u2019ve been trying for years to get a hit live service game but all they\u2019ve ever had is Rainbow Six Siege. So I think they realise now that that\u2019s not the answer (I\u2019m sure Sony will cotton on in a few years) and so they\u2019re going with the only other option they have: double down on what they know works. But surely they also realise that if you double, or triple, your output then people are going to get tired of it twice (or three times) as quickly. If a new Assassin\u2019s Creed came out every three years I\u2019d probably get them all. If it came out every year I\u2019d probably get so sick of hearing about it I wouldn\u2019t get any of them, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s me being weird. Having too much of a good thing is a very common problem. We don\u2019t need a return to yearly sequels and yet I get the feeling that Ubisoft aren\u2019t the only ones that are going to be thinking along these lines. Variety is the spice of life and if every year is just the same six big budget games time and time again things are going to get very stale very quickly.

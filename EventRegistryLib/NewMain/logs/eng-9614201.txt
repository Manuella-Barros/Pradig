No injuries have been reported.\n\nTesla is recalling more than 125,000 vehicles to fix a seat belt warning system that may increase the risk of an injury in a collision.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that the recall includes certain 2012-2024 Model S, 2015-2024 Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3, and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles.\n\nThe seat belt warning system is supposed to provide audible and visual seat belt reminder signals to drivers to alert them that their seat belt isn't fastened. The NHTSA said that on certain vehicles, the audible and visual seat belt reminder signals were not going off at the time they were supposed to, which doesn't comply with federal safety requirements.\n\nThe NHTSA said that as of Tuesday, Tesla had identified 104 warranty claims that may be related to the condition. The company isn't aware of any collisions, fatalities or injuries that may be related to the condition.\n\nTesla, which is headed by billionaire Elon Musk, plans to start deploying an over-the-air software update to the affected vehicles free of charge in June. The software update will remove dependency on the driver seat occupancy switch from the software and only rely on driver seat belt buckle and ignition status to activate the seat belt reminder signals.\n\nLast month Tesla recalled 3,878 of its 2024 Cybertrucks after it discovered that the accelerator pedal can become stuck, potentially causing the vehicle to accelerate unintentionally and increase the risk of a crash.\n\nIn February the NHTSA announced the recall of nearly 2.2 million Tesla vehicles sold in the United States because some warning lights on the instrument panel are too small. The agency also said at the time that it had upgraded a 2023 investigation into Tesla steering problems to an engineering analysis, a step closer to a recall.\n\nIn April the NHTSA said that it was investigating whether last year's recall of Tesla's Autopilot driving system did enough to make sure drivers pay attention to the road.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_belt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seat belt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Highway Traffic Safety Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_X", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model X"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_Y", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model Y"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warranty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warranty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignition_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ignition system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Throttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dashboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autopilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Specialized_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Specialized Vehicles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device_Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device Drivers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Safety_Products_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Safety Products and Services", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/31_05_2024_13_27_36_1040885.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614201", "eventUri": "eng-9614201", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 235, "relevance": 1}

(UPDATED) - Business Telegraph", "body": "Benzinga - by Anan Ashraf, Benzinga Editor.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated with details about model years affected and recent Tesla recalls.\n\nThe U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced on Friday that EV giant Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is recalling over 125,000 of its car models due to issues with the deployment of seat belt warnings.\n\nWhat Happened: The NHTSA reported that the seat belt warning light and audible chime, which remind the driver to use the safety feature, might not activate as intended if the driver is not belted. This increases the risk of injury in case of a crash. To resolve this issue, Tesla will deploy a software update at no cost to customers, beginning in June.\n\nFix & Impact: The recall affects both Tesla's mass-market Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, as well as its more premium Model S and Model X. The problem arose due to an open trace in the driver seat occupancy switch. The software update will remove dependency on the switch, relying solely on the driver seat belt buckle and ignition status to activate warnings going forward.\n\nModels and Model Years Affected\n\n2012-2024 Model S 2021-2024 Model X 2017-2024 Model 3 2019-2024 Model Y\n\nAs of May 28, Tesla has identified 104 warranty claims that may be related to the issue. However, the company is not aware of any collisions, fatalities, or injuries related to the problem, according to the NHTSA filing.\n\nWhy It Matters: Earlier this month, the NHTSA closed a year-long probe into over 100,000 Model X SUVs over concerns that seat belts could detach from the outboard lap pretensioner anchor while the vehicle was moving. The investigation was closed after deeming Tesla's recall issued in July sufficient.\n\nLate last month, Tesla also recalled 3,878 Cybertrucks due to concerns of unintentional acceleration. The company offered a free physical repair of the accelerator pedal assembly to resolve the issue.\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by following this link.\n\nRead More: Tesla, Ford Hit The Brakes In UK As Warren Buffett-Backed BYD Zooms Ahead With 2500% Jump In Registrations\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

The issue would be fixed through an over-the-air (OTA) software update.\n\nAs noted in a Part 573 Safety Recall Report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), FMVSS No. 208, S7.3(a)(1) requires short audible and visual seat belt reminder signals to alert drivers that their seat belt is not fastened. In affected Tesla vehicles, the seat belt warning light and audible chime may not activate as intended.\n\nTesla identified the issue on April 18, 2024 as part of the company's internal compliance audit. The vehicle that exhibited the fault was a 2024 model year Tesla Model X that was being tested to UNECE Regulation No. 16. During the tests, the all-electric SUV's seat belt reminder signals did not chime or display.\n\nTesla proceeded to investigate the condition from April 22 to May 14, 2024. As part of the company's ongoing investigation, Tesla developed and ran fleet query analytics to identify how many affected vehicles may be operating with the seat belt warning system issue from May 14 to May 20, 2024. The electric vehicle maker opted to initiate a recall on May 20, 2024. As of May 28, Tesla has identified 104 warranty claims that may be related to the seat belt warning system fault.\n\nSimilar to the majority of Tesla's recalls, affected vehicles would be fixed through an over-the-air software update. Tesla expects to start deploying the software fix to affected vehicles in June 2024. As per the company, the \"software remedy will remove dependency on the driver seat occupancy switch from the software logic and only rely on driver seat belt buckle and ignition status to activate the seat belt reminder signal.\"\n\nThe NHTSA's Safety Recall Report can be viewed below.\n\nRCLRPT-24V376-3527 by Simon Alvarez on Scribd\n\nDon't hesitate to contact us with news tips.

A continuous or intermittent audible signal must activate for not less than four seconds and a visual signal must display for not less than sixty seconds.\n\nOn certain affected vehicles, an open trace in the driver seat occupancy switch may result in a loss of the audible and visual seat belt reminder signals when the driver's seat belt is not fastened after the vehicle ignition is moved to the \"on\" or \"start\" position.\n\nFollowing an investigation, Tesla identified that the seat belt reminder signals did not chime or display.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla said it is not aware of any collisions, fatalities or injuries that may be related to the condition, but it identified 104 warranty claims that may be related to the condition.\n\nTesla confirmed that the affected vehicles will receive an over-the-air (OTA) software remedy, which is expected to begin deploying in June 2024 at no cost to customers.\n\nThe software remedy will remove dependency on the driver seat occupancy switch from the software logic and only rely on driver seat belt buckle and ignition status to activate the seat belt reminder signals.", "source": {"uri": "markets.businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Markets Insider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_belt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seat belt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Highway Traffic Safety Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_X", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model X"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_Y", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model Y"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignition_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ignition system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warranty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warranty"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Specialized_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Specialized Vehicles", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Bathroom", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Bathroom", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device_Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device Drivers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 64}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614201", "eventUri": "eng-9614201", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

The company is recalling 125,227 vehicles due to a problem with the seat belt warning system, Reuters reports. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the driver could be unbuckled, and the warning light and chime still might not activate. This malfunction violates federal safety requirements and could increase a person's injury risk.\n\nThe affected models span the last decade, comprising some of the 2012-2024 Model S, 2015-2024 Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3, and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles. To fix the issue, Tesla will change the sensor from depending on seat weight to whether the buckle is plugged in and the car is turned on. An over-the-air update should begin in June.\n\nTesla notably recalled over two million vehicles in December following Autopilot safety issues and a two-year NHTSA investigation. More recalls followed earlier this year: In January, Tesla recalled 200,000 Model S, X and Y vehicles from 2023 due to a software issue that prevented the backup camera from working when the car is in reverse (so the exact time it's needed). The included vehicles comprised over 10 percent of the company's 2023 output.

(UPDATED) By Benzinga", "body": "Editor's note: This story has been updated with details about model years affected and recent Tesla recalls.\n\nThe U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced on Friday that EV giant Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is recalling over 125,000 of its car models due to issues with the deployment of seat belt warnings.\n\nWhat Happened: The NHTSA reported that the seat belt warning light and audible chime, which remind the driver to use the safety feature, might not activate as intended if the driver is not belted. This increases the risk of injury in case of a crash. To resolve this issue, Tesla will deploy a software update at no cost to customers, beginning in June.\n\nFix & Impact: The recall affects both Tesla's mass-market Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, as well as its more premium Model S and Model X. The problem arose due to an open trace in the driver seat occupancy switch. The software update will remove dependency on the switch, relying solely on the driver seat belt buckle and ignition status to activate warnings going forward.\n\nModels and Model Years Affected\n\nWhy It Matters: Earlier this month, the NHTSA closed a year-long probe into over 100,000 Model X SUVs over concerns that seat belts could detach from the outboard lap pretensioner anchor while the vehicle was moving. The investigation was closed after deeming Tesla's recall issued in July sufficient.\n\nLate last month, Tesla also recalled 3,878 Cybertrucks due to concerns of unintentional acceleration. The company offered a free physical repair of the accelerator pedal assembly to resolve the issue.\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by following this link.\n\nRead More: Tesla, Ford Hit The Brakes In UK As Warren Buffett-Backed BYD Zooms Ahead With 2500% Jump In Registrations\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_belt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seat belt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Highway Traffic Safety Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Model year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_Y", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model Y"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_X", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model X"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Auto", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BYD Auto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignition_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ignition system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Throttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acceleration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warren, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Models", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Models", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Models", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Boats_and_Ships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Boats and Ships", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEA9907F_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614201", "eventUri": "eng-9614201", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

As well as being a sensible safety addition, they're also a legal requirement, and Tesla has been forced to recall thousands of EVs in the U.S. because their warning systems aren't working.\n\nOfficial paperwork from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reveals that 125,227 Teslas are being recalled after it was discovered that the audio and visual alerts designed to remind a driver that their seatbelt wasn't fastened might be rendered inactive due to a faulty occupancy sensor in the seat.\n\nRelated: Tesla Bug Silences Pedestrian Warning System On 6,500+ EVs, But OTA Fix Coming\n\nThough the number of affected cars is relatively low, the production date range is vast, stretching between 2012 and 2024 for the Model S, for instance, seemingly because only vehicles running a certain kind of seat belt reminder logic suffered a problem. Other affected cars are the 2016-2024 Model X, 2017-23 Model 3, and 2020-23 Model Y.\n\nTesla's solution is to introduce new software that removes the system's dependency on the faulty ass-weighing occupancy switch and instead relies only on the data showing whether the seatbelt is latched when the ignition is activated before deciding whether or not to start berating the driver for not buckling-up. This means drivers with a death wish who've got used to not wearing a belt can do what their forefathers did in the 1970s and 1980s and just buckle it behind them.\n\nSince Tesla's fix is a simple software update, it will be handled via an over-air update and won't require owners to visit a service center.

As it happens, the seatbelt audible chime and warning light may not activate as intended in the event of an unbelted driver. As with most recalls involving Tesla vehicles, the remedy comes in the form of an over-the-air software update. However, by law, Tesla is required to inform affected customers about said recall via first-class mail. Notification letters will be mailed no later than July 27.\n\nAs for the reason why the audible and visual seatbelt reminder signals don't activate as intended, the electric vehicle manufacturer says that an open trace in the driver seat occupancy switch is to blame. FMVSS 208 S7.3 requires the signals to activate for not less than when the ignition is moved to either the on or start position and the driver's seatbelt is not fastened.\n\nTesla identified this issue on April 18 as part of a compliance audit involving a Model X. The subsequent investigation determined that 104 warranty claims had been filed with the company for said noncompliance. In Model S and Model X production, the problem was remedied on April 29 with the introduction of a test for verifying the functionality of the driver seat occupancy switch. As for the smaller Model 3 and Model Y, that would be November 15, 2023.\n\nThe affected population comprises 125,227 electric vehicles produced for the 2012 through 2024 model years from October 16, 2012 through April 29, 2024. The supplier of the driver seatbelt reminder sensor is I.G. Bauerhin GmbH of Germany, whereas seatbelt reminder software logic was developed by Tesla.\n\nPhoto: Tesla During the first quarter of 2024, the company produced 433,371 vehicles and delivered 386,810 vehicles worldwide as opposed to 440,808 and 422,875, respectively, in the first quarter of 2023. The manufacturer explains the decline in deliveries with the early phase of the production ramp of the refreshed Model 3 in Fremont. Factory shutdowns caused by shipping diversions also need to be mentioned. Lest we forget the Red Sea conflict and the arson attack at Giga Berlin.\n\nOther than the fleet-oriented Tesla Semi battery electric semi-trailer truck, the manufacturer offers five distinct passenger vehicles, beginning with the Model Y. The world's best-selling electric vehicle is expected to follow in the footsteps of the Model 3 Highland with the Juniper update. Initially rumored to drop by the end of 2024, the Model Y Juniper was allegedly postponed to early 2025.\n\nPrices start at $44,990 for the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive, $47,990 for the dual-motor version, and $51,490 for the Performance. The sleeker Model 3 sedan is listed at $38,990 for the Rear-Wheel Drive, but the one to have is the $47,740 Long Range All-Wheel Drive due to its 341-mile (549 kilometers) range.\n\nThe Model S, however, is Tesla's longest-range production vehicle as of May 2024. It promises up to 359 miles (578 kilometers), while the Model X tops 326 miles (525 kilometers).", "source": {"uri": "autoevolution.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "autoevolution"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mircea_panait@autoevolution.com", "name": "Mircea Panait", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_X", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model X"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_belt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seat belt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_Y", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model Y"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-air_update", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over-the-air update"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motor vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignition_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ignition system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warranty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warranty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Motor_Vehicle_Safety_Standards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Model year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigafactory_Berlin-Brandenburg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-trailer_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semi-trailer truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fremont, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fremont, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Models", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Boats_and_Ships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Boats and Ships", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/tesla-recalls-125000-vehicles-over-seatbelt-warning-system-malfunction-234756_1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614201", "eventUri": "eng-9614201", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-27", "textStart": 624, "textEnd": 631}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-18", "textStart": 1043, "textEnd": 1051}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 1287, "textEnd": 1295}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-10-16", "textStart": 1583, "textEnd": 1599}, {"amb": false, "date": "2015-11-", "textStart": 1451, "textEnd": 1462}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The electric vehicle (EV) giant is reportedly planning to issue recall orders for around 1.25 lakh units in the US market owing to a possible fault in the seat-belt warning systems.\n\nNews agency Reuters reports US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has confirmed Tesla will have to recall these EVs because the seat-belt warning light and audio chime may not be working as intended when a person inside is unbelted. The NHTSA is a federal agency that is tasked with safety of people across US' road network.\n\nAs per NHTSA, the recall order from Tesla will affect EV models like Model S manufactured between 2012 and 2024, Model X between 2015 and 2024, Model 3 between 2017 and 2023 and Model Y between 2020 and 2023. That, essentially, almost entirely covers the product portfolio of the Elon Musk-led company.\n\nAlso Read : How Chinese EV companies plan to challenge Tesla in Europe\n\nThe fix for the potential fault, however, may not be elaborate as Tesla is expected to release an Over-the-Air (OTA) software update as a solution. But what this could potentially do is impact Tesla's image at a time when the rivalry in the EV space is hotting up by several degrees.\n\nSales of electric cars have not been rising as quickly as was previously expected. The last few months of 2023 and the first quater of 2024 was not too peachy for EV manufacturers across the world. Experts say that while enthusiastic first-time EV buyers have made their purchases, the mass-market consumers are far more price conscious and would be more tepid with their decisions.\n\nIn the US, around 10.60 lakh EVs were sold in all of 2023, up by 60 per cent from a year earlier. But while the growth is predicted to persist, the trajectory of the sales graph rise is likely to taper down in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "auto.hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://auto.hindustantimes.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ht_auto_desk@auto.hindustantimes.com", "name": "Ht Auto Desk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Highway Traffic Safety Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "News agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_Y", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model Y"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_X", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model X"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrestrial television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Models", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Models", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Models", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Boats_and_Ships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Boats and Ships", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/auto/img/2024/05/31/1600x900/TESLA-PROBE--0_1717149863293_1717149884152.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614201", "eventUri": "eng-9614201", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

The Tesla vehicles facing the recall had signals going off at improper times, the NHTSA said in a report released Thursday.\n\nThis recall contributes to the company's 2.5 million recalls issued this year so far.\n\nIn January, Tesla recalled certain 2023 Y, S and X model vehicles due to a software issue that prevented the camera image from showing images while the Teslas are in reverse.

We will now have to wait until July 11 \u2013 after the election \u2013 to hear the regulator\u2019s verdict. By then we may have a new government, a new parliament, and a new prime minister \u2013 and we simply can\u2019t afford to have the same old broken water system. From our waters overflowing with sewage and agricultural waste, to regular service outages, the sector\u2019s abject failure could not be more blindingly obvious. Last year, water companies discharged raw sewage into our waters for a record 3.6million hours \u2013 105% worse than the year before. This is not only an environmental disaster of epic, and growing, proportions, it\u2019s also a serious public health emergency \u2013 as the thousands of households in Devon currently battling an outbreak from contaminated water can attest. Now, we read that Ofwat is considering allowing firms to avoid the high fines they deserve in order to help \u2018struggling\u2019 firms. And these are the same companies that say if we want them to do anything to improve this dire state of affairs, then it\u2019s ordinary bill payers who are going to have to stump up the cash.

According to figures from the consumer watchdog, even the smallest demand is for an eye-watering increase of 24%. But it is the companies with the most shockingly poor performance of all that want to put up their customers\u2019 bills most of all. Thames Water, which is already teetering on the brink of insolvency after paying out \u00a37billion in dividends over the last three decades, now want their customers to pick up the tab by putting bills up by an average of \u00a3749 a year \u2013 up 59%. Top of the charts, or rather bottom, is Southern Water, who want to put bills up an obscene 91%. These companies have us over a barrel \u2013 and don\u2019t they just know it. They\u2019re fully aware that the toothless regulator has no power to hold them to account \u2013 and now apparently plans to let them off fines. Our rivers and seas are an environmental crisis (Picture: Getty) And they know that their customers have zero choice about their water supplier \u2013 it\u2019s not like they can vote with their wallet, shop around, and go elsewhere. That\u2019s why, despite their shockingly poor performance, these companies think they can get away with continuing to turn the screws and milking the public cash cow dry. In an election year, we can\u2019t let them. Because how dare these companies ask the very people they\u2019ve let down so badly, in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, to pick up the tab for their negligence and financial mismanagement? These greedy companies have racked up debts of over \u00a364bn since they were privatised debt-free under Thatcher, deliberately using the revenue from customer bills to pay out \u00a378bn in shareholder dividends, rather than investing enough in infrastructure. Now they are taking us all for fools and demanding yet more money to line their shareholders\u2019 pockets? It\u2019s an outrage that cannot be allowed to continue. That\u2019s why, before the election was called, I joined a group of nearly 40 MPs to write to Ofwat boss, David Black, demanding they rule out any above-inflation increase to customers\u2019 bills until performance is improved. Nor should they be allowed to pay out any more dividends until shareholders put new equity into financing infrastructure improvements. But ultimately, we have to recognise just how much of a monumental failure the whole concept of privatising our water has proven. An incoming administration, no matter what party, should place every company in Special Administration as we move to end this legalised scam and, as a first step, bring our water back into public ownership. The writing is already on the wall for water companies (Picture: Getty Images) First, because only if it\u2019s under democratic control, can we make sure that this public good is run for the benefit of people and the planet, not shareholder profits. Second, because this is even more important as we enter an era of more extreme weather of droughts and floods. A resilient water system is an issue of national security. And third, because if the public are being asked to pay for water infrastructure upgrades ourselves, we should at least own the assets, rather than yet again allowing shareholders to just take all the profits. The writing is already on the wall for our failing water companies. The public have had enough of this disastrous Thatcherite experiment. A 2022 survey showed that 58% of Conservative voters and 80% of Labour supporters now want to see water back in public hands. Yet so far, the Green Party is the only party committed to public ownership. Despite recognising the need to renationalise the railways, Labour have yet to make the same promise for our water, although there are plenty of MPs crying out for Starmer to do so. Because if he does become the country\u2019s next Prime Minister, tinkering around the edges isn\u2019t going to be enough. This crisis isn\u2019t going anywhere \u2013 and Labour need to wake up, step in and finally bring the fiasco of water privatisation to an end. Do you have a story you\u2019d like to share?

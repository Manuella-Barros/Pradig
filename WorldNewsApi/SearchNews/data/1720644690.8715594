Rizwan said that he has played SRK's body double in a handful of films, as he recalled the difficulties that he has experienced because of the gig economy. Appearing on the web show Dumb Biryani, hosted by Arhaan Khan, Rizwan said that none other than Arhaan's uncle, Salman Khan, helped him and several other celebrity lookalikes when things became difficult financially during the pandemic. He said, \"During the pandemic, things became so bad that I had to sell off some of my belongings because I didn't have money for food. My wife was pregnant at the time, and there was no work. We have a union for celebrity lookalikes, through which Salman Khan sent Rs 2,500 to each member, along with ration. I'd like to really thank him for that gesture. And now, by the grace of God, I have a 2 BHK house, and everything that I had to sell during the pandemic I have bought again.\" Also read - \u2018Shah Rukh Khan called me after my team invaded his privacy,\u2019 paparazzo reveals why SRK started avoiding media: \u2018I realised his love for his children\u2019 Rizwan, who hails from Kalyan, said that he used work at roadside stalls at one point, but became a full-time celebrity lookalike after moving to Mumbai.

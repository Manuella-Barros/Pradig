{"id": 231959876, "title": "Migrant woman searches for husband who has vanished, a common occurrence as men struggle to find jobs", "text": "During Jessica Juma\u2019s first week of work, her husband disappeared. For nearly six months, the husband and wife from a rural Ecuadorian town had struggled to find jobs in Chicago. They had gone to clinics and panhandled in front of grocery stores. But then, the 36-year-old mother found a therapist, who helped soothe her trauma and obtain the right paperwork to work legally. When she was offered a job packing fruits and vegetables at Mariano\u2019s in Lakeview, her husband told her he was happy she was working. But the 37-year-old still hadn\u2019t found a job himself. The stress was taking a toll. On May 25, as Juma worked inside the store, her husband panhandled outside with the couple\u2019s 15-year-old son, 19-year-old daughter and 6-month-old grandchild. A little before 8:30 a.m., he told the teens he was going to buy some new shoes. Then he left and never came back. \u201cIt was like normal. Everything was normal, but we never heard from him again,\u201d Juma said. Since his disappearance, Juma has spent weeks in a daze, holding back tears. She\u2019s walked along the lakefront, calling his name \u2014 Angel Mashiant. She\u2019s filed a missing person\u2019s report and approached police cars to ask for help. She\u2019s gotten no answers from police and doesn\u2019t know what to do. Though it\u2019s uncertain what happened to Juma\u2019s husband, the migrant mother represents a common phenomenon for new arrivals: After traveling thousands of miles to make it to the U.S., some migrant men seemingly walk out or vanish from the lives of their partners and children, leaving them to fend for themselves. As more than 43,000 migrants have passed through Chicago, sent on buses and planes from the southern border since August 2022, hundreds of single mothers with children can be found staying in the 17 shelters run by the city and state. It\u2019s unclear how many had arrived with partners. The women who have been left are now trying to find work while raising their children \u2014 all without the help of their partners. Licensed therapists and those working closely with migrants say the frustration and shame felt by men of not being able to provide for their families may be a factor in their choice to just walk away. \u201cWe see cases like that,\u201d said Ana Gil-Garcia, founder of the Illinois Venezuelan Alliance, who has led informational sessions for migrants at dozens of shelters across the city. \u201cWhen men can\u2019t provide, they decide to leave. They don\u2019t take responsibility \u2014 and then mom is left with the children.\u201d \u2018I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to establish myself here alone\u2019 Nareida Santana, 37, from Cartagena, Colombia, stood outside a migrant shelter in the West Loop Tuesday and recounted how she and her partner traveled for days across six countries to reach Chicago at the end of April. About two weeks ago, she said, he suddenly left. She doesn\u2019t know where he went. She shifted her weight back and forth as she talked. She has a 7-year-old boy and now has to do everything alone. The tasks stack up: enrolling him in school, navigating public transit, finding work and housing. \u201cI\u2019m so scared,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to establish myself here alone.\u201d Santana said she knows there are women whose husbands have left them who are in worse situations than she is, who are pregnant or have significant health needs. She said shelter workers are giving her guidance on how to interview for jobs, but it will be useless until she gets a valid work permit. For now, she\u2019s tirelessly trying to find work so she can move out of the shelter. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to rest much in there,\u201d she said, gesturing to the brick warehouse sheltering over 700 migrants on five floors. Veronica Sanchez, a licensed social worker, led a series of healing circles for migrants at the Parent University in Pilsen this spring through an effort organized by the mutual aid group Southwest Collective. Sanchez said migrants talked openly about the trend of men leaving their wives. As volunteers supplied hot meals and child care in a separate room, adult asylum-seekers engaged in group therapies, with topics ranging from anxiety and depression to traditional gender roles. Sanchez said many have been so focused on getting their basic needs met they haven\u2019t had the time to think about their mental health. In some cases, she said, this leads to last-minute separations. \u201cWe discussed a little bit about depression at the beginning,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI told them we were going to talk very openly about any sadness they might be feeling.\u201d At a group session in mid-May, Sanchez led a discussion about what constitutes a healthy relationship. \u201cI\u2019ve seen couples that have been together for many years, and they arrive here and it changes everything,\u201d said a woman from Venezuela whose name is not being used out of privacy concerns. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard here, but how can they not remember everything they\u2019ve been through?\u201d \u2018Not my American dream\u2019 The city couldn\u2019t immediately provide the current number of single migrant women with children in its shelters, though it does track family composition in the shelter system. City officials said case managers refer shelter residents to nonprofits for mental health support. Additionally, the city trains hundreds of shelter staff on how to provide support for women who may experience gender-based violence, including domestic violence. \u201cMayor Johnson believes that all Chicagoans deserve mental and behavioral healthcare, whether they just arrived or they have been here for generations,\u201d a city spokesperson said in a statement. Yoleida Ramirez, a 42-year-old single mother from Caracas, Venezuela, who is staying at the same shelter as Juma on the Lower West Side, said she has searched and applied for stable work in Chicago since November but hasn\u2019t found anything. She and her three little girls were placed in a shelter in December, and the staff recently told Ramirez that she needs to find her own housing by June 23. She\u2019s worried she won\u2019t be able to. \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult,\u201d she said, through tears. \u201cI\u2019ve looked and looked, but can\u2019t find a job.\u201d After she drops her kids off at school at 7 a.m., she goes to Home Depot and prays she can find work painting or cleaning. She left her home country because she couldn\u2019t find work there either, she said. She didn\u2019t have enough money to buy her children food. \u201cI\u2019d heard about the American dream, but this is not my dream,\u201d she said. The disappearance The last morning Juma saw her husband, she said they woke up early in the shelter and he teased her that she was going to be late for her work shift at Mariano\u2019s. She put on an apron and he passed her a pair of socks and $2 for the bus, she said. Mashiant panhandled outside Mariano\u2019s with their family while Juma worked inside. He told his kids to wait while he got new shoes. He put his hood up and walked past the dumpsters. He hasn\u2019t been seen since. When Juma got back from her shift, she and her children waited. He always came back, she said. But hours passed and there was no sign of him. She filed a police report the next day. Weeks later, the lack of closure is painful for Juma. She\u2019s still in denial that he\u2019s gone. She\u2019s had trouble confirming that police have processed her missing person report because when she calls to check on it, the people who answer only speak English. She thinks they\u2019ve given up searching for Mashiant. A spokesman for the Chicago Police Department told the Tribune in a statement that, \u201cThe report has not been finalized at this time. We do not have access to most missing persons reports because they are done on paper.\u201d Juma said the shelter told her on June 2 that because Mashiant had disappeared, she would lose her place in the system. They\u2019ve since rescinded that, she said, but Juma cries when she talks about it. \u201cThey told me they were going to take his cot away,\u201d she said. She\u2019s done everything she can to look for him. She put posters on lamps near the grocery store. She obtained video footage from a nearby business, which shows him swinging his arms and eyeing something in the distance as he walks through the alley. But she has no answers. She can\u2019t talk about him without crying. She wonders if he may have tried to drown himself in the lake. She wanders along the shore looking for signs of his floating body. \u2018He wasn\u2019t in his right mind\u2019 Like many migrants who have come to the city to escape poverty and violence in Latin America, Juma and her family don\u2019t know anyone in Chicago. The transition was difficult, she said, and they\u2019ve received backlash for panhandling. \u201cThere was a man who threw food at us, and said he hoped Trump won so we would be deported to our country,\u201d she said. Juma said their family left their small agricultural community in Ecuador in late September after her 19-year-old and 15-year-old faced back-to-back acts of gang violence. Their family received increasingly threatening calls, so they decided to leave Ecuador. They arrived in Chicago in December. On the way here, she and her husband and son were kidnapped in Mexico for five days, she said. Before her husband went missing, Juma had unpacked her difficult past with Erika Meza, a licensed master social worker with Onward House in Belmont Cragin who leads group therapy sessions with migrants. Meza said she has an especially close relationship with Juma. For months, Meza said, the Ecuadorian mother had expressed anxiety over not having a stable income. Shelter officials were threatening to evict them from the shelter where Juma is currently staying. Meza said she helped the couple submit their paperwork to work legally in the United States, but Mashiant was still applying for jobs. \u201cHe was beginning to get really sad, staying at the shelter,\u201d Meza said. Juma told her husband to go to group therapy, too, because she said it helped her to understand and cope with her depression, but he hadn\u2019t gone. Meza suspects Mashiant left in a moment of panic. \u201cI think he wasn\u2019t in his right mind,\u201d she said. \u201cDepression and anxiety can bring you to do things you could never imagine.\u201d Still searching Juma\u2019s husband was a quiet man who grew up in the jungle in Ecuador. He couldn\u2019t read and write. Other women at the shelter say he must have left with another woman, but Juma says she knows that\u2019s not true because he doesn\u2019t know anybody here. \u201cThe only thing I need is for him to appear so I can pay for a place for us to go. Those were our plans. We planned to work, to pay for a place for us to live,\u201d she said. Like many others, Juma is now left to do everything alone. She has to work and pick up her son from school. Wednesday morning, a woman who cleans the streets outside Mariano\u2019s told Juma that she could take the bus west to the last stop where there was a lake. Juma loaded her grandchild in a carriage up onto the CTA bus. She rode it to the last stop, dismounted and looked around. \u201cIs there a lake near here?\u201d she said, confused. She was 5 miles from Lake Michigan. Slowly the reality set in. Her face dropped. She waited at the bus stop to go back to the Mariano\u2019s where her husband first disappeared.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/migrant-woman-searches-husband-vanished-100000161.html", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/egxkeXPSDR5.62n7q8kZvQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/chicago_tribune_local_801/08f7e6f5775e0a34780c98f7f6fb073c", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:03:33", "author": "Nell Salzman, Chicago Tribune", "authors": ["Nell Salzman, Chicago Tribune"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.199}

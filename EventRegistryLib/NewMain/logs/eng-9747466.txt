Passengers were drinking rum and whiskey, according to a witness, which may have come into contact with the flammable substance, causing the fire.\n\n\"Desperate measures\"\n\nMigration from the poverty-stricken Caribbean country has been surging for months, as thousands of people flee a spike in violence from criminal gangs that now control wide swaths of territory.\n\n\"Haiti's socioeconomic situation is in agony,\" said Gregoire Goodstein, IOM's chief of mission in the country. \"The extreme violence over the past months has only brought Haitians to resort to desperate measures even more.\"\n\nHundreds of police officers from Kenya have deployed in Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince, part of an international effort to bring stability to a country riven by political, social and economic chaos.\n\nCriminal gangs now control 80 percent of the capital city, with residents saying they have faced murder, rape, theft and kidnapping for ransom.\n\nSince February 29, Haitian Coast Guard units in the north have observed an increasing number of departures by boat, the IOM said.\n\nCountries including the United States, the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and Jamaica say they have intercepted a growing number of boats originating from Haiti. Last month, 118 Haitian migrants were picked up by U.S. Border Patrol agents on Key West after coming ashore.\n\nMore than 86,000 migrants have been forcibly returned to Haiti by neighboring countries this year, according to the IOM.\n\nLast month, the IOM said data showed over 578,000 people were internally displaced across Haiti, a 60% increase since March.\n\n\"The unending crisis in Haiti is pushing more and more people to flee their homes and leave everything behind,\" Philippe Branchat, head of the IOM in Haiti, said in a statement. \"This is not something they do lightly.

Armed gangs have exacerbated the situation by coordinating attacks, including control over police stations and disrupting the main airport.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missing person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turks_and_Caicos_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turks and Caicos Islands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turks and Caicos Islands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_captain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sea captain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coast guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap-Ha\u00eftien", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cap-Ha\u00eftien"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cap-Ha\u00eftien"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Displacement (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whisky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failed_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Failed state"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Wooden_Boats", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Wooden Boats", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/19_07_2024_15_39_27_6982359.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747466", "eventUri": "eng-9747466", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The boat had initially departed from Fort Saint Michel, a seaside community in the city of Cap-Ha\u00eftien, near the international airport.\n\nAfter leaving Cap-Ha\u00eftien the boat made a stop at Picolet, off Labadie, several Haitians told the Miami Herald. The area is considered sacred and before the risky migrant journey, boat captains from Cap-Ha\u00eftien routinely stop there to seek help from Vodou spirits for a safe and undetected journey. The secret ritual usually involves rum.\n\n\"When they arrived they started pouring rum and wine into the ocean and they lit candles. There were two drums filled with gasoline and they exploded,\" said Jean-Henry Petit, who is responsible for the Office of Civil Protection for northern Haiti.\n\nPetit said some of the survivors blamed the tragedy on the use of wine in the ceremony, which is considered a bad omen because it symbolizes blood . He said there were as many as 80 Haitians onboard, according to survivors.\n\nThe use of Vodou in clandestine boat voyages is common and often credited for Haitians' safe and undetected arrival at their destination. The details of the intricate rituals are a closely held secret. But generally, Vodou faithfuls say the ceremonies can include drumming , chanting and paying homage to the Vodou spirit Agw\u00e9, who they believe rules the sea. Sometimes Haitian rum is poured, a citrus-scented cologne named Florida Water is sprayed, and a chicken is sacrificed.\n\nThe International Organization for Migration, a United Nations agency, said 40 Haitians are presumed to have died at sea and 41 others were rescued. The boat was headed to the Turks and Caicos Islands, a British Overseas Territory about 155 miles from Haiti. A popular tourist destination, the island-chain is also popular among Haitians seeking to escape their country's deadly gang violence and opting not to risk the longer, riskier voyage to the Florida coast.\n\n\"Haiti's socioeconomic situation is in agony. The extreme violence over the past months has only brought Haitians to resort to desperate measures even more,\" Gr\u00e9goire Goodstein, Haiti chief of mission for the agency.\n\nGoodstein said the tragedy \"highlights the risks faced by children, women and men migrating through irregular routes\" and underscores the crucial need for safe and legal pathways for migration.\n\nSurvivors said that while there were originally 60 people aboard the boat, it took on additional individuals as it was being loaded. The passengers were initially rescued by another boat that had departed from Port-de-Paix in the northwest before Haitian Coast Guard was notified and completed the rescue, Haitian authorities said. At least 11 people were initially hospitalized, but as of Friday, only one person had not yet been discharged.\n\nHaitians face a lack of economic opportunities, a collapsing health system and school closures. The lack of prospects, along with the ongoing gang violence and kidnappings that are spreading beyond Port-au-Prince are pushing many to consider fleeing the country. A 2023 research by the organization for migration found that 84% of migrants who had been returned to Haiti had left to seek job opportunities abroad.\n\nWith visa services suspended by the U.S. embassy, legal migration has become \"an extremely challenging journey to consider, let alone pursue,\" the United Nations agency noted, leaving many Haitians to view risky, irregular migration as their only option.\n\nAfter several powerful armed gangs in Port-au-Prince united and began launching coordinated attacks in late February, the Haitian Coast Guard in the north has noted an increase in the number of boat departures. Coast guards from countries in the region, including the United States, The Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and Jamaica, have also reported a growing number of boats intercepted at sea carrying Haitians.\n\nLate Thursday, the United State Coast Guard and Royal Bahamas Defense Force announced the suspension of a search for 60 Haitian migrants who presumably left The Bahamas bound for Florida.\n\nLast year, the Turks and Caicos reported interdicting 4,016 migrants at sea. So far this year 865 undocumented migrants have been interdicted at as of June 25, said Denyse Renne, a spokeswoman with the Royal Turks and Caicos police. Though the island-chain is seeing an overall reduction in undocumented migrants interdicted at sea, U.N data shows that the number of Haitians being returned from the British territory is on the rise.\n\nAccording to the U.N. migration agency, more than 86,000 people have been forcibly returned to Haiti by neighboring countries this year, 13,000 just in March alone. The majority of the returns are from the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.\n\nThe U.N. migration group \"is concerned about the high number of forced returns of Haitians during this current period of civil unrest and uncertainty,\" the agency said. \"Forced returns must occur in a dignified manner. Many migrants forcibly returned, including unaccompanied and separated children as well as pregnant and nursing women, arrive in Haiti in highly vulnerable conditions, often with few resources. They urgently need humanitarian assistance after facing numerous health and protection concerns during their journeys.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

The number of migration attempts by boat from Haiti have risen since then, according to IOM data.\n\nBut chaos in the country has not stopped neighboring governments from repatriating Haitian migrants by the tens of thousands.\n\n\"More than 86,000 migrants have been forcibly returned to Haiti by neighboring countries this year. In March, despite a surge in violence and the closure of airports throughout the country, forced returns increased by 46 per cent, reaching 13,000 forced returns in March alone,\" the agency said in its statement.\n\nIn recent weeks, the appointment of new Prime Minister Garry Conille and the arrival of several hundred foreign forces to bolster Haiti's National Police have offered new hope for addressing the crisis.

Earlier this year, coordinated gang attacks rocked the country's capital, Port-au-Prince, forcing the closure of its airport for nearly three months. Since then, nearly 580,000 Haitians have been displaced, according to the U.N.\n\n\"This devastating event highlights the risks faced by children, women, and men migrating through irregular routes, demonstrating the crucial need for safe and legal pathways for migration,\" Gr\u00e9goire Goodstein, the head of the U.N's International Organization for Migration in Haiti, said in a statement on Friday.\n\nHe said that Haiti's socioeconomic situation was dire and that the \"extreme violence\" over the past months has pushed Haitians to resort to \"desperate measures even more.\"\n\nThe first wave of foreign law enforcement officers from Kenya arrived in Haiti late last month to try and wrest control of Port-au-Prince from dozens of armed groups that have attacked police stations, freed prisoners and killed with impunity.\n\nHaiti has been without a president since the assassination in July 2021 of Jovenel Mo\u00efse by armed men who broke into his bedroom and gunned him down in front of his wife. His murder is still under separate investigations in Haiti and Florida.\n\nAmid the surge in violence, Ariel Henry resigned as prime minister in late April. In late May, Garry Conille, a former U.N. official, was appointed prime minister by a presidential transitional council.

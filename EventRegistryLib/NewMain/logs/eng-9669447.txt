Not only did former President Donald Trump publicly meet with two of the country's toughest men, pro-Kremlin outlets report he pledged to help Russia end the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe claim emerged from Trump's unexpected meeting with notorious Russian UFC stars -- and \"Putin's friends\" -- Khabib Nurmagomedov and Islam Makhachev. The controversial MMA fighters took the opportunity to talk international diplomacy with the once and -- possibly -- future leader of the free world.\n\nTrump \"promised Nurmagomedov to stop the war in Ukraine,\" according to news reports trumpeted by major Russian news agencies and television channels.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin outlined the kind of ludicrously one-sided settlement it would take for him to call a ceasefire just last week, and the Kremlin hopes Trump will try to bully Ukraine into accepting it if he is re-elected in November.\n\nRussian outreach is now focused on encouraging Trump to do just that. And, of course, the Kremlin will do whatever it can to help him win.\n\nThe meeting in New Jersey between Trump and the UFC stars was labelled \"historic\" by the Russian media and it opens yet another potential backchannel between Trump and Putin.\n\n\"We are very proud that our heroes go to America, meet with the future president Trump and that he promises them to finish the war in Ukraine,\" Magomed, a former law enforcement official from Dagestan told The Daily Beast. \"Putin must be very happy, he has fatherly feelings for Khabib.\"\n\nNurmagomedov is the most-followed Russian on Instagram. He was named Russia's No.1 athlete in 2019 before retiring from UFC without ever suffering a defeat (29-0) and has remained hugely popular despite regular controversies.\n\nThe fighter from Dagestan, a republic inside Russia, was banned for nine months after sparking a brawl in Las Vegas after beating Connor McGregor and then leaping out of the octagon to attack members of the Irishman's team. Nurmagomedov later said they had insulted his religion. He is a follower of Islam, who reportedly has an \"ultra-conservative worldview,\" which has led to him speaking out against nightclubs and risqu\u00e9 plays back home. Nurmagomedov and Makhachev, who is also from Dagestan, have both claimed that women should not be allowed to compete in UFC.\n\nThe two men, who are met at the airport by adoring fans when they return to Dagestan, where women are not allowed to sit down for a meal with men and where parents still practice the genital mutilation on young girls, also both use the Islamic raised index finger gesture that was co-opted by ISIS in their propaganda material.\n\n\"Both Makhachev and Khabib can be seen with that gesture -- it symbolizes the belief in the oneness of God,\" Alexander Cherakov, a human rights defender at the Nobel Peace Prize winning Memorial told The Daily Beast. \"That is a gesture Salafi or Wahhabi Muslims show in Northern Caucuses, which would mean nothing to Trump of course -- he just sees two tough guys, he thinks of himself as of a tough guy and hopes they would pass his messages to more Russian tough guys.\"\n\nFundamentalist Salafi and Wahhabi preaching is considered extremism by the Russian authorities and there has been a crackdown by the Kremlin over the past decade but that has not stopped Putin cozying up to the athletes.\n\nSoon after Nurmagomedov's controversial victory over McGregor, Putin invited the No.1 ranked fighter to meet him and backed his riot-inducing misbehavior. \"If we are attacked from the outside, all of us can jump out like that,\" he explained. The two men embraced, much like Trump did this month, posing for photographs side by side with their hands clasped together.\n\nPutin personally called Khabib in 2020, after his father, died allegedly from COVID-19 at the age of 57. Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov had trained Khabib since childhood, including having him wrestle a bear cub from the age of 9 in remarkable footage which has since gone viral online. His father, a Russian military veteran, who raised his son in the mountainous back woods of the Caucuses, went on to train Makhachev as his boy's successor.\n\nPutin has long cultivated the habit of hanging out with young tough guys in order to bolster his own macho image, and Trump has clearly picked up the classic \"strongman\" trope.\n\nSince his meeting with Nurmagomedov, Trump has been lavishing him with praise, describing him on Truth Social as \"probably the Greatest Fighter of All Time. I met him at the UFC event on Saturday night in New Jersey. A really smart guy - Big things in the future for Khabib!\"\n\nHe returned to the subject last week on Logan Paul's podcast. \"I thought he was great. We got to speak, he's just about my favorite guy. Really talented.\"\n\nGrigory Shvedov, Russia based editor-in-chief of Caucasus Knot, says that Khabib \"is very influential, he is a thought leader.\" He explained that the Kremlin pays close attention to people like Makhachev and Nurmagomedov \"so they would not have any critical attitude for the authorities.\" The KGB was always sure to cultivate a close, controlling relationship with any Russian athletes who rose to the international level and it is certain that the FSB now does similar with the current generation of global sports stars. It is unknown whether that relationship would stretch as far as asking them to pass on messages to people like Trump.\n\nThe Dagestani icons are also close to the notorious warlord turned head of the neighboring Russian republic Chechnya. Ramzan Kadyrov, also known as \"Putin's Soldier,\" is the most violent and brutal leader in the Northern Caucasus and has been accused of countless human rights abuses, anti-LGBT purges, and the oppression of his people.\n\nKadyrov loves to hang out with the fighters for pictures in his marble palace in Grozny, and has handed over gifts such including a Mercedes S-Class.\n\nThe meeting took place at UFC 302, which is managed by Trump's friend Dana White. At a time when Russian athletes are banned from taking part in the Paris Olympics, Makhachev was top of the bill at the June 2 event.\n\nMuch like Trump, White clearly doesn't see Putin as an enemy. He previously said Putin \"would be more than welcome to come\" to a UFC event in Moscow.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [],

Not only did former President Donald Trump publicly meet with two of the country's toughest men, pro-Kremlin media outlets report that he pledged to help Russia end the war in Ukraine.\n\nThis claim arose from Trump's unexpected meeting with famous Russian UFC stars and Putin friends Khabib Nurmagomedov and Islam Makhachev. The controversial MMA fighters took the opportunity to discuss international diplomacy with the former and perhaps future leader of the free world.\n\nTrump promised Nurmagomedov to end the war in Ukraine, according to reports from major Russian news agencies and television channels.\n\nLast week, President Vladimir Putin described the kind of ridiculously one-sided settlement it would take for him to call a ceasefire, and the Kremlin hopes Trump will try to convince Ukraine to accept it if he is re-elected in November.\n\nRussian action is now aimed at encouraging Trump to do just that. And of course, the Kremlin will do everything in its power to help him win.\n\nThe New Jersey meeting between Trump and UFC stars was called historic by Russian media and it opens yet another potential channel between Trump and Putin.\n\nWe are very proud that our heroes are going to America, meeting the future President Trump and he is promising them to end the war in Ukraine, Magomed, a former law enforcement official from Dagestan, told the Daily Beast. Putin must be very happy, he has paternal feelings for Khabib.\n\nNurmagomedov is the most followed Russian on Instagram. He was named Russia's No. 1 athlete in 2019 before retiring from the UFC without ever suffering a defeat (29-0) and has remained extremely popular despite regular controversies.\n\nThe fighter from Dagestan, a republic inside Russia, was suspended for nine months after starting a brawl in Las Vegas after beating Connor McGregor and then jumping out of the octagon to attack members of the US team. Irish. Nurmagomedov later said they had insulted his religion. He is a follower of Islam, said to have an ultra-conservative worldview, which has led him to denounce nightclubs and risky gambling in his country. Nurmagomedov and Makhachev, also from Dagestan, have both said women should not be allowed to compete in the UFC.\n\nThe two men, greeted at the airport by adoring fans upon their return to Dagestan, where women are not allowed to sit down for a meal with men and where parents still practice genital mutilation of young girls, use also both the Islamic gesture of the raised index finger which has been co-opted by ISIS in its propaganda material.\n\nMakhachev and Khabib can be seen with this gesture which symbolizes belief in the oneness of God, Alexander Cherakov, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning human rights advocate at the Memorial, told the Daily Beast. This is a gesture that Salafi or Wahhabi Muslims are making in the North Caucasus, which would mean nothing to Trump, of course. He only sees two tough guys, he considers himself tough and hopes they will pass on his messages to more Russian tough guys.\n\nFundamentalist Salafist and Wahhabi preaching is considered extremism by Russian authorities and the Kremlin has taken repressive measures over the past decade, but that has not stopped Putin from cozying up to athletes.\n\nShortly after Nurmagomedov's controversial victory over McGregor, Putin invited the No. 1 ranked fighter to meet him and supported his riot-inducing bad behavior. If we are attacked from the outside, we can all jump like this, he explained. The two men embraced, much like Trump did this month, posing for photos side by side with their hands clasped.\n\nPutin personally called Khabib in 2020 after his father died, allegedly from COVID-19, at the age of 57. Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov had trained Khabib since childhood, including having him wrestle a bear cub from the age of 9 in remarkable footage that has since disappeared. viral online. His father, a Russian army veteran who raised his son in the mountainous forests of the Caucasus, later groomed Makhachev to become his son's successor.\n\nPutin has long cultivated the habit of associating with young tough guys in order to bolster his own macho image, and Trump has clearly taken up the classic strongman trope.\n\nSince meeting Nurmagomedov, Trump has been full of praise, describing him on Truth Social as possibly the greatest fighter of all time. I met him at the UFC event Saturday night in New Jersey. Really smart guy - Big things in the future for Khabib!\n\nHe returned to the subject last week on the Logan Pauls podcast. I thought he was great. We need to talk, he's just my favorite guy. Really talented.\n\nGrigory Shvedov, editor-in-chief of Russia-based Caucasus Knot, says Khabib is very influential and a thought leader. He explained that the Kremlin pays great attention to people like Makhachev and Nurmagomedov so that they do not have any critical attitude towards the authorities. The KGB has always ensured close and controlling relations with all Russian athletes who reach the international level and it is certain that the FSB is now doing the same with the current generation of global sports stars. It's unclear whether that relationship would extend to asking them to deliver messages to people like Trump.\n\nDagestan's icons are also close to the famous warlord who rules the neighboring Russian republic and Chechnya. Ramzan Kadyrov, also known as Putin's Soldier, is the most violent and brutal leader in the North Caucasus and has been accused of countless human rights violations, anti-LGBT purges and oppression of his people.\n\nKadyrov loves spending time with the fighters for photos at his marble palace in Grozny and has handed out gifts including a Mercedes S-Class.\n\nThe meeting took place at UFC 302, managed by Trump's friend Dana White. At a time when Russian athletes are banned from participating in the Paris Olympics, Makhachev headlined the June 2 event.\n\nLike Trump, White clearly does not view Putin as an enemy. He previously said Putin would be more than welcome at a UFC event in Moscow.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType":

And, of course, the Kremlin will do whatever it can to help him win.\n\nThe meeting in New Jersey between Trump and the UFC stars was labelled \"historic\" by the Russian media and it opens yet another potential backchannel between Trump and Putin. \"We are very proud that our heroes go to America, meet with the future President Trump and that he promises them to finish the war in Ukraine,\" Magomed, a former law enforcement official from Dagestan, told The Daily Beast. \"Putin must be very happy, he has fatherly feelings for Khabib.\"\n\nhttps://www.thedailybeast.com/kremlin-joy-as-trump-sucks-up-to-controversial-russian-tough-guys", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media_in_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mass media in Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_Makhachev", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam Makhachev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khabib_Nurmagomedov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khabib Nurmagomedov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "News agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagestan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dagestan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dagestan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Conferences", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669447", "eventUri": "eng-9669447", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

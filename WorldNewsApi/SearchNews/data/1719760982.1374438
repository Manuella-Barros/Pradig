{"id": 225035626, "title": "Magic in a bottle' serum loved by Molly-Mae Hague now \u00a310 cheaper at Boots", "text": "Former Love Island star Molly-Mae Hague is quite the skincare aficionado, having revealed her elaborate eight-step night-time routine to her YouTube followers last year. The reality TV alum utilises a mix of high-end products from renowned brands such as Elemis, Nip and Fab, and Estee Lauder, with her comprehensive evening regimen said to total an eye-watering \u00a3361.30. However, one of her go-to items is enjoying a discount at Boots. The much-lauded Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Serum Synchronized Multi-Recovery Complex, typically retailing at \u00a365 for a 30ml bottle, is currently available with a \u00a310 saving. Now priced at \u00a355, this serum works overnight to hydrate, plump and restore your skin. This revered serum, packed with hyaluronic acid for optimum moisture retention and featuring the unique Chronolux Power Signal Technology to boost skin's natural repair cycle, has garnered over 15,000 five-star reviews, reports the Mirror. Customers rave about its 'miraculous' effects, with one satisfied user proclaiming: \"Been using this since I was 30 years old. I am 40 now and no one can believe I'm 40! They always guess early 20s.\" Another loyal fan commented: \"Used and loved this for many years now and definitely takes credit for my skin staying so fresh and youthful. 100% recommend to anyone considering purchasing!\" Join the Daily Record's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages. A third beauty buff praised: \"This is one of my holy grail products. I love using this, I swear it feels like I'm at a spa! The product smells so good, and when I wake up in the morning my skin looks and feels so fresh and plump, and super hydrated.\" Another added: \"I've seen such a difference in the appearance of my acne scars since using this product. I'm obsessed.\" Despite plenty of glowing reviews, some shoppers were left feeling disappointed after seeing little to no results. One customer added: \"It's a nice serum, but I didn't feel it did anything incredible to my skin to warrant adding it to my skincare routine. It also has a fragrance which I tend to try to avoid when it comes to skincare. However, I didn't notice any skin sensitivity due to the fragrance.\" Another negative which could put people off is the high price point, which is why we've added an alternative below. For fans wanting similar results there is the L'Oreal Paris' Midnight Age Perfect Night Serum. The lightweight, non-sticky textured night serum melts into the skin, dispersing an intense dose of moisture to plump and hydrate for hours. Right now it is priced at \u00a321.43 down from \u00a331.99 at Lookfantastic, this serum protects your skin from damaging aggressors during the day.

This is a comic actress who is particularly good playing people who are trying to get away with something, whose manner suggests one thing but whose eyes tell us something else. Here she gets to play that situation in virtually every scene -- to comic effect, mostly, but with moments of drama seeping in, as well.\n\nThis is an assured first feature film from director and co-writer Matt Spicer, who is 33 and thus young enough to understand the social media bubble that his lead character inhabits. At the start of the film, Ingrid (Plaza) is boiling over with rage, as she sits in a car and looks at a friend's Instagram entries. We soon realize that she is parked outside the wedding of that friend. Ingrid gets out, marches up to the bride, who is horrified to see her, and sprays her with mace.\n\nIngrid is an Internet stalker. She develops obsessions for people that she sees online and tries to insinuate herself into their world. Following a stint in a mental institution, she discovers a new woman-crush while thumbing through a magazine -- Taylor Sloane (Elizabeth Olsen), whose career consists of getting free products and services and then boosting them online. This is hardly a glamour job -- it's barely a job at all -- but Taylor has almost 300,000 Instagram followers, and so Ingrid idolizes her.\n\nIngrid becomes so obsessed that she takes a modest inheritance from her mother and uses it to move to Los Angeles, where Taylor lives. How Ingrid contrives to meet and befriend Taylor becomes the story of the movie.\n\nTo the filmmakers' credit, the characters are individual enough to provoke a complex response that is in no way ambiguous. Taylor is confident and enviable, and yet in some ways she is as much a poseur as Ingrid. Ingrid is a creep and a disease of the Internet, but we see the movie through her eyes and recognize the purity of her need for acceptance. \"Inside Goes West\" plays at the edges of being a thriller, but its ambition is really to be a character study, and along that line it's a fairly rich one.\n\nPlaza is fascinating here, a bottomless well of insecurity that approaches even the most casual social encounter as though there were a trapdoor under her feet and ready to drop. She makes it all funny, of course, but she stays real in the feeling of it, so that she isn't commenting on people like Ingrid but embodying Ingrid's pain. This makes her sympathetic and funny, as well as unsettling and strange.\n\nSuch a performance is not just about acting, but direction, and it can be said that all the performances here are in service of a specific vision. This includes O'Shea Jackson Jr. and Billy Magnussen, who are especially right in their supporting roles, as Ingrid's easy-going boyfriend and Taylor's vicious brother, respectively. Spicer knows exactly what he wants in this, and as the movie plays on, we realize that what he wants is worth achieving. He takes \"Ingrid Goes West\" to unexpected places that, in the end, not only feel right, but true. Uncomfortably true.\n\nFor this reason -- for all these reasons -- though I can't and shouldn't make the case that \"Ingrid Goes West\" is a great movie, it's a film that I loved, a highlight of my movie year.\n\nComedy-drama.

We quickly learn that Ingrid is parked outside that wedding, and instead of the usual eye-roll reactions to the photos most of us might have (and, incidentally, most of Aubrey Plaza's previous characters would have had), Ingrid barges into the reception and maces the bride in the face.\n\nThis stunt lands Ingrid a stint in a mental hospital, and once she's out, it's clear she hasn't exactly been cured. Living on a diet of junk food, in an empty house where the death of her mother still lingers in the dusty air, Ingrid continues to obsessively scroll through Instagram, hoping for Instafriendship by leaving comments like \"Damn girl, that looks amazing! What's your email address?\" on stranger's posts.\n\nEventually she finds the perfect object for her obsessions, an Instagram \"influencer\" named Taylor Sloane (Elizabeth Olsen) whose @_welltaylored_ account documents her meticulously styled Southern California lifestyle. Ingrid decides to pack the inheritance her mother left her into a backpack and heads west.\n\nSocial media makes it easy for Ingrid to stalk Taylor and find out where she gets her hair done, where she shops, where she eats her avocado toast, and where she lives. Thanks to that backpack full of money, Ingrid is able to remake herself in Taylor's image, including renting an apartment in nearby Venice, and through a dog-napping stunt actually befriends her.\n\nPlaza plays against her usual deadpan and sarcastic character type, replacing it with awkwardness and dorky obsession, and it's a welcome change. But what does remain, and I'm not sure Plaza will ever be able to shake this off, is the sense of danger that always seems to be lingering behind her huge eyes. And that works perfectly for Ingrid.\n\nIngrid Goes West is a comedic thriller that brings to mind similarly obsessed tales like Single White Female, The King of Comedy, and especially Robert Altman's 3 Women, whenever the setting moves to the Southern California desert and Taylor's second home in Joshua Tree. Olsen's Taylor is the quintessential Coachella chick, all gauzy tops and slouchy hats, \"slumming\" it at Pappy and Harriet's for the photo ops. Her image is a tightly controlled vision of easiness, and in reality is just as fake and manufactured as Ingrid's.\n\nThe film also features some great performances from the men in the women's lives, including Wyatt Russell as Ezra, Taylor's top-knotted husband, an aspiring artist who paints catchphrases over thrift store paintings (Ingrid is his first and only customer); O'Shea Jackson Jr, who steals almost every scene he's in as Ingrid's pot-selling, Batman-obsessed, aspiring screenwriter landlord and love interest; and Billy Magnussen as Taylor's coked-out, Hollywood leech brother Nicky, who quickly sees through Ingrid.\n\nDirector Matt Spicer and his co-screenwriter David Branson Smith aren't really telling a new story here; movies about obsession are as old as the medium itself.

While Ezra works on his \"found objects\" art (Ezra's pieces are so dreadful we want to advise him to cut off the man-bun and sell his hair for a few bucks, just so he can contribute to the partnership), Taylor continues to build her brand as a lifestyle guru.\n\nHere's the thing, though. As you might have surmised from the title, \"Ingrid Goes West\" isn't primarily about Taylor -- it's told mostly from the point of view of Aubrey Plaza's Ingrid, an unbalanced and lost Pennsylvanian in her 20s who suffers great humiliation in her hometown and latches onto an Internet obsession with Taylor (who makes the mistake of responding to one of Ingrid's Insta comments) as a way of making a comeback.\n\nStaked with a cash windfall she received from a personal tragedy, Ingrid sets off for California with the singular goal of meeting and befriending Taylor, and thanks to some basic Internet research skills and Ingrid's willingness to commit crimes and misdemeanors in the name of \"accidentally\" meeting Taylor, it doesn't take long for Ingrid and Taylor to become besties.\n\n(And why not? Yes, Ingrid is an Internet stalker -- but Taylor doesn't know that. Besides, Taylor herself is Fake News. Little wonder she'd gravitate to someone like Ingrid, who does nothing but praise her and validate her life.)\n\nI loved Ingrid's relationship with her landlord Dan (O'Shea Jackson Jr.), who is at least as delusional as Ingrid, given his wildly unsubstantiated belief he's writing the next \"Batman\" movie.\n\nBut for all of Dan's goofiness, at least he's a real human being who will be there for Ingrid when she needs him.\n\nAubrey Plaza is a sensation as Ingrid, who is alternately charming and sad and pathetic and absolutely insane. Plaza has a unique and magnetic screen presence that creates great empathy, even when she's portraying a mostly off-putting character.\n\nDirector and co-writer Matt Spicer displays just the right touch as the story gets crazier. We never lose sight of Ingrid's stalker ways and her unbalanced state -- but Taylor and Ezra and Taylor's brother Nicky (Billy Magnussen) and their so-called friends are such vapid, self-obsessed, social media vampires, we stay on Ingrid's side.\n\nBecause at least Ingrid has a soul.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u26051/2\n\nNeon presents a film directed by Matt Spicer and written by Spicer and David Branson Smith.

The premise is fairly simple: Ingrid Thorburn (Plaza), onetime denizen of a psychiatric ward, becomes obsessed with pretty LA blonde Taylor Sloane (Elizabeth Olsen), an Instagram starlet. Ingrid manages to move to Venice Beach and to insinuate herself into Taylor's life through a combination of stalking and strategic purchases (health foods, aspirational purses, hairdos). But the movie is not only about hating oneself and coveting other people's selves, although Ingrid undoubtedly wishes she could chew and swallow every last piece of her IG crush's life. It's also a gleefully vicious critique of those coveted lives themselves.\n\nTaylor Sloane is to-the-bone LA. She loves avocados and Joshua Tree, which she calls \"J Tree.\" Her hair is long and falls in loose white-lady waves. She wears white cotton and those ridiculous hats that only style bloggers and Williamsburg residents from 2009 sport. She fetishizes the craft traditions of the American Southwest, the kind sold for thousands of dollars in boutiques. Her home is filled with cacti and a large bearded man. She's the film equivalent of an IG user like TheBalancedBlonde or any number of other banal wellness-peddlers.\n\nIn satirizing Taylor Sloane's pretty, empty, commercial life, Ingrid Goes West points a finger at the proximity of silicon valley and venture capitalism to domestic aesthetics. Taylor calls herself \"a photographer,\" but she swaps IG posts for money from brands, which is not the same thing. Her husband, the bearded Ezra, hates her social media practice but the movie strongly implies that he resents her power and success more than he actually wishes for a more authentic life. He makes terrible art superimposing phrases like SQUAD GOALS over paintings of horses.\n\nInstagram is owned by Facebook, and both companies trade in the currency of normal people's images and information. In exchange for knowing everything about us and monetizing our friendships, Facebook builds a shadowy and superpowerful corporate empire that may well propel its founder into the White House one day. So, Ingrid Goes West portrays Taylor Sloane as a narcissistic and shallow young woman whose life is filled with low-grade human connections. But it also points out that \"Instagram Influencer\" is not a novel form. It's that classic thing, the Sell Out.\n\nAs a youngish woman who uses social media, it is impossible for me to avoid \"sponcon,\" a genre of post in which users with a large enough following, or \"influence,\" are paid to post advertisements in their feeds. An Instagram user might post a picture of herself in a cute outfit by a particular fashion line, or pose in a bikini with a mug of laxative tea held next to her abs. On the one hand, there's nothing very new about endorsement deals. Celebrities have always advertised products. I particularly love instances of outright contradiction, as when Naomi Campbell advertised Blackglama fur coats rather soon after posing for PETA's \"I'd rather go naked than wear fur\" campaign.\n\nBut there's something so abject about social media shills. A few weeks ago on Twitter, I came across this Macy's ad for shorts. This lady, a YouTuber named Sierra Furtado, wears the shorts and poses in front of a bicycle. She seems perfectly nice, and I suppose it's good that she doesn't have to share her paycheck with an agent or any of the other traditional intermediaries in advertising. But the fact that she is the brand, not Macy's, is totally bizarre. Her look is as flattened and generic as any ad on the side of a bus, but she somehow also has to maintain the illusion that this is her authentic life. The whole thing feels recursive and dizzying. I think the ad sucks and I don't want the shorts.\n\nI don't want the shorts, because being Sierra Furtado seems depressing. Being Taylor Sloane in Ingrid Goes West seems depressing. Being anybody who takes money to show images to their hundreds of thousands of Instagram followers seems depressing. Your life consists of voluntary participation in an advertising economy that exists to make money and . . . what else? I can't figure it out.\n\nEvery time I see somebody posing with some figs with a look on their face that suggests they are taking their power to influence people seriously, I'm so embarrassed I want to die. And I felt that embarrassment again in the cinema while watching Ingrid Goes West, because all its best jokes are either making fun of Taylor or over the burning, wretched shame of Ingrid.\n\nThe final twist in Ingrid Goes West's plot elevates the movie from near-sappy morality tale about Learning to Love the Real You into very dark territory indeed. I won't spoil the ending, but Ingrid learns that she can get attention in ways other than eating avocados and looking hot. The movie cries out for a sequel.\n\nPlaza is an excellent comic actress, and as her blank-eyed and disingenuous foil, Elizabeth Olsen does just fine. Newcomer O'Shea Jackson Jr. (Straight Outta Compton) deserves praise as Plaza's weed and Batman-obsessed love interest; his goofy charm supports Plaza's deathstare sociopathy and prevents her having to carry the movie alone. The movie also contains some excellently precise jokes: Taylor just loves Joan Didion, so Ingrid does too. Late in the movie, we see Ingrid desperately plunging her toilet after using pages from The White Album as toilet paper. Ingrid Goes West is an excruciating cinema experience, because embarrassment is the name of the Instagram influencer game. Like all great movie comedies, it hurts, but it's true.", "id": "9548812", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Against Instagram", "image":

This is something you might think about if you're watching Ingrid Goes West [2017] -- the movie sets itself up like a satire, but its main subject is the culture of social media, and it depicts that realistically, if only because online culture is already silly enough as is. In the movie, Aubrey Plaza features as an unstable loner who manipulates her way into the life of a popular Instagram user (Elizabeth Olsen), even resorting to violence to keep up her cool-girl charade -- the joke being that Plaza's character therefore goes from being a digital \"follower\" to a literal one, making this something like Single White Female With an iPhone. That's a connection that writer/director Matt Spicer chooses to lean into: Single White Female [1992] is cited directly, while another shot quotes Halloween [1979]. So the satire of the film, in theory, comes from this contrast -- from the fact that a seemingly innocuous habit (social media usage) is being grafted onto an entirely sinister format (the structure of thrillers and slasher movies). But when it comes to depicting Instagram posts, the movie achieves something more like recognition than exaggeration. Spicer does have the performers read their character's posts aloud, word by word, via narration -- so you'll hear Olsen, in character, exclaiming something like \"New Clare V. clutch got me like dot dot dot princess emoji.\" But that cheeky line reading doesn't change the fact that you really do see that kind of post -- written in that kind of vernacular -- whenever you check your own feed. That element of Ingrid doesn't feel like satire at all. Its depiction of social media isn't quite exaggerated -- if anything, it's closer to uncanny.\n\nBut a filmmaker doesn't have an actress saying \"dot dot dot princess emoji\" unless he thinks the character posting that phrase is a little bit vapid. So on the subject of social media, you know where Ingrid Goes West stands, and you know it from the start. In fact, the first 10 minutes of the movie lay out its entire agenda. An opening montage shows off the Instagram feed of a woman named Charlotte, who is mostly documenting her upcoming nuptials (\"so glad I married this weirdo, fluttering hearts emoji\"); the next scene depicts Ingrid (Plaza) at the wedding, uninvited, where she maces the bride (she does so as payback for a perceived snub -- Charlotte had once commented on her Instagram posts, so Ingrid had expected an invite). This lands Ingrid in a mental health facility, where she appears to legitimately stabilize -- or, at least, she claims as much -- before she's finally released and given back her possessions, including her phone, thus starting the whole process over again. Spicer gives that phone a close-up as Ingrid reclaims it from a bag, as though it were a precious object finally unearthed. When she logs back online -- for what is the first time in a long time -- the score swells, and her eyes glaze over. This imagery is unmistakable. And just like with \"dot dot dot princess emoji,\" the conclusion suggested is a disapproving one: Ingrid is an addict, the phone is her fix.\n\nLike most fixes, it leaves her wanting more -- and the lives that look best on Instagram are what she covets most. To replace Charlotte, Ingrid finds Taylor Sloane (Olsen), who lives near Joshua Tree with her husband Ezra (Wyatt Russell). Spicer's film is thinking about the way that these two women represent opposite sides of the same experience -- the movie is as skeptical of Taylor's presentation of her life as it is of Ingrid's obsession with it. And its humor, so far as it has any, comes from the cheap shots it takes at the way their online personas contrast with their actual lives: In one sequence, Ingrid gazes lovingly at Taylor's gourmet lunch, which has been posted on Instagram; then Spicer's film cuts jarringly to the ugly frozen meal sitting on her own table. Later, when Ingrid has worked herself into the Sloane home, Taylor has to apologize that she has no food from the \"farmer's market,\" because her Instagram persona had suggested her kitchen would be fully stocked with such offerings. The joke, in both cases, is about the gulf between self-presentation and reality -- which is also to say that it's a tired joke, and one usually made with greater nuance, too. All this happens in the first third of the movie, and from these scenes alone, you can tell where the next two-thirds will go: The personal relationships formed among these characters will be fractured by what they do with their phones, because that's how pseudo-satires about social issues tend to play out. All the while, Spicer keeps his frames detached from any individual perspective, often blocking his actors within deliberately flat compositions, so you're not really seeing this from either woman's point of view. Aesthetically and otherwise, it's more like you're looking down at both of them.\n\nThen why see it, why think about it, why read about it? What keeps you invested in the movie -- or, at least, what keeps you watching it -- is the astuteness it has about the vernaculars we use online and about the phones we use to type them. This is a film that knows that a person may spend minutes deciding between \"ha ha\" and \"heh heh\" when messaging someone for the first time. This is a film that knows that people currently feel no shame about demanding that service workers take their photo just so they can post it via social media. And this is a film that knows that a sheltered white girl, after meeting the African-American man who lives next door (O'Shea Jackson Jr.), might express shock upon finding out he's a landlord. Those last two examples are intertwined with class dynamics, which is the one subject the film is actually savvy about. After watching Ingrid connect herself to Taylor and Ezra, the screenplay continues to add characters to their social circle -- like Taylor's ex-con brother, who's the only one cynical enough to see through Ingrid's machinations, or his fashion-designer girlfriend, who becomes an aspirational figure for Taylor just as Taylor is for Ingrid -- and each person it adds expands those dynamics significantly. For Taylor, for instance, Ingrid's unchecked adoration is much welcomed -- but not when it's happening in the vicinity of the fashion designer, whom Taylor adores herself, meaning that Ingrid's BFF-style dedication suddenly has the stink of lower-class desperation.\n\nIronically enough it's those dramatic moments -- when Instagram is left behind, satire is off the table, and the characters are face to face -- where the film's insights are heaviest. But Ingrid spends most of its time elsewhere, jabbing weakly at a much easier target -- the hallmarks and cliches of social media -- casting aspersions toward the way 20-somethings will post the covers of books they haven't read, toward the kids who post inspirational one-liners as if they were profundities, or toward the people that comment on serious family tragedies with posts like \"#blue.\" From the way Spicer's actors read those posts aloud, you know that it's all coming from a place of condescension, even when there's empathy mixed in. So despite all the film's qualities, it becomes just as basic as the people it mocks -- because who needs to go to the movies to feel superior to a typical Instagram post? We don't even need to leave the house for that. We just need to pick up our phones.", "id": "9809643", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "NO EXAGGERATION: INGRID GOES WEST SHOWS THAT EVEN SATIRE HAS ITS LIMITS", "image": "https://digboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ingrid-goes-728.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "id": "302545", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Actor"}, "id": "302943", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Instagram"}, "id": "303287", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram"}, {"label": {"eng": "Culture"}, "id": "303325", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}, {"label": {"eng": "African American"}, "id": "304393", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"}, {"label": {"eng": "IPhone"}, "id": "306005", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fashion"}, "id": "308069", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion"}, {"label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}, "id": "309129", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking"}, {"label": {"eng": "Emoji"}, "id": "309729", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji"}, {"label": {"eng": "Satire"}, "id": "311317", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aubrey Plaza"}, "id": "333850", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_Plaza"}, {"label": {"eng": "Slasher film"}, "id": "388367", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slasher_film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Olsen"}, "id": "393755", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Olsen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Single White Female"}, "id": "565084", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_White_Female"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wyatt Russell"}, "id": "608878", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyatt_Russell"}, {"label": {"eng": "O'Shea Jackson, Jr."}, "id": "1352418", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Shea_Jackson,_Jr."}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 573, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 577, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 761, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations"}], "time": "02:18:00"}

But it's true, everywhere you look, there's something that reminds you of our film,\" said Plaza.\n\nWhen she says \"our film,\" there's a special pride of ownership.\n\nNot only is Plaza earning praise for a challenging role -- \"Nobody plays ambivalence better, but she allows herself to be vulnerable here\" Variety wrote - she produced the movie, in theaters Aug. 25, that is part of a purposeful evolution that has seen the onetime slacker figure take charge of her career in a very un-slacker way.\n\nThough Plaza, now 33, often plays the role of a flake in public appearances, that drive has been there all along.\n\n\"It's never good enough,\" said Matt Spicer, who directed Ingrid. \"As director, you're like, 'Aubrey, we got it.' But her response is always, 'No, please one more!' And you don't want to say no, because often the next take is even better.\"\n\nHer work ethic has taken her from supporting player (Parks and Recreation) to offbeat ing\u00e9nue lead (Life After Beth, Safety Not Guaranteed), and now she's finding and developing good roles for herself. It's increasingly a dominant model in Hollywood. Women aren't waiting for the right role. They're making it happen.\n\n\"There are so many more opportunities, so many platforms and television channels, you can find a lot of interesting work, and women are definitely stepping up,\" Plaza said.\n\nShe's one of them. Plaza produced The Little Hours, released this summer, and found the experience transformative.\n\n\"It really opened my eyes to how impactful a producer is on the end product. And I always knew it was something I wanted to do more of -- I went to film school [NYU], and have always been interested in the entire process.\"\n\nThat intensified when she read Spicer's script for Ingrid -- the story of a mentally unstable young woman who moves to L.A. to indulge her obsessive interest in an Instagram star, played by Elizabeth Olsen. Plaza saw larger implications in the story. While Ingrid's obsession is particular to the character, it will be familiar to a generation raised on social media -- Plaza counts herself among them.\n\n\"We all have impulses like Ingrid. Sometimes we allow ourselves to get kind of lost in social media, to really go down that rabbit hole. I think it's a very common experience. And that was part of the story -- we wanted Ingrid to feel relatable. Even though she's behaving badly and doing lots of questionable things, you want to root for her,\" Plaza said.\n\nOf course, the worse things go for Ingrid, the better the role becomes for Plaza, who has a chance to show more range, moving from comedy to extreme and authentic emotional distress. \"I just couldn't believe someone had written a role like this, it was so good, and something I felt I could really do well,\" she said. \"And as I'm reading it, I'm really seeing the whole bigger vision of what the movie could be.\"\n\nAnd Plaza had an in -- she knew the guy who wrote it. Spicer, raised in Hatboro, was already an acquaintance in Hollywood.\n\n\"I honestly think there is a special familiarity that comes from being from near Philly. We're kind of the same age. We both grew up outside the city, we both grew up loving movies, we both went to film school, we really hit if off,\" she said.\n\nSpicer said it helped having all these reference points in common, especially when it came to how they saw their fractured heroine. \"I think Ingrid definitely has a personality disorder of some kind. She has that going on, and when she is confronted with social media, and has a device in her hands, it absolutely intensified her worst instincts.\"\n\nSpicer put it this way: \"It's like giving a baby a gun. It's just the wrong tool for the wrong individual.\"\n\nPlaza talked about an article she'd just read in The Atlantic linking increased usage of social media with a decline in overall happiness, even deteriorating mental health.\n\nShe sees that at work in Ingrid.\n\n\"Social media can be depressing and confusing. It almost encourages delusional thinking, because often times what's going on there is not real. For someone like Ingrid, that's even more of a problem.\"\n\nWhat's real for Plaza is her busy career -- ongoing work on FX's Legion, a starring lead opposite Jemaine Clement in the forthcoming comedy An Evening with Beverly Luff Linn.\n\nAnd, who knows, maybe a stint behind the camera.\n\n\"Usually, an actor is focused on their individual contribution to the film. But from the first meeting, she was asking really smart questions about the entire production. Other characters that had nothing to do with Ingrid,\" Spicer said. \"How are you going to shoot it? What lens are you going to use? These are not normal actor questions. These are filmmaker questions. It wouldn't surprise me at all if she ends up directing.\"\n\nEspecially now that she's fulfilled a career ambition -- to play (or at least cosplay) Catwoman -- thanks to one of the funnier scenes in Ingrid, opposite Straight Outta Compton's O'Shea Jackson Jr.\n\n\"That's right, yes,\" said Plaza, finally surrendering to her inner imp. \"I always wanted to be Michelle Pfeiffer. To crawl up on Michael Keaton, and lick his face.\"\n\nRead more by Gary Thompson Published: August 18, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 3:01 AM EDT Thanks for your continued support...\n\nWe recently asked you to support our journalism.

We shot in Beverly, for example, where I'd never been. I loved it and found it very beautiful. The same goes for the Loyola [University] campus up in Rogers Park. It's so lovely by the water.

It has such a magical vibe to it.\"\n\nIn her new film \"Ingrid Goes West\" (opening Friday), Plaza's Ingrid character becomes so obsessed with an Instagram star (played by Elizabeth Olsen) that she moves to Los Angeles and finds a way to befriend the woman, using a sudden inheritance to finance her twisted plan.\n\n\"Obviously, California is the perfect setting for a seemingly perfect woman, with the perfect figure, gorgeous, perfect boyfriend and seemingly perfect life -- that seems right out of a lifestyle magazine -- for Ingrid to obsess over,\" said Plaza. \"But I'm sure there have been similar situations in Chicago or Miami or New York where something like this could occur.\"\n\nTo prepare to play their parts in \"Ingrid,\" both Plaza and Olsen did \"allow ourselves to indulge in social media quite a bit, more than we ever would do in our real lives,\" said Plaza. \"We spent a lot of time on Instagram and Facebook and tried to behave -- somewhat -- like these characters.\"\n\nThe actress came to relate to the fascination with others -- living vicariously through their vacation photos and the like. \"I'd look at people's pictures of their vacation in Ibiza and think, 'I'm never doing anything as cool as that! Why am I sitting in my room, just looking at the wall!'\n\n\"But then you find out -- if it's someone you actually know for real -- that that Instagram photo of them smiling is the only one.

Or gone down a spiral of late night scrolling that starts out as voyeurism and ends in despair? That's the sensation captured in \"Ingrid Goes West,\" an indie film (opening Aug. 18) that skewers both sides of the social media equation.\n\nIt's the latest pop-culture satire to delve into the ways social media impacts our personal lives. That same idea was explored in the \"Nosedive\" episode of the Netflix series \"Black Mirror,\" which imagines a society in which class and opportunity are based on social-media popularity and in which strangers and friends alike can impact anyone's rating, based on just a single interaction.\n\n\"Ingrid Goes West\" comes close enough to reality to make us squirm. On one end, there's Ingrid (played by Aubrey Plaza), who's outraged watching a wedding on social media that she wasn't invited to attend. An obsessive, she upends her life, moves to Los Angeles and reinvents herself in the image of a stranger she has become enchanted with on Instagram.\n\nThat woman, Taylor Sloane (Elizabeth Olsen), posts a perfect Instagram photo of the perfect vintage copy of Joan Didion's \"The White Album\" with the perfect quote and a jumble of hashtags like #blessed and #inspiration. Her account is filled with her Moon Juice smoothies and Erdem dresses and Clare V clutches and succulents and California sunsets and trips to Joshua Tree.\n\nFollowers never see her doing such mundane things as getting the oil changed in her unwashed car, paying bills or cleaning the toilet.\n\nMaybe she's a friend, or a friend of a friend or possibly someone follow even though they don't actually know her. But that's not creepy, because she has hundreds of thousands of followers. She's an Influencer -- somewhere on the spectrum between celebrity and not quite ordinary. Her life is her brand, and her followers are envious admirers, devoted subjects and customers.\n\nWhen Matt Spicer, the film's director and co-writer, was developing his idea for \"Ingrid Goes West,\" the \"Black Mirror\" episode had not yet been released. Spicer says he had seen too few media examinations of the \"love/hate\" relationship he has with social media, and his co-writer, David Branson Smith, agreed.\n\nBoth were in relationships with women who had significant internet followings. Both understood the searing jealousy that can boil over while looking at the filtered lives of others.\n\nThe film Spicer and Smith created, \"really captured how people interact right now and the problems with that,\" says Plaza, who also served as a producer on the film. \"And I ... liked the story of a girl who really wants another girl to be her friend, and to like her.\"\n\nPlaza and Olsen approached their characters without judgment. Both, in essence, just want to be liked and to fit in, though Ingrid takes some dark, probably questionable turns in her pursuit of that goal.\n\nThe filmmakers stopped short of assigning a mental illness to Ingrid's obsession. \"We wanted the audience to see parts of themselves in (Ingrid),\" Spicer says. \"We didn't want them to write her off.\"\n\nAs celebrities, the actresses have a different relationship with social media than most of the rest of us.\n\n\"It's really confusing sometimes,\" says Plaza. \"It can be a really great tool, as an actor and a public figure. But then the flip side is that it can sometimes be really invasive and it's hard to navigate. It's too much access and too much awareness. It's hard to find a balance.\"\n\nIn fact, Olsen was initially a social-media detractor. She joined some sites only because of the role she would be playing in this film. Now she has 668,000 Instagram followers.\n\nShe says, \"Honestly I have less of a judgment against it because of this movie. I think I'm starting to figure out that there is a way to poke fun at it, but also use it to your benefit.\"\n\n\"Ingrid\" scratches the surface of something the social sciences are analyzing, too.\n\nOne study from the Center for Research on Media, Technology and Health at the University of Pittsburgh has indicated heavy use of platforms like Facebook and Instagram among adults ages 19 to 32 is associated with feelings of social isolation.\n\nAnother study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that overall, \"The use of Facebook was negatively associated with well-being.\"\n\nBut Karen North, a psychologist and director of the University of Southern California's Digital Social Media Program cautions against taking as gospel headlines that project conclusions on such correlations.\n\n\"There are things that we've known for decades about human behavior and social dynamics,\" North says. \"Those will not change, but now it's mediated by digital devices. It's easier to find like-minded people, but at the same time (the digital world) accentuates problems of human interaction.\"\n\nLast year \"Black Mirror\" creator Charlie Brooker told the Associated Press, \"Usually the technology isn't to blame in the stories. It's just facilitating some weakness in our character.\"\n\nThough films about technology often have a shorter shelf life than a carton of milk, \"Ingrid Goes West\" seems especially pertinent at the moment.\n\nSpicer says, \"We shot it and made it so quickly that it does feel still somewhat relevant.\"\n\nIt might make viewers think twice about snapping an Instagram of their avocado toast, no matter how many likes that might get them.", "id": "9721441", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Movies: Director Matt Spicer's 'Ingrid Goes West' satirizes social-media envy", "image":

In it, Aubrey Plaza plays Ingrid Thorburn, a troubled young woman from a flyover state whose ultimate fulfillment comes from social media. With her mother recently deceased and her \"best friend\" (an almost complete stranger whom she stalks on Instagram) committing the ultimate offence by not inviting her to her wedding, Ingrid finds herself committed to an institution. Upon her release, she takes the entirety of her inheritance to move to Los Angeles and strike up a friendship with her newest obsession, Instagram star and \"influencer\" Taylor Sloane (Elizabeth Olsen).\n\nIngrid manages to fake her way into a friendship with Taylor simply by picking up on the stuff she likes (the stuff she thinks is \"just the best,\" in her parlance) and building a perfect BFF personality. For Ingrid, the friendship is a life preserver - but for Taylor, it's yet another disposable way to grow her brand, a life goal that's also driving a wedge between her and her husband (Wyatt Russell), who quit his job at her insistence to become an artist (a painter who stencils hashtags over corny thrift-store paintings).\n\nDirector and co-writer Matt Spicer finds himself in the peculiar position of having to make a film skewering a culture that is not only widespread throughout the world, but also woven into the very fabric of life in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I've lived in Los Angeles for almost 15 years now,\" says Spicer. \"Living there, I think you do encounter a lot of this stuff. Dave and I, when we were writing this script, it was the specificity of it that made us laugh and made it relatable. Making fun of L.A. is kind of like making fun of your family: you still love them, but you can't help make fun of each other. I definitely make fun of myself as much as I make fun of other people - I eat avocado toast, y'know? Dave and I are definitely making fun of ourselves as well.\"\n\nThis idea also extends to the film's stars. As young, popular actresses, they themselves have an inevitable relationship with social media and fandom that's difficult to ignore. (Interestingly, three of the film's stars grew up in show-business families - that also includes Ice Cube's son O'Shea Jackson Jr., who plays Ingrid's Batman-loving landlord and love interest.)\n\n\"Lizzie grew up in L.A., so I think she has a perspective on all that stuff that I share with her and that we would talk about when we first met,\" says Spicer. \"And Aubrey... you know, both of them being in the public eye, they both have a complicated relationship with social media. (...) I'm sure that that factored into it as well. I guess for the most part, what really drew them to it was the part, but hearing them talk I think that the stuff that the film was exploring was stuff that was on their minds as well.\"\n\nIngrid Goes West gets pretty dark at times; Spicer is unafraid to show some fucked up stuff both psychologically and physically in a way that isn't seen too often in films that are ostensibly comedies. Actions have consequences in Ingrid Goes West.\n\n\"Part of that is just my taste, you know, the kinds of movies that I like to watch,\" says Spicer. \"I like the Coen Brothers - movies where there's people getting murdered but there's still jokes, you know? They manage to do it in a way where... take the woodchipper scene from Fargo. It's shocking and it's funny in a way that really works. So, yes, part of it is just my personal taste, but another part of it is wanting to show the dark side of social media and what someone could possibly be driven to do if they didn't have the boundaries that the rest of us have. That was part of it too - not wanting to shy away from that.\"\n\nIngrid Goes West finds itself in a similar position to a film like Jason Reitman's Young Adult, a character study about a person who is incredibly difficult to like. That's by design, according to Spicer.\n\n\"I always think the word likeable is kind of overrated,\" says Spicer. \"Likeable characters are kind of boring! I think it's more interesting to watch someone who isn't! Young Adult is a great example because we all kinda know someone like that. I'm really interested in stripping away the layers and figuring out what makes them tick - what makes someone act like that. And to see that, really, deep down, we're all humans and we all have flaws and foibles and things that are driving us. I think it's good to watch stuff like that. I like being reminded of that humanity.\" \u25a0", "id": "9752819", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "To live and die on social media", "image": "http://cultmontreal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Ingrid-Aubrey-Plaza-and-Taylor-Elizabeth-Olsen-pose-for-a-photo-in-INGRID-GOES-WEST-courtesy-of-NEON.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "228323", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "id": "302545", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Business"}, "id": "302720", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Actor"}, "id": "302943", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Painting"}, "id": "303148", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painting"}, {"label": {"eng": "Instagram"}, "id": "303287", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram"}, {"label": {"eng": "Psychology"}, "id": "304392", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hashtag"}, "id": "305777", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag"}, {"label": {"eng": "Personal flotation device"}, "id": "311491", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_flotation_device"}, {"label": {"eng": "Avocado"}, "id": "318027", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avocado"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aubrey Plaza"}, "id": "333850", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_Plaza"}, {"label": {"eng": "Coen brothers"}, "id": "336128", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coen_brothers"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fandom"}, "id": "352071", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ice Cube"}, "id": "363458", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Cube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Olsen"}, "id": "393755", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Olsen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Woodchipper"}, "id": "455662", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodchipper"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fargo (film)"}, "id": "564194", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(film)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wyatt Russell"}, "id": "608878", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyatt_Russell"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hans Sloane"}, "id": "736210", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Sloane"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jason Reitman"}, "id": "789346", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Reitman"}, {"label": {"eng": "Young Adult (film)"}, "id": "954720", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Adult_(film)"}, {"label": {"eng": "O'Shea Jackson, Jr."}, "id": "1352418", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Shea_Jackson,_Jr."}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}], "time": "18:23:00"}

The dark comedy blends biting contemporary satire with fine-tuned character studies, showcasing insights of online behavior and the ability of social media to pull out the worst in people.\n\nAubrey Plaza plays the titular Ingrid, a lonely, unstable, Instagram-obsessed young woman who conflates likes and comments with real connection. When Ingrid is first introduced to the audience, she is crashing the wedding of a high-school classmate. A mace incident, restraining order and brief stint in a mental hospital later, Ingrid finds her new fixation: social media influencer Taylor Sloane (Elizabeth Olsen). A young, beautiful woman who constantly posts about her picture-perfect California life with her artist husband Ezra (Wyatt Russell), she's the kind of neo-hippie who is unironically #blessed whenever she scores a new vintage find.\n\nUsing the inheritance from her recently deceased mother, Ingrid travels to California to find and befriend Taylor. She rents an apartment from Dan (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) and, after executing more than a few morally dubious schemes, ingrains herself into Taylor's life.\n\nShe becomes predictably possessive when Taylor's obnoxious brother Nicky (Billy Magnussen) comes to town and immediately sees through Ingrid's fa\u00e7ade. After going through her phone, Nicky blackmails Ingrid, setting an inevitable dark third-act pivot into motion. While the ending takes some dark narrative turns that never fully hit, Spicer still manages to surprise viewers.\n\nSpicer's commentary is aimed at both those who curate their lives for the attention of others and those who believe that curation to be reality. The idea of projecting the perfect image has long been a large motivation for people's behavior, and the main commentary of the film is rooted in the studied vapidity of Taylor Sloane.\n\nAt first, Taylor seems to be the quintessential cool girl of her Instagram feed, but the more we learn about her, the less special she seems. Her impressive social media image gives way to the reality of her life, and we see that she is creating a fa\u00e7ade every bit as phony as Ingrid's. Spicer looks past the obvious criticisms of Instagram celebrities and instead pulls out the inauthenticity and loneliness that comes from living a life performed for online consumption.\n\nIt's evident that Spicer cares just as much about curating his characters as he does about his social commentary; the film is at its best when it focuses on its characters and the performances that bring them to life. Russell shines as the charming, possibly alcoholic hippie husband; Olsen nails the essence of a social media influencer without seeming gimmicky. Jackson Jr. steals every scene, giving a hilarious and charismatic performance as Ingrid's landlord Dan Pinto, a stoner screenwriter with an affinity for Batman.\n\nPlaza deftly balances unhinged comedy and vulnerability, but the film's third act struggles as Ingrid's desperation to be Taylor's best friend escalates into depravity. With a final scene that never fully resolves itself, the depth of Ingrid's psyche is never fully developed.", "id": "9717796", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "'Ingrid Goes West' satirizes dark side of social media obsession", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/www.dailycal.org/assets/uploads/2017/08/Ingrid-Goes-West_NEON.Courtesy.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "227084", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "id": "302545", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Television"}, "id": "302838", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"}, {"label": {"eng": "Comedy"}, "id": "302913", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Instagram"}, "id": "303287", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram"}, {"label": {"eng": "Curator"}, "id": "304634", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curator"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wedding"}, "id": "305401", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding"}, {"label": {"eng": "Celebrity"}, "id": "307719", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity"}, {"label": {"eng": "Satire"}, "id": "311317", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hippie"}, "id": "313909", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Black comedy"}, "id": "317958", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aubrey Plaza"}, "id": "333850", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_Plaza"}, {"label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Olsen"}, "id": "393755", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Olsen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Billy Magnussen"}, "id": "608877", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Magnussen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wyatt Russell"}, "id": "608878", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyatt_Russell"}, {"label": {"eng": "O'Shea Jackson, Jr."}, "id": "1352418", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Shea_Jackson,_Jr."}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 291, "label": "dmoz/News/Media", "uri": "dmoz/News/Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 292, "label": "dmoz/News/Media/Services", "uri": "dmoz/News/Media/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 297, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Psychology", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Psychology"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1071, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Social Work", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Social_Work"}], "time": "15:09:00"}

But in his feature debut, writer-director Matt Spicer has identified some basic problems without really finding a way to get past the obvious.\n\nAubrey Plaza is aptly cast as Ingrid Thorburn, a young Pennsylvanian who, in the film's thinly backgrounded setting, has spent too long caring for her invalid mother. Presumably, she never got properly socialized and, being a product of her times, turned to social media instead. When we meet her, she's attacking a bride in the midst of a wedding to which she wasn't invited. By the time she's sentenced to a mental hospital, we realize she only knew the victim through Instagram.\n\nMontage sequences show Ingrid getting better, through group therapy et cetera, but Spicer's script (written with David Branson Smith) isn't interested in what she learned, but only in how she can turn her smartphone sights on bigger game. The mousy easterner gets her chance when Mom dies, leaving enough cash for her to drop everything and fly to L.A. There, she stumbles onto Taylor Sloane (Elizabeth Olsen), a paid media \"influencer\" with a seemingly golden Venice Beach lifestyle. Ingrid soon finagles her way into Taylor's actual life, and that of the latter's wearily hipsterized husband, Ezra (the excellent Wyatt Russell, son of Kurt and Goldie).\n\nThis ingratiation is wittily staged, shot, and edited. (Interesting that the meta-clever score is by someone named Nick Thorburn.) And it has a standout performance by O'Shea Jackson Jr. (who played his own father, aka Ice Cube, in Straight Outta Compton) as a Batman-obsessed would-be screenwriter. He's also her new landlord and inexplicably smitten by her beyond-awkward ways.\n\nSpicer taps into the peculiarly tremulous vacuity at the centre of Olsen's still-undeveloped appeal, and if the movie had stuck to its Bridesmaids-for-millennials wackiness, it probably could have hit all its targets while remaining a fun ride. But he also goes for a Single White Female vibe -- referenced in the dialogue, along with other '90s touchstones -- and after introducing a rival sociopath in the form of Taylor's frat-hole brother (Billy Magnussen), the tale becomes increasingly mean-spirited, heading toward a finale that teaches all the wrong lessons about wanting to be \"liked\".", "id": "9582664", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "We can't quite \"like\" Ingrid Goes West", "image": "https://www.straight.com/files/v3/images/17/08/mov_ingridgoeswest2_2589.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "228323", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "229682", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice,_Los_Angeles", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "id": "302545", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "id": "302682", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Instagram"}, "id": "303287", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram"}, {"label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}, "id": "304250", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay"}, {"label": {"eng": "Screenwriter"}, "id": "304251", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenwriter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Generation Y"}, "id": "304390", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Y"}, {"label": {"eng": "Psychiatric hospital"}, "id": "324881", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aubrey Plaza"}, "id": "333850", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_Plaza"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ice Cube"}, "id": "363458", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Cube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bridesmaids (2011 film)"}, "id": "363468", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridesmaids_(2011_film)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Olsen"}, "id": "393755", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Olsen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Single White Female"}, "id": "565084", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_White_Female"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wyatt Russell"}, "id": "608878", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyatt_Russell"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nicholas Thorburn"}, "id": "1191366", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Thorburn"}, {"label": {"eng": "Straight Outta Compton (film)"}, "id": "1278217", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_Out_of_Compton_(film)"}, {"label": {"eng": "O'Shea Jackson, Jr."}, "id": "1352418", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Shea_Jackson,_Jr."}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 7, "label": "dmoz/Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Arts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 364, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 559, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 594, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1403, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Screenwriting", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Screenwriting"}], "time": "23:28:00"}
{"timeCrawl": "10:14:00", "uri": "711377482", "lang": "eng", "originalArticle": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-18T10:14:00Z", "sim": 0.5176470875740051, "source": {"title": "CTV News", "uri": "ctvnews.ca", "id": "30"}, "url": "http://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/movie-reviews-the-hitman-s-bodyguard-succeeds-due-to-chemistry-between-actors-1.3548872", "eventUri": "eng-3367406", "isDuplicate": false, "storyUri": "eng-3367406", "body": "Richard Crouse, Contributor, CTV News Channel and CTV News Digital\n\n\"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" mixes and matches all the usual action movie flourishes -- exotic locations, violence, jokes and romance -- but succeeds because of the match between its leads, Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nReynolds is Michael Bryce, former executive protection hot shot. He was a man who handled security for the world's richest and most dangerous people until one of his clients didn't make it home alive. Losing his AAA status affected him personally and professionally. \"I don't really do high-value anymore,\" he says. \"These days I'm more in the coked out attorney business.\"\n\nJackson is contract killer Darius Kincaid. With hundreds of notches on his belt, he is one of the world's most deadly killers but makes a deal with Interpol to testify at The Hague against a former Belorussian dictator (Gary Oldman) in exchange for the release of his wife Sonia (Salma Hayek) from a Dutch prison. Trouble is, there's a leak at Interpol and the transport, led by Interpol agent and Bryce's ex Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung), is attacked.\n\nKinciad and Roussel escape, but to sidestep any more leaks and get to The Hague they realize they must bring in someone, \"completely out of the loop.\" Enter Bryce, who takes the gig because he wants his elite status back. \"You're not good at anything except keeping people alive,\" says Roussel.\n\nCue the bullets, explosions and one-liners.\n\nThey say casting is everything and in the case of \"The Hitman's Bodyguard,\" it's hard to disagree. The story is a clich\u00e9nado, a swirling mish mash of countdown clocks, car crashes and a hitman with a conscience that feels like we've seen it before and better in other movies. Then there's a romantic subplot -- apparently, without love, all the killing and mayhem have no meaning -- that gets in the way of the fun stuff.\n\nWhat changes things up is some clever casting. Reynolds's crack-comic timing and Jackson's swagger are well-tested commodities that reap benefits here. Add to that Selma Hayek's foul mouthed but funny Sonia and Oldham's scowling dictator and you have an all-star cast that transforms the so-so material.\n\n\"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" is a silly but entertaining movie. It works when it shouldn't and just when your attention starts to wander it draws you back in. A philosophical twist -- Who is more wicked? He who kills evil m******f*****s or he who protects them? -- doesn't go anywhere but the final shot before the credits marries romance and ultra-violence in a way that made me forgive the film's previous transgressions.\n\nLUCKY LOGAN: 3 \u00bd STARS\n\nDirector Steven Soderbergh's biggest box office came courtesy of the glossy \"Ocean's Eleven\" series. His new film sees him revisit similar territory but don't expect a carbon copy of his biggest hits. \"Lucky Logan\" is a down-home \"Ocean's Eleven\" where some good old boys plan a robbery, but the slickness of the franchise films has been left in the vault.\n\nChanning Tatum is Jimmy Logan, former quarterback and homecoming king, whose glory days are in the rear-view mirror. Divorced but devoted to his daughter. He's now a West Virginia miner laid off from his job of filling in sinkholes at the Charlotte Motor Speedway, home of one of the biggest NASCAR races on the circuit.\n\nHis brother Clyde (Adam Driver), a bartender and Iraq War vet whose hand was blown off by an IED, chalks up the job loss to a family curse. The Unlucky Logans have a history of misfortune, one that Jimmy hopes to turn around.\n\nEnlisting his sister Mellie (Riley Keough) and the Bang Brothers, the bleach blonde Joe (Daniel Craig), Sam (Brian Gleeson) and Fish (Jack Quaid), he comes up with an elaborate plan to rob the vault at the Speedway on the busiest weekend of the year.\n\n\"Lucky Logan\" is a carefully plotted caper flick -- although some of the elements of the labyrinthine heist are a little too perfect, relying too much on movie coincidences to be believable -- but it's a loose film with an indie feel. The stars are big but this isn't a big film. Unlike the sleek \"Ocean's\" films, the style of \"Lucky Logan\" suits its subject. It feels like handmade, blue-collar filmmaking.\n\nSoderbergh's looseness trickles down to the actors. Tatum and Craig seem to be having the best time, as Driver amps up the sincerity as the younger brother so desperate to live up to big bro's legacy that he enlisted in the army. Once again (after \"American Honey) Keough proves she is a formidable actor and not just Elvis Presley's grandfather while \"Family Guy's\" Seth MacFarlane is suitably smarmy as the owner of a power drink company. Their combined efforts keeps things grounded even when as the caper grows more and more outrageous.\n\n\"Lucky Logan\" feels like a throwback to the 90s indie scene that made Soderbergh an in-demand filmmaker in the first place. From the Tarantino-esque script -- the pop culture references and \"Game of Thrones\" riffs -- to the eye level characters, it's a welcome return.\n\nINGRID GOES WEST: 4 STARS\n\nRecently an article titled, \"My Instagram's Perfect, My Real Life is Not,\" described the author's myriad of professional and personal problems. It's a laundry list of millennial angst framed by a line that appears midway through the story. Everything in her real life was going wrong, but, she says, \"you wouldn't know any of this if you were to look at my social media presence.\"\n\nIt's not an uncommon story. In 200 years from now aliens, who will only understand the world through dead Instagram accounts, will believe that everyone lived perfect, #blessed lives filled with the wonders of avocado toast and gorgeous sunsets. Carefully curated Instagram pages, and a woman who loves them, are at the heart of \"Ingrid Goes West,\" a new film starring Aubrey Plaza and Elizabeth Olsen.\n\nPlaza plays Ingrid, a lonely New Yorker who befriends people on Instagram only to get upset when they don't let her into their lives. \"Lame and basic,\" Ingrid goes so far as to show up, uninvited, to a \"friend's\" wedding with a can of mace. Insta-blocked after that event, she fixates on Taylor Sloane (Olsen), a Californian social media star with a seemingly perfect life. With inherited money from her late mother's estate, Ingrid, as the title tells us, goes west in search of the perfect life she sees on her phone everyday.\n\nWith a fat bank account and plenty of nerve -- Ingrid kidnaps Taylor's dog so she can return him and insinuate herself into her life -- she becomes friends with the InstaStar and her artist husband (Russell Wyatt). At first everything is hunky dory.\n\n\"You're so funny. You're so awesome. You're the greatest person I have ever met,\" gushes Taylor after knowing Ingrid for only a day. Soon, though, Ingrid is exposed to be a possessive sociopath -- a single white female for the Internet age -- who gets jealous when Taylor hangs out or worse, is photographed with other people, and even her own brother.\n\n\"Ingrid Goes West\" has the makings of either a comedy or psychological thriller but mostly plays like a cautionary tale. A portrait of a woman who buys into the InstaMyth of an effortlessly curated life, it's a withering comment on the real stories behind social media's hashtagged pictures. \"Likes\" do not equal love.\n\nAt the heart of this is Plaza, an actor unafraid to plumb the depths of desperation in her characters. Unlikeable in almost every way, Ingrid is as deep as a lunch tray and yet, because Plaza plays her as a human and not simply a caricature, she remains compelling.\n\nOlsen, whose famous twin sisters were proto-Instagram stars, embodies the kind of superficial social media maven who thinks nothing of asking -- with a perfect vocal fry -- a stranger to lay on the ground to take the perfect \"candid\" shot of her fabulous life. She's the neo-American Dream, a perfectly fluffy confection with a dark heart and a permanent spot on the guest list for every hot club in town.\n\nOn the sidelines, but still memorable is O'Shea Jackson as Ingrid's Batman-obsessed landlord Dan. He isn't given much to do -- he spends more time reading comics than cruising Instagram -- but is a likeable and charming presence.\n\n\"Ingrid Goes West\" essays the phony baloney world of social media but does so with grace and depth, exposing the disconnect many people feel in a digital world.\n\nGOOD TIME: 3 \u00bd STARS\n\nWith \"Good Time,\" Robert Pattinson may finally have put a stake through the heart of his most famous character. The man formerly known as \"Twilight's\" sexy vampire sheds Edward Cullen's glittery to play the reckless brother of an imprisoned man. The former heartthrob has taken creative risks before in his work with David Cronenberg but with the gritty \"Good Time,\" he has finally found the kind of critical reaction his ex co-star Kristen Stewart has been basking in for years since their franchise flew off into the night.\n\nThe action in \"Good Time\" stems from two brothers, Nik and Constantine Nikas, played by co-director Ben Safdie and Pattinson respectively. They live with their grandmother, but fledgling criminal Connie's main job is looking out for Nik who struggles with a learning disability. \"It's just you and me,\" Connie says. \"I'm your friend. Alright?\"\n\nThe ill-advised bank robbery goes south when a paint bomb hiding in the cash explodes covering them in red dye and landing Nik in jail. Connie plots to raise the $10,000 bail needed to spring his brother out of Rikers Island hospital. \"I've got to get him out of there before something bad happens,\" says Connie. \"He could get killed in there.\" As the night grows longer, Connie's situation becomes complicated and dangerous.\n\nCo-directors Benny Safdie and Josh Safdie are not action directors. They shoot in tight close ups, building tension instead with a propulsive electronic score by Oneohtrix Point Never (a.k.a. Daniel Lopatin) mixed with tightly edited visuals. The result is anxiety inducing, occasionally darkly funny and unrelentingly grim. There is an \"After Hours\" vibe to \"Good Time\" -- the action takes place in one evening escalating with every passing moment -- but it's violent and intense, the opposite of a feel good movie.\n\nPattinson embodies every scuzzy synapse of Connie. Nonviolent, kind hearted even -- \"You've got to change this. I don't want to see them justify this,\" he says after watching TV shows where police violently take down a suspect. But dangerous Connie is compelling because of his desperation. As the situation spirals out-of-control Connie, driven by need to protect his brother, makes mistake after mistake.\n\nYou can practically smell his cigarette breath and sweat in a career high that really captures the late night desperation of a man on a mission.\n\nAlso strong in a role that amounts to little more than an extended cameo, Jennifer Jason Leigh plays Connie's girlfriend, an hysterical woman just a step or two away from the reality of the situation. In her brief time on screen, she makes an impression, adding to the story's chaotic feel.\n\n\"Good Time\" is the movie equivalent of a panic attack, nasty around the edges and rattling to the brain.", "id": "9869365", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Movie reviews: 'The Hitman's Bodyguard' succeeds due to chemistry between actors", "image":

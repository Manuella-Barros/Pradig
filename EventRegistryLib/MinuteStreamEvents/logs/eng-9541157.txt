Since the creation of this state and especially since the return of democracy, we have been blessed with very patriotic and dedicated leaders, from the days of Obong Victor Attah to the uncommon era of my grandfather, the senate president, to my political father, the immediate past Governor Udom Emmanuel to date.\n\n\"Past governors before me did a lot for the state during their times; all we have to do now is maintain those facilities and also put in place some new infrastructure where necessary.\n\n\"As a government, we will continue to partner with you and President Tinubu. Your love and commitment to the unity of our dear state are enough to put the state on a high pedestal of development.\n\nGod brought me at this time, by His grace, to bring about the reconciliation of His people. As they say, united we stand, divided we fall. If we must get anything for our state at the federal level and want our state to remain the envy of others, we have no alternative but to work together as a team.\"\n\nHe, however, appealed to the Senate President not to truncate the governorship succession plan laid down in the state by successive approximations since the return of democracy in 1999 by allowing him to see through his eight years, as was the case of Obong Victor Attah (1999-2007), Chief Godswill Akpabio (2007-2015), and Mr. Udom Emmanuel (2015-2023).\n\nAlso speaking, the Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission, Dr. Samuel Ogbuku, appreciated the cordial relationship between the Senate President and the State Governor, saying it would help hasten the development of the state.\n\nOgbuku said even though the governor and the Senate President came from different political parties, they had come together in unity to develop the state.\n\nHe said, \"I thank the people of Akwa Ibom State for teaching other parts of the country a lesson in peace and unity in party politics, devoid of affiliation, as exemplified by Governor Umo Eno, for embracing the leadership and giving support to Senator Akpabio.\n\n\"Irrespective of the fact that the governor and the Senate President come from different parties, they have come together in unity to develop the state.\"\n\nHe thanked the governor for the support he was giving the Senate President and urged him not to be distracted by enemies of progress.\n\nThe NDDC MD also applauded the leadership qualities of Akpabio, saying his disposition as a leader had united the National Assembly across party lines\n\n\"On behalf of the board and management of the NDDC, I want to appreciate the Senate President, Godswill Akpabio, for his leadership qualities, which have helped unite the National Assembly along party lines,\" he stressed.", "source": {"uri": "tribuneonlineng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tribune Online"}, "authors":

Godswill Akpabio, has urged Nigerians to be patient with President Bola Tinubu, as he labours to fix the economy.\n\nAkpabio, who described the economy as \"foamy\", said it was left wobbling by the embattled former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor, Godwin Emefiele, whom he alleged created a very big hole in the national treasury.\n\nHe said Tinubu inherited a battered economy which he is currently trying to salvage and navigate away from the stranglehold of sleaze and corruption.\n\nThe Senate president made the plea at Ikot Ekpene Stadium over the weekend, when his kinsmen from Akwa Ibom North-West Senatorial District hosted him and his National Assembly colleagues in an elaborate welcome reception since taking the Senate Presidential mantle last year.\n\nHe recalled that his earlier remarks on Emefiele being the major culprit responsible for failure of the economy, had drawn the ire of the former CBN boss, who took him (Akpabio) to court, but maintained that; \"I still stand by my position,\" despite the court case.\n\nExpressing optimism and confidence in the economy bouncing back stronger, Akpabio assured that President Tinubu, has the magic wand to retool the economy and put it back on the trajectory of growth as he did as governor of Lagos State which became one of the most bouyant economies in Africa.\n\nHe said the knowledge and political ingenuity of three former governors, namely Tinubu as President; Kashim Shettima, former Borno State Governor (Vice President) and himself, as former Akwa Ibom State governor, will help the country return to the right economic path.\n\nHe assured the people of the state, the South-South region and the country, of all - round federal presence, assuring that the coastal road coming all the way from Lagos to Calabar, would cut across various states in the South West, South East and the South South political zones, with attendant socio -economic developments.\n\nThe Senate President also assured the host governor, Pastor Umo Eno, of the Deep Seaport, and other federal government projects and urged him to liaise with the managing director (MD) of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Chief Samuel Ogbuku, to extend the ongoing road project from the neighbouring Abia State to Ini, Ikono, Ikot Ekpene to connect Uyo, the State tate capital.\n\n\"You have asked for Seaport, you will not only get Seaport, you will get roads, flyovers, and other federal projects, and we are going to do this because of you,\" he stressed.\n\nHe however urged the governor to live above board as a Pastor, to which the governor agreed.\n\nHowever, governor Eno, who joined others to welcome Akpabio, thanked President Tinubu, for finding an Akwa Ibom son fitting for the exalted position of number three citizen, and pledged to work with the centre, in spite of political party differences to bring development to the state.\n\nHe, therefore, appealed to the Senate President, not to truncate the governorship succession plan laid down in the State by successive approximations since the return of democracy in 1999, by allowing him to see through his eight years as was the case of Obong Victor Attah (1999-2007); Chief Godswill Akpabio (2007 -2015) and Mr. Udom Emmanuel (2015-2023).\n\nDeputy Senate President, Jibrin Barau, and the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Benjamin Kalu, extolled the leadership virtues of Senator Akpabio.", "source": {"uri": "leadership.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Leadership"}, "authors": [{"uri": "iniobong_ekponta@leadership.ng", "name":

declares  - Pointblank News", "body": "While urging Nigerians to be patient with President Bola Tinubu's administration, Akpabio alleged that Emefiele \"left a very big hole in the national treasury\".\n\nAkpabio stressed that President Tinubu inherited a battered economy which he is currently trying to rally cash and deploying his knowledge to salvage and navigate away from the stranglehold of sleaze and corruption.\n\nAkpabio stated this at Ikot Ekpene Stadium over the weekend when his kinsmen from Akwa Ibom North-West Senatorial District hosted him and his National Assembly colleagues in a reception since he became the president of the Senate last year.\n\nOn his earlier remark about Emefiele being responsible for Nigeria's economic woes, Akpabio said, \"I still stand by my position\".\n\nExpressing optimism and confidence in the economy bouncing back stronger, Akpabio assured that President Tinubu has the magic wand to retool the economy back on the trajectory of growth as he did as Governor under which Lagos became one of the most buoyant economies in Africa.\n\nHe stressed that with three former governors, Tinubu, a former Governor of Lagos State, as President; Kashim Shettima, former Borno State Governor as Vice President, and himself, former Akwa Ibom State governor, their knowledge and ingenuity in politics and socio-economic governance would be aggregated and galvanized to rescue the country for the greater good of Nigerians.\n\nAkpabio assured the people of the state, the South-South region and the country of all-round federal presence, adding that the coastal road coming all the way from Lagos to Calabar would cut across various states in the Southwest, South-East and the South-South political zones, with attendant socio-economic developments.\n\nThe Senate President also assured the host governor, Pastor Umo Eno of the Deep Seaport, and other federal government projects, and urged him to liaise with the Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Chief Samuel Ogbuku, to extend the ongoing road project from the neighbouring Abia State to Ini, Ikono, Ikot Ekpene to connect Uyo, the state capital.\n\n\"You have asked of seaport, you will not only get Seaport, you get roads, flyovers, and other federal projects, and we are going to do this because of you,\" he stressed.\n\nIn his remarks, Governor Eno pledged to work with the Tinubu administration in spite of political party differences to bring development to the state.\n\nHe appealed to the Senate President not to truncate the governorship succession plan laid down in the state by successive approximations since the return of democracy in 1999, by allowing him to see through his eight years as was the case of Obong Victor Attah (1999-2007); Chief Godswill Akpabio (2007 -2015) and Mr. Udom Emmanuel (2015-2023).\n\nDeputy Senate President, Jibrin Barau, and the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Benjamin Kalu, also extolled the leadership virtues of Senator Akpabio, noting that as the National Assembly Chairman, he has been a stabilising influence and 'Unifier-in-Chief' who is engendering the executive-legislative harmony.", "source": {"uri": "pointblanknews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pointblank News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I know you've been in the state several times because it is your home, but this is the first official visit to the state seat of government since you left. Tonight is a historic night in Akwa Ibom and, indeed, in Nigeria. Party politics is over. Even though we belong to different political parties, the love and support we have received from you as our big brother has united us; reach out to us, work with us, advise, and counsel us.\n\n\"For me as a person, I believe that God brought me here by grace to bring about reconciliation of our people. Nigerians can come and see how people can work together across party lines, and I think this is a real collaboration that Nigerians need at this time.\"\n\nIn his remarks, Akpabio relished the governor's conduct in not criticising the administration of Tinubu despite being in the opposition party and experiencing the current economic realities that he said were happening around the world after the advent of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"It is well with you, and it is well with my state. I want to extend the goodwill and felicitation of the Federal Government to Governor Uma Eno. I want to assure you that if there is anything the National Assembly can do for any government, we will do so for you. I'm expected to sit here and criticise you because I'm not in the same political party as you, and you are expected to sit there and criticise Asiwaju (Tinubu) and the Federal Government, but I think that elections are over, and we are now doing governance.\n\n\"So we must work together across party lines. And a time like this with the difficulties in the country and all over the world, after COVID-19, many countries are in recession even United Kingdom. It is important that we don't add sorrow to the people through divisive policies. Unite your people,\" the Senate President noted.\n\nEno further maintained that his administration would continue to support the Federal Government as there was no need to be confrontational.\n\n\"If we can get anything for our state. If our state becomes great. If our state becomes the place of envy as it is and continues to grow, we will have no alternative other than to work together. If we miss this opportunity, I don't know when else. We need that synergy, and this is the best opportunity.\n\n\"Our father, the President, will succeed; all of us need to give him that support; we need to give him that understanding; we need to work together across party lines to solve myriads of problems. I believe that the solution to Nigeria's problem does not lie in one person or party, but when God chooses a leader, everyone relies on that leader.\n\n\"We all need to come together to support the President and interpret his vision so that Nigerians can benefit from one another and enjoy the dividends of democracy.

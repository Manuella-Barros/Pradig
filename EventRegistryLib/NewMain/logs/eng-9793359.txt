On the other hand, Greg Brockman, OpenAI president and one of the co-founders has gone on a \"sabbatical\" through the end of this year. First reported by The Information, and officially confirmed by Schulman and Brockman on X, it seems OpenAI leadership is again going through some transition.\n\nAfter Jan Leike resigned from OpenAI and joined Anthropic in May over a lack of compute for alignment research and safety concerns, John Schulman became the head of alignment research at the company. Schulman was also recently made a member of the OpenAI Safety Committee. In that context, the resignation seems to be particularly surprising.\n\nThat said, Schulman says, \"To be clear, I'm not leaving due to lack of support for alignment research at OpenAI. On the contrary, company leaders have been very committed to investing in this area.\" His decision to join Anthropic is \"personal\" and geared towards gaining \"new perspectives and do research alongside people deeply engaged with the topics I'm most interested in.\"\n\nGreg Brockman, who is seen as a close confidant of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, says, \"I'm taking a sabbatical through end of year.

In May, OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever announced his resignation from the company.\n\nSutskever leaving OpenAI wasn't a huge surprise, given that he'd worked with fellow board members to oust Altman as CEO in November. He started his own AI company, Safe Superintelligence Inc., a month after resigning from OpenAI.\n\nSutskever's departure coincided with other top-level exits, including his co-lead for OpenAI's superalignment team, Jan Leike. Like Schulman, Leike is now working at Anthropic.\n\n\"I joined because I thought OpenAI would be the best place in the world to do this research,\" Leike wrote on X in May. \"But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.\"\n\nDisagreements over OpenAI's approach toward innovation appear to be a key bugbear for some of its departed cofounders, and nowhere has that been clearer than with former board member Elon Musk.\n\nMusk left the company's board in 2018, citing a conflict of interest related to his work at Tesla. But Musk has since gone on the offensive, publicly criticizing and taking legal action against the company.\n\nThe mercurial billionaire first sued OpenAI in February, accusing Altman and the company of violating its nonprofit mission by partnering with Microsoft. Musk initially dropped the lawsuit in June, only to sue the company again on Monday.\n\n\"OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it 'Open' AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft,\" Musk wrote on X in February 2023. \"Not what I intended at all.\"\n\nTo be sure, not everyone has left OpenAI on such acrimonious terms.\n\nNotably, cofounder Andrej Karpathy had two stints with OpenAI, the first from 2015 to 2017, and the second from 2023 to 2024. Karpathy spent the interim period from 2017 to 2022 at Musk's Tesla, where he served as the EV giant's senior director of AI.\n\n\"First of all nothing 'happened' and it's not a result of any particular event, issue or drama (but please keep the conspiracy theories coming as they are highly entertaining :)),\" Karpathy wrote on X in February after leaving OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthropic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AI alignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojciech_Zaremba", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wojciech Zaremba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TechCrunch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrej_Karpathy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrej Karpathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open source model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/The-core-crew-that-helped-Sam-Altman-start-OpenAI-has.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793359", "eventUri": "eng-9793359", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

The news of Brockman's and Deng's departures was earlier reported by The Information.\n\nA spokesperson shared this statement about Schulman: \"We're grateful for John's contributions as a founding team member at OpenAI and his dedicated efforts in advancing alignment research. His passion and hard work have established a strong foundation that will inspire and support future innovations at OpenAI and the broader field.\"\n\nSchulman posted about the decision on X today, saying that it stemmed from a desire to deepen his focus on AI alignment -- the science of ensuring AI behaves as intended -- and engage in more hands-on technical work.\n\n\"I've decided to pursue this goal at Anthropic, where I believe I can gain new perspectives and do research alongside people deeply engaged with the topics I'm most interested in,\" Schulman said. \"I am confident that OpenAI and the teams I was part of will continue to thrive without me.\"\n\nSchulman's involvement with OpenAI began shortly after he completed a Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley. He played a pivotal role in creating the AI-powered chatbot platform ChatGPT by leading OpenAI's reinforcement training org, which fine-tunes generative AI models to follow human instructions.\n\nFollowing the departure of AI safety researcher Jan Leike (who also now works at Anthropic), Schulman became the head of OpenAI's alignment science efforts, also known as the \"post-training\" team. He was also a member of OpenAI's recently formed safety committee; it's unclear who might replace Schulman in that role.\n\nDespite the controversies swirling around OpenAI, particularly with regard to the company's approach to and treatment of AI safety research, Schulman said that he wasn't leaving OpenAI due to a lack of support.\n\n\"Company leaders have been very committed to investment in [alignment research],\" Schulman said. \"My decision is a personal one, based on how I want to focus my efforts in the next phase of my career.\"\n\nWith Schulman's departure, only three of OpenAI's 11 original founders remain: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Brockman and Wojciech Zaremba, lead of language and code generation.\n\n\"Thank you for everything you've done for OpenAI!\" wrote Altman to Schulman in a post on X.\" You are a brilliant researcher, a deep thinker about product and society, and mostly, you are a great friend to all of us.

The leaders of OpenAI superalignment team, Jan Leike and company co-founder Ilya Sutskever, both left the company this year. John Schulman plans to leave OpenAI\n\nThe move comes less than three months after OpenAI disbanded a superalignment team that focused on trying to ensure that people can control AI systems that exceed human capability at many tasks.\n\nSchulman had been a co-leader of OpenAI's post-training team that refined AI models for the ChatGPT chatbot and a programming interface for third-party developers, according to a biography on his website. In June, OpenAI said Schulman, as head of alignment science, would join a safety and security committee that would provide advice to the board. Schulman has only worked at OpenAI since receiving a Ph.D. in computer science in 2016 from the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\"This choice stems from my desire to deepen my focus on AI alignment and to start a new chapter of my career where I can return to hands-on technical work,\" Schulman wrote in the social media post.\n\nHe said he wasn't leaving because of a lack of support for new work on the topic at OpenAI.\n\n\"On the contrary, company leaders have been very committed to investing in this area,\" he said.\n\nEarlier exit from OpenAI\n\nThe leaders of the superalignment team, Jan Leike and company co-founder Ilya Sutskever, both left this year. Leike joined Anthropic, while Sutskever said he was helping to start a new company, Safe Superintelligence Inc.\n\nSince OpenAI staff members established Anthropic in 2021, the two young San Francisco-based businesses have been battling to have the most performant generative AI models that can come up with human-like text. Amazon, Google, and Meta have also developed large language models.\n\n\"Very excited to be working together again!\" Leike wrote in reply to Schulman's message.\n\nSam Altman, OpenAI's co-founder and CEO, said in a post of his own that Schulman's perspective informed the startup's early strategy.\n\nOpeanAI in-house crisis\n\nSchulman and others chose to leave after the board pushed out Altman as chief last November. Employees protested the decision, prompting Sutskever and two other board members, Tasha McCauley and Helen Toner, to resign. Altman was reinstated and OpenAI took on additional board members.\n\nToner said on a podcast that Altman had given the board incorrect information about the \"small number of formal safety processes that the company did have in place.\"\n\nThe law firm WilmerHale found in an independent review that the board wasn't concerned about product safety when it pushed out Altman.\n\nLast week, Altman said on X that OpenAI \"has been working with the US AI Safety Institute on an agreement where we would provide early access to our next foundation model so that we can work together to push forward the science of AI evaluations.\" Altman said OpenAI is still committed to keeping 20% of its computing resources for safety initiatives.\n\nAlso on Monday, Greg Brockman, another co-founder of OpenAI and its president, announced that he was taking a sabbatical for the rest of the year.\n\nRelated Items:Anthropic, Artifcial intelligence, OpenAI Recommended for you British Antitrust Agency

However, eight of OpenAI's cofounders have since left the company. One of the remaining cofounders, president Greg Brockman said he was going on sabbatical on Monday.\n\nOpenAI is barely a decade old, but nearly three-quarters of its founding team has left its top ranks since its inception.\n\nOn Monday, the company's cofounder and head of its alignment science efforts, John Schulman, said he'd \"made the difficult decision\" to leave OpenAI for its rival Anthropic.\n\n\"This choice stems from my desire to deepen my focus on AI alignment, and to start a new chapter of my career where I can return to hands-on technical work,\" Schulman wrote in an X post.\n\n\"To be clear, I'm not leaving due to lack of support for alignment research at OpenAI,\" he added. \"My decision is a personal one, based on how I want to focus my efforts in the next phase of my career.\"\n\nOpenAI CEO Altman penned a thank-you post to Schulman on X shortly after, praising Schulman as a \"brilliant researcher\" and \"deep thinker about products and society.\"\n\n\"We're grateful for John's contributions as a founding team member at OpenAI and his dedicated efforts in advancing alignment research,\" OpenAI said in a statement to TechCrunch.\n\nThis makes Schulman the eighth cofounder who has left OpenAI since its founding in 2015.\n\nOnly three of the original 11 founding members remain -- Altman, language and code generation lead Wojciech Zaremba, and president Greg Brockman.\n\nBrockman, notably, said on Monday that he will be \"taking a sabbatical through the end of year.\"\n\nBesides Schulman, OpenAI has seen multiple exits among its leadership ranks in recent months. In May, OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever announced his resignation from the company.\n\nSutskever leaving OpenAI wasn't a huge surprise, given that he'd worked with fellow board members to oust Altman as CEO in November. He started his own AI company, Safe Superintelligence Inc., a month after resigning from OpenAI.\n\nSutskever's departure coincided with other top-level exits, including his co-lead for OpenAI's superalignment team, Jan Leike. Like Schulman, Leike is now working at Anthropic.\n\n\"I joined because I thought OpenAI would be the best place in the world to do this research,\" Leike wrote on X in May. \"But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.\"\n\nDisagreements over OpenAI's approach toward innovation appear to be a key bugbear for some of its departed cofounders, and nowhere has that been clearer than with former board member Elon Musk.\n\nMusk left the company's board in 2018, citing a conflict of interest related to his work at Tesla. But Musk has since gone on the offensive, publicly criticizing and taking legal action against the company.\n\nThe mercurial billionaire first sued OpenAI in February, accusing Altman and the company of violating its nonprofit mission by partnering with Microsoft. Musk initially dropped the lawsuit in June, only to sue the company again on Monday.\n\n\"OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it 'Open' AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft,\" Musk wrote on X in February 2023. \"Not what I intended at all.\"\n\nTo be sure, not everyone has left OpenAI on such acrimonious terms.\n\nIn fact, quite a number of them left the company way before it struck gold with ChatGPT in 2022.\n\nRoboticist Trevor Blackwell, software engineer Vicki Cheung, research scientist Durk Kingma, and research engineer Pamela Vagata left the company between 2016 and 2018.\n\nNotably, cofounder Andrej Karpathy had two stints with OpenAI, the first from 2015 to 2017, and the second from 2023 to 2024. Karpathy spent the interim period from 2017 to 2022 at Musk's Tesla, where he served as the EV giant's senior director of AI.\n\n\"First of all nothing 'happened' and it's not a result of any particular event, issue or drama (but please keep the conspiracy theories coming as they are highly entertaining :)),\" Karpathy wrote on X in February after leaving OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthropic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AI alignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojciech_Zaremba", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wojciech Zaremba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TechCrunch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrej_Karpathy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrej Karpathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open source model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Blackwell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Blackwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66b18755a5247369a3e9a5c0?format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793359", "eventUri": "eng-9793359", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

But this team was dissolved after Leike and former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever resigned from the company earlier that month.\n\nLeike spoke out against the company shortly after resigning, claiming he disagreed with OpenAI's leadership about the company's core priorities \"for some time\" and that these issues had reached a \"breaking point\".\n\n\"I believe much more of our bandwidth should be spent getting ready for the next generations of models, on security, monitoring, preparedness, safety, adversarial robustness, (super)alignment, confidentiality, societal impact and related topics,\" he said at the time.\n\nJust last month, OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy, who left the company in February to work on personal projects, announced a new company called Eureka Labs that will enable students to study a wide variety of subjects through its AI platform.\n\n\"Thank you for everything you've done for OpenAI!\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote of Schulman's departure. \"You are a brilliant researcher, a deep thinker about product and society, and mostly, you are a great friend to all of us. We will miss you tremendously and make you proud of this place.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Elon Musk has revived his lawsuit against OpenAI alleging that Altman and Brockman have breached the company's founding contract by placing profits and commercial interests above public good.\n\nMusk decided to sue OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman earlier this year for seeking to profit from its AI creations - only to drop it quietly in June.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in California yesterday, Musk claims that the two \"assiduously manipulated Musk into co-founding their spurious non-profit venture\" by promising that OpenAI would be safer and more transparent than profit-driven alternatives.\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

And earlier this year, several members of the company's safety teams exited.\n\nIlya Sutskever, another one of OpenAI's co-founders and chief scientist, left the company in May. Andrej Karpathy, who was also one of the AI firm's founding members, left in February and started an AI-integrated education platform in July.\n\nSchulman was a co-leader of OpenAI's post-training team, responsible for refining AI models for the ChatGPT chatbot and a programming interface for third-party developers, according to his website biography.\n\nIn June, OpenAI announced that Schulman, as head of alignment science, would join a safety and security committee to advise the board. Schulman had been with OpenAI since earning his Ph.D. in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2016.\n\n\"This choice stems from my desire to deepen my focus on AI alignment and start a new chapter of my career where I can return to hands-on technical work,\" Schulman wrote in the social media post on X.\n\nHe clarified that his departure was not due to a lack of support for AI alignment at OpenAI. \"On the contrary, company leaders have been very committed to investing in this area,\" he said.\n\nJan Leike and Ilya Sutskever, leaders of the former superalignment team, both left OpenAI this year. Leike joined Anthropic, while Sutskever said he was starting a new company, Safe Superintelligence Inc.\n\nSince its establishment by former OpenAI staff in 2021, Anthropic has been competing with OpenAI to develop the most advanced generative AI models capable of producing human-like text. Amazon, Google, and Meta have also developed large language models.\n\n\"Very excited to be working together again!\" Leike wrote in response to Schulman's message.\n\nSam Altman, OpenAI's co-founder and CEO, noted in his own post that Schulman's insights had shaped the startup's early strategy.\n\nSchulman and others chose to leave after the board ousted Altman as CEO last November. Employee protests led to the resignations of Sutskever and two other board members, Tasha McCauley and Helen Toner. Altman was reinstated, and OpenAI added new board members.\n\nToner mentioned on a podcast that Altman had provided the board with incorrect information regarding the company's limited formal safety processes.\n\nAn independent review by law firm WilmerHale found that the board was not concerned about product safety when it removed Altman.\n\nLast week, Altman said on X that OpenAI \"has been working with the U.S. AI Safety Institute on an agreement to provide early access to our next foundation model to advance the science of AI evaluations.\" He affirmed that OpenAI remains committed to dedicating 20% of its computing resources to safety initiatives.\n\nThe leadership changes come shortly after reports that Microsoft and Apple withdrew their bids for board seats at OpenAI amidst increasing antitrust scrutiny of the company and its partners.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, who was also one of the co-founders of OpenAI and left three years later, refiled his lawsuit against the company

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nOpenAI's head of alignment, John Schulman, who was responsible for tailoring its model responses to align with values, has left the company to work with Amazon backed Anthropic. Anthropic and OpenAI have a shared history, and the former comprises former executives from the latter who decided to set up their own company. Schulman announced his decision on X, and he was met with responses from OpenAI chief Sam Altman and others who appreciated the time they had spent together working at the company.\n\nSchulman's X post comes just after a report from The Information claimed that OpenAI's president, Greg Brockman, had taken an extended leave while a product manager, Peter Deng, was also leaving the company. Schulman, who was responsible for overseeing model alignment at OpenAI, will now work at Amazon backed Anthropic. Anthropic was founded by former OpenAI members, and Schulman's departure means that few of OpenAI's founding members now remain at the company -- Brockman and Altman being two of them.\n\nAs OpenAI's head of alignment, Schulman was responsible for ensuring that the firm's products, such as ChatGPT, produced outputs that were in line with a predefined set of values. Some examples include tailoring responses against widely held beliefs and restricting harmful outputs to ensure that all responses generated by AI models are safe for human use.\n\nIn his statement, Schulman shares that he is leaving OpenAI to \"deepen\" his focus on AI alignment and \"return to hands-on technical work.\" He adds that the decision does not stem from any lack of focus on alignment at OpenAI but is a \"personal one.\"\n\nAfter his departure, along with Altman and Brockman, the third OpenAI founder currently working at the firm is its head of language and code generation, Wojciech Zaremba.\n\nResponding to Schulman's announcement, OpenAI CEO Altman thanked Schulman for the work he had performed at the company. Altman also shared details of his first meeting with Schulman, revealing that they had met at a cafe at the University of California, Berkley, where they talked about artificial general intelligence.\n\nAs opposed to ChatGPT, which is narrow intelligence, artificial general intelligence or AGI is the end goal of all AI firms as it seeks to create software that can deliver multi faceted outputs that mimic the cognitive capabilities of a human being.\n\nSchulman's departure follows that of AI safety researcher Jan Leike in May, Leike left OpenAI after the firm dissolved an alignment team and he joined the Amazon backed Anthropic to lead its alignment efforts. After Leiki left, Schulman took over what OpenAI dubs as 'post training.' His post stressed that post training \"is in good hands and has a deep bench of amazing talent\" and is \"coming together with some promising projects.\"", "source": {"uri": "wccftech.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wccftech"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ramish_zafar@wccftech.com", "name": "Ramish Zafar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthropic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AI alignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojciech_Zaremba", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wojciech Zaremba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Berkeley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/OpenAI-tool-e1722856197626.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793359", "eventUri": "eng-9793359", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

In May, OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever announced his resignation from the company.\n\nSutskever leaving OpenAI wasn't a huge surprise, given that he'd worked with fellow board members to oust Altman as CEO in November. He started his own AI company, Safe Superintelligence Inc., a month after resigning from OpenAI.\n\nSutskever's departure coincided with other top-level exits, including his co-lead for OpenAI's superalignment team, Jan Leike. Like Schulman, Leike is now working at Anthropic.\n\n\"I joined because I thought OpenAI would be the best place in the world to do this research,\" Leike wrote on X in May. \"But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.\"\n\nDisagreements over OpenAI's approach toward innovation appear to be a key bugbear for some of its departed cofounders, and nowhere has that been clearer than with former board member Elon Musk.\n\nMusk left the company's board in 2018, citing a conflict of interest related to his work at Tesla. But Musk has since gone on the offensive, publicly criticizing and taking legal action against the company.\n\nThe mercurial billionaire first sued OpenAI in February, accusing Altman and the company of violating its nonprofit mission by partnering with Microsoft. Musk initially dropped the lawsuit in June, only to sue the company again on Monday.\n\n\"OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it 'Open' AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft,\" Musk wrote on X in February 2023. \"Not what I intended at all.\"\n\nTo be sure, not everyone has left OpenAI on such acrimonious terms.\n\nNotably, cofounder Andrej Karpathy had two stints with OpenAI, the first from 2015 to 2017, and the second from 2023 to 2024. Karpathy spent the interim period from 2017 to 2022 at Musk's Tesla, where he served as the EV giant's senior director of AI.\n\n\"First of all nothing 'happened' and it's not a result of any particular event, issue or drama (but please keep the conspiracy theories coming as they are highly entertaining :)),\" Karpathy wrote on X in February after leaving OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TechCrunch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthropic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojciech_Zaremba", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wojciech Zaremba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrej_Karpathy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrej Karpathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open source model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66b1879ea5247369a3e9a5ca?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793359", "eventUri": "eng-9793359", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

On the contrary, company leaders have been very committed to investing in this area,\" he added.\n\nAlso on Monday, OpenAI's president Greg Brockman announced on social media site X that he would take the rest of the year off. \"I'm taking a sabbatical through end of year. First time to relax since co-founding OpenAI 9 years ago. The mission is far from complete; we still have a safe AGI to build,\" he wrote, referring to artificial general intelligence, or AI that can match or better a human's cognitive ability.\n\nThe exits, first reported by The Information, follow a tumultuous period at the San Francisco company. OpenAI has rocketed to an $86bn valuation since releasing ChatGPT in November 2022, and has rolled out a series of chatbots able to perform increasingly complex tasks.\n\nThe company has faced criticism over the pace of its AI development and direction of its research. Those concerns spilled over during a boardroom crisis last November in which Brockman and chief executive Sam Altman were ousted.\n\nThe pair returned to their roles within five days, following a campaign from employees and investors. Directors who voted to remove Altman for not being \"consistently candid\" have since been replaced, with Quora's chief executive Adam D'Angelo the only director to have remained through the crisis.\n\nHowever, some of the concerns raised in November have been echoed by former employees in the months since.\n\nElon Musk, who helped launch OpenAI but left the board in 2018 after clashing with Altman, filed a lawsuit on Monday alleging OpenAI and its chief executive had reneged on a mission to benefit humanity when they struck a commercial partnership with Microsoft, which has committed $13bn to OpenAI since 2019.\n\nA number of other senior staff have left to pursue their own projects, with some critical of OpenAI's approach. Jan Leike, a prominent member of Sutskever's safety-focused \"superalignment team\", left in May and criticised the company's efforts to ensure AI could be responsibly developed and deployed.\n\n\"Over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a back seat to shiny products,\" wrote Leike, who also joined Anthropic, in a post on X.\n\nAndrej Karpathy, another founding member of OpenAI in 2015, departed in February to work on his own AI project.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthropic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AI alignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrej_Karpathy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrej Karpathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_D'Angelo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam D'Angelo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quora", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252F16fa982c-4673-4edf-91cb-ce3e61bce8ee.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793359", "eventUri": "eng-9793359", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Another co-founder, Andrej Karpathy, has also left the company.\n\nAnthropic was launched in 2021 by ex-OpenAI engineers and siblings Daniela and Dario Amodei, who left that startup over concerns that it was scaling up its tech too quickly -- and without adequate safeguards. They were joined by at least nine other OpenAI employees.\n\nSchulman's announcement was met with appreciation for his time at OpenAI; CEO Sam Altman wrote on X that Schulman's perspective on the future of AI helped inform the company's strategy. \"Very excited to be working together again!\" Leike wrote in a reply to Schulman.\n\nOpenAI President Greg Brockman on Monday announced he would be taking a sabbatical from the company through the end of 2024, writing on X that it would be his \"first time to relax since co-founding OpenAI 9 years ago.\" Both executives' moves -- as well as the departure of product leader Peter Deng -- were first reported by The Information.\n\nThe executive shakeup came less than a day after Tesla CEO and xAI founder Elon Musk revived his lawsuit against OpenAI, which he helped launch and fund. The lawsuit accused Altman and Brockman of \"manipulating\" Musk and \"deceit of Shakespearean proportions.\"", "source": {"uri": "qz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Quartz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthropic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning_(machine_learning)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fine-tuning (machine learning)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AI alignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrej_Karpathy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrej Karpathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Sutskever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/3655df45d76a0be53a49e02aa9c9e8b0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793359", "eventUri": "eng-9793359", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

ChatGPT has made writing computer code and cheating on homework easier. Soon, it could make email scams a cinch. That's the warning from Darktrace Plc, the British cybersecurity firm.\n\nOpenAI co-founder John Schulman said in a Monday X post that he would leave the Microsoft-backed company and join Anthropic, an artificial intelligence startup with funding from Amazon.\n\nThe move comes less than three months after OpenAI disbanded a superalignment team that focused on trying to ensure that people can control AI systems that exceed human capability at many tasks.\n\nSchulman had been a co-leader of OpenAI's post-training team that refined AI models for the ChatGPT chatbot and a programming interface for third-party developers, according to a biography on his website. In June, OpenAI said Schulman, as head of alignment science, would join a safety and security committee that would provide advice to the board. Schulman has only worked at OpenAI since receiving a Ph.D. in computer science in 2016 from the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\"This choice stems from my desire to deepen my focus on AI alignment, and to start a new chapter of my career where I can return to hands-on technical work,\" Schulman wrote in the social media post.\n\nHe said he wasn't leaving because of a lack of support for new work on the topic at OpenAI.\n\n\"On the contrary, company leaders have been very committed to investing in this area,\" he said.\n\nThe leaders of the superalignment team, Jan Leike and company co-founder Ilya Sutskever, both left this year. Leike joined Anthropic, while Sutskever said he was helping to start a new company, Safe Superintelligence Inc.\n\nSince OpenAI staff members established Anthropic in 2021, the two young San Francisco-based businesses have been battling to have the most performant generative AI models that can come up with human-like text. Amazon, Google and Meta have also developed large language models.\n\n\"Very excited to be working together again!\" Leike wrote in reply to Schulman's message.\n\nSam Altman, OpenAI's co-founder and CEO, said in a post of his own that Schulman's perspective informed the startup's early strategy.\n\nSchulman and others chose to leave after the board pushed out Altman as chief last November. Employees protested the decision, prompting Sutskever and two other board members, Tasha McCauley and Helen Toner, to resign. Altman was reinstated and OpenAI took on additional board members.\n\nToner said on a podcast that Altman had given the board incorrect information about the \"small number of formal safety processes that the company did have in place.\"\n\nThe law firm WilmerHale found in an independent review that the board wasn't concerned about product safety when it pushed out Altman.\n\nLast week, Altman said on X that OpenAI \"has been working with the US AI Safety Institute on an agreement where we would provide early access to our next foundation model so that we can work together to push forward the science of AI evaluations.\" Altman said OpenAI is still committed to keeping 20% of its computing resources for safety initiatives.\n\nAlso on Monday, Greg Brockman, another co-founder of OpenAI

First time to relax since co-founding OpenAI 9 years ago,\" said Brockman, highlighting that the mission is far from complete; they still have a safe AGI to build.\n\nMeanwhile, Schulman announced his intentions of joining Anthropic, stating, \"This choice stems from my desire to deepen my focus on AI alignment and to start a new chapter of my career where I can return to hands-on technical work.\"\n\nFurther, he clarified, saying \"To be clear, I'm not leaving due to lack of support for alignment research at OpenAI. My decision is a personal one, based on how I want to focus my efforts in the next phase of my career.\"\n\nIt looks like Schulman left the company while remaining in their good books. Sam Altman thanked Schulman for his contributions to OpenAI, calling him \"a brilliant researcher, a deep thinker about product and society, and mostly, you are a great friend to all of us,\" reminiscing about their first meeting in 2015, where Schulman laid out much of OpenAI's initial strategy in just 15 minutes.\n\nHowever, the reason for Deng leaving the company remains unknown. It is most likely that he's planning to start his own AI venture, given his passion and experience in building products like ChatGPT.\n\nThis development follows the departure of former OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy, who left to start his own AI company, Eureka Labs. Eureka Labs is an AI+Education company focused on creating an AI-native learning environment. The goal of Eureka Labs is to revolutionise education by integrating generative AI with traditional teaching methods.\n\nPreviously, Ilya Sutskever, chief scientist at OpenAI, also announced his resignation and launched a new company called Safe SuperIntelligence. This venture is dedicated to developing advanced and safe AI systems, with a strong emphasis on safety alongside capabilities. Sutskever's new company aims to create superintelligent AI systems that are both advanced and secure, while avoiding the distractions and pressures faced by larger AI firms.\n\nAlong with Sutsekver, Jan Leike, OpenAI's head of alignment, also resigned and joined Anthropic. Leike announced he would continue working on the \"super alignment mission\", focusing on scalable oversight, weak-to-strong generalisation, and automated alignment research.\n\nThe OpenAI mafia is just getting bigger and bigger with each passing day.

Schulman, who played a pivotal role in the development of OpenAI's AI alignment research and the reinforcement training of models like ChatGPT, announced his decision to transition to Anthropic via a post on X.\n\nHe expressed a desire to deepen his focus on AI alignment and engage in more hands-on technical work. Schulman believes that Anthropic will offer new perspectives and opportunities to pursue his research interests alongside like-minded experts.\n\nIn addition to Schulman's departure, OpenAI has confirmed that president and co-founder Greg Brockman is taking an extended leave until the end of the year. Brockman, who has been with the company for nine years, plans to use this time to relax and recharge.\n\nThis news follows the earlier exit of Peter Deng, a product manager who joined OpenAI last year after leading product teams at Meta, Uber, and Airtable. Deng's departure had already been reported by The Information.\n\nA spokesperson for OpenAI expressed gratitude for Schulman's contributions, highlighting his role in advancing alignment research and establishing a foundation for future innovations. Despite Schulman's departure, the spokesperson conveyed confidence that OpenAI's alignment research efforts would continue to thrive.\n\nSchulman's involvement with OpenAI began after he completed his Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley.\n\nHis work at OpenAI was instrumental in the creation of ChatGPT, where he led the reinforcement training organization. Following the departure of Jan Leike, another AI safety researcher who also joined Anthropic, Schulman took over as head of OpenAI's alignment science efforts and was a member of the newly formed safety committee.\n\nDespite ongoing controversies surrounding OpenAI's approach to AI safety research, Schulman emphasized that his decision to leave was not due to a lack of support from the company. Instead, he framed it as a personal choice driven by his desire to focus his efforts on new research challenges at Anthropic.\n\nWith Schulman's exit, only three of OpenAI's 11 original founders remain: CEO Sam Altman, Brockman, and Wojciech Zaremba, who leads language and code generation.\n\nAltman expressed his gratitude and admiration for Schulman's contributions, describing him as a brilliant researcher, a deep thinker about product and society, and a great friend to the team.\n\nAs OpenAI continues to navigate these significant changes, the company's leadership and remaining founders face the challenge of maintaining momentum and ensuring the continuity of their ambitious AI research and development efforts.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthropic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AI alignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrical engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojciech_Zaremba", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wojciech Zaremba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Berkeley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science", "label": "dmoz/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Nanotechnology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Nanotechnology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Invention_and_Innovation", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Invention and Innovation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/08/Trouble-in-OpenAI-Co-founder-John-Schulman-leaves-for-Anthropic-Greg-Brockman-on-sabbatical-2024-08-fe777c4a333c92eac7c3b090a44bebc4-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793359", "eventUri": "eng-9793359", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.\n\nOpenAI experienced a significant shake-up as two co-founders, John Schulman and Greg Brockman, announced their departures a day after Elon Musk filed a new lawsuit against the company.\n\nOn Aug. 5, Musk filed a legal action accusing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Brockman of misleading him into co-founding the organization and straying from its original non-profit mission. The billionaire's lawsuit had attracted significant attention because he had withdrawn a similar application less than two months ago.\n\nHowever, less than 24 hours after the news, OpenAI faces an exodus of its top leadership, raising more questions about the company.\n\nBrockman, who served as the company's President, stated that he was taking an extended sabbatical until the end of the year. He emphasized the need to recharge after nine years with OpenAI, noting that the mission to develop safe artificial general intelligence (AGI) is ongoing.\n\nOn the other hand, Schulman said he was leaving the AI company for its rival, Anthropic because he wanted to focus more on AI alignment -- a field that ensures AI systems are beneficial and non-harmful to humans.\n\nHe added that another reason he left was because he wanted to engage in more hands-on technical work. Schulman wrote:\n\n\"I've decided to pursue this goal at Anthropic, where I believe I can gain new perspectives and do research alongside people deeply engaged with the topics I'm most interested in.\"\n\nSchulman's exit leaves the company with only two active co-founders, including CEO Altman, Brockman, and Wojciech Zaremba, who leads language and code generation.\n\nMeanwhile, Schulman's departure has reignited focus on OpenAI's AI safety practices. Critics argue that the company's emphasis on product development has overshadowed safety concerns. This criticism follows the disbandment of OpenAI's superalignment team, which was dedicated to controlling advanced AI systems.\n\nLast month, US lawmakers wrote Altman and sought confirmation on whether OpenAI will honor its pledge to allocate 20% of its computing resources to AI safety research.\n\nIn response, Altman reiterated the firm's commitment to allocating at least 20% of its computing resources to safety efforts and added:", "source": {"uri": "cryptoslate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoSlate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oluwapelumi_adejumo@cryptoslate.com", "name": "Oluwapelumi Adejumo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthropic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AI alignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojciech_Zaremba", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wojciech Zaremba"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/openai-exit.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793359", "eventUri": "eng-9793359", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 302, "textEnd": 308}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

The Information reports that Greg Brockman, who serves as the company's president and is one of the 11 cofounders, has initiated an extended leave. John Schulman, another cofounder and a key contributor, has transitioned to Anthropic, a company established by former OpenAI researchers. Furthermore, Peter Deng, a product leader with a history at firms like Meta Platforms, Uber, and Airtable, has also left the company.\n\nThese unannounced exits, while seemingly not interlinked, highlight the ongoing turbulence within OpenAI's leadership. This executive turnover follows the contentious firing and later reinstatement of CEO Sam Altman in November, which Brockman was also a part of. Brockman's sabbatical and Schulman's migration to a rival entity underscore the continuing instability at OpenAI.\n\nThe exits of Brockman and Schulman are particularly noteworthy due to their central roles at OpenAI. As president, Brockman has been a key player in guiding the company's strategic objectives. Schulman's switch to Anthropic, a competitor attracting former OpenAI talent, might impact OpenAI's competitive edge in the sector.\n\nPeter Deng's departure represents another shift in the company's product management hierarchy. Deng, who brought substantial expertise from his tenure at major tech organizations, was expected to significantly influence OpenAI's product progression. His exit raises questions about the continuity of OpenAI's product development strategies.\n\nThe shuffle also comes during a busy period for OpenAI.

Concurrently, John Schulman, a co-founder and key scientist, is leaving to join Anthropic, an emerging competitor.\n\nAnthropic, established in 2021 by former OpenAI staff, concentrates on AI safety and alignment. It has quickly become noteworthy, attracting significant investments, including from Amazon.\n\nThis startup strives to ensure AI systems operate in harmony with human values and intentions, a crucial field as AI technologies become increasingly integrated into daily life.\n\nJohn Schulman's departure is particularly consequential. As a pivotal figure in AI research, he led the reinforcement learning team that developed ChatGPT, OpenAI's popular chatbot.\n\nHis move signifies a deepened focus on AI safety, a critical area in which both OpenAI and Anthropic are deeply invested.\n\nThis wave of departures at OpenAI includes Peter Deng, a vice president, and several safety team members.\n\nStrategic Leadership Changes at OpenAI\n\nHowever, the organization is bolstering its ranks with strategic hires such as a new CFO and chief product officer, aiming to stabilize its leadership structure.\n\nWith Brockman and Schulman's exits, only two original co-founders remain at OpenAI: CEO Sam Altman and Wojciech Zaremba.\n\nThis change raises questions about the company's strategic continuity and its position in a fiercely competitive AI market.\n\nThe competitive landscape includes tech giants like Google and Meta, all advancing in generative AI technologies.\n\nAnthropic's unique emphasis on AI safety sets it apart, positioning it as a strong contender in this arena. These leadership changes at OpenAI underscore the dynamic nature of the AI industry.\n\nThey reflect the ongoing race to develop technologies that are not only advanced but also safe and aligned with ethical standards.\n\nThis evolution promises new breakthroughs and challenges in the field.

These exits follow other major resignations, including AI safety leader Aleksander Madry's reassignment and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever's departure in May.

This choice stems from my desire to deepen my focus on AI alignment, and to start a new chapter of my career where I can return to hands-on technical work. I've decided to pursue this goal at Anthropic, where I believe I can gain new perspectives and do research alongside people deeply engaged with the topics I'm most interested in. To be clear, I'm not leaving due to lack of support for alignment research at OpenAI. On the contrary, company leaders have been very committed to investing in this area. My decision is a personal one, based on how I want to focus my efforts in the next phase of my career.\n\nI joined OpenAI almost 9 years ago as part of the founding team after grad school. It's the first and only company where I've ever worked, other than an internship. It's also been quite a lot of fun. I'm grateful to Sam and Greg for recruiting me back at the beginning, and Mira and Bob for putting a lot of faith in me, bringing great opportunities and helping me successfully navigate various challenges. I'm proud of what we've all achieved together at OpenAI; building an unusual and unprecedented company with a public benefit mission.\n\nI am confident that OpenAI and the teams I was part of will continue to thrive without me. Post-training is in good hands and has a deep bench of amazing talent. I get too much credit for ChatGPT -- Barret has done an incredible job building the team into the incredibly competent operation it is now, with Liam, Luke, and others. I've been heartened to see the alignment team coming together with some promising projects. With leadership from Mia, Boaz and others, I believe the team is in very capable hands.\n\nI'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to participate in such an important part of history and I'm proud of what we've achieved together. I'll still be rooting for you all, even while working elsewhere.\n\nThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

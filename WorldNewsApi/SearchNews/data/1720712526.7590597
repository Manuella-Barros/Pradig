{"id": 232039138, "title": "Carlos Alcaraz v Alexander Zverev: French Open 2024 men\u2019s singles final \u2013 live", "text": "Salut tout le monde and bienvenue \u00e0 Roland-Garros 2024 \u2013 le finale hommes! 2004 feels like a long time ago \u2013 partly because the world has changed a lot since then, but mainly because, er \u2026 it is? Which makes it all the more mind-boggling that it was also the last time we had a French Open final that didn\u2019t include him, him or \u2013 award yourself the reward of your choice if you immediately thought yes of course, Gast\u00f3n Gaudio beat Guillermo Coria 8-6 in the fifth after losing the first two sets 0-6 3-6. And a further treat is all yours if you can recall that the following year, it was Mariano Puerta \u2013 yes that\u2019s the Mariano Puerta \u2013 losing to 19-year-old debutant Rafael Nadal. Now, though, we\u2019ve an entirely different set of dynastic hopefuls \u2013 the Alcaraz-Sinner semi felt like epochal change \u2013 two of whom will annihilate themselves for our delectation this afternoon. Alcaraz is one of the most compelling entertainers our sport has ever seen, a good vibes John McEnroe with joy and love wafting from every pore. But make no mistake: much as we\u2019d all love to cuddle him, he remains an absolute killer, his artist\u2019s imagination backed up by the exhibition viciousness of a ninja\u2019s forehand and and the certainty that when he needs to get it done, he can. Alexander Zverev, on the other hand, was lucky enough to face \u201conly\u201d Dominic Thiem in his only other major final and went up two sets \u2026 then lost in a fifth-set tiebreak. He\u2019s improved a lot since then, though, his first serve and backhand two of the best shots in the game, and retains unbelievable belief in his ability despite a dicky second serve and forehand. Alcaraz, though, is particularly brilliant with his forehand cross-court and forehand inside-in, shots perfect for attacking his opponent\u2019s weak wing, and if he keeps the head the likelihood is he gets it done. But no player boasting weapons as damaging as Zverev\u2019s can be discounted, so it\u2019s les yeux baiss\u00e9s for what could be the first of many classics.

And it couldn\u2019t have been worse. He stuttered and stumbled incoherently through his talking points, making himself look weaker and less capable than ever. \u201cJoe Biden \u2014 they were making him the best that he possibly could be tonight. They locked him away at Camp David for seven days; they were doing everything in their power to make sure that he was going to come out on the top of his game tonight, and this is what we got,\u201d says Jill Savage. \u201cObviously, President Biden lost his train of thought a number of times; he rambled; he was incoherent,\u201d adds BlazeTV contributor Delano Squires, adding that Trump surprised him in a good way. He \u201cwas energetic but disciplined,' and \u201ceven when President Biden froze that first time, [Trump] could have easily referenced Sleepy Joe or something like that, but he didn't.\u201d The debate moderators \u2014 CNN\u2019s Dana Bash and Jake Tapper \u2014 pleasantly surprised Squires as well. \u201cThey actually did what most people want journalists to do, which is to ask questions and let the other person ... respond,\u201d he tells Jill and Blaze Media editor in chief Matthew Peterson. \u201cThey didn't make themselves the stars of the show.\u201d For Peterson, \u201cwe have to emphasize Trump\u2019s discipline.\u201d \u201cHe showed a discipline that most people consider rare,\u201d he says, adding that at times, it seemed like Trump even \u201c[felt] bad for [Biden].\u201d But there\u2019s one thing that has Peterson angry about the debate.

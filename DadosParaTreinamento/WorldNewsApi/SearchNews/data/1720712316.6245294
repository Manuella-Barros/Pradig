Paul is set to face boxing legend Mike Tyson on November 15, with the fight getting rescheduled after Tyson suffered a health scare. KSI, meanwhile, is set to return to the ring on August 31 in a bizarre two vs one handicap match against Slim Albaher and Anthony Taylor. Slim is 7-0 as a boxer, while former MMA fighter Taylor has won his last two fights against King Kenny and Salt Papi. And in a video announcing his fight against Slim and Taylor, KSI once again called out Paul. \"I see that he has rescheduled his fight with Mike Tyson,\" the YouTube star said. \"So now Mike will be even older when he fights. Mike Tyson is a man who is in no condition to fight a 20-something-year-old at his age. \"I mean, Jake Paul and Netflix want to do what they want, so all good. But today I will be making my final offer. May 2025, it gives you all the time in the world to be ready and we can do it in America, just to make you that bit more happy. \"But that is that when it comes to giving you advantages. I mean first of all we agreed to fight at 180lbs and then you decided to run away and fight Nate Diaz instead. Then you came back and wanted a fight at 185lbs and then decided 200lbs. \"You know what Jake, I am tired of this b*******, get off the cycle and lets make this work. 185lbs is my final offer, take it or leave it.\" However, KSI's promoter Mams Taylor has since responded to a tweet from Paul's manager Nakisa Bidarian, stating the Brit would also be willing to fight him in February. \"For the record: Jake Paul current schedule\u2026 February is open. May is not,\" read a post from BAVAFA Sports, a company founded by Bidarian. In reponse, Taylor wrote: \"Ok February then.

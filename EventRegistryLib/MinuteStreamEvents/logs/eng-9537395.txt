It will be the NHS, our schools and our public services. It will be addressing the climate crisis.\"\n\nHe urged the SNP not to, \"let our disagreements dominate\" and told the audience, \"Join me as we open a new chapter. That's my job, that's our job, and I plan to get the job done.\"\n\nMr. Swinney accepted there would be \"controversy\" in the fact that he had been elected unopposed but he said it was perhaps a sign of the SNP, \"coming back together again.\"\n\nHe said, \"John Swinney was joined at the hip with the disgraced Nicola Sturgeon and his fingerprints are all over her numerous policy failures and cover-ups.\"\n\n\"With John Swinney at the helm, the SNP will double down on their independence obsession -- the one issue they agree on -- and ignore the real priorities of the Scottish people, such as fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy,\" he added.\n\nEarlier he posted a message on social media platform X saying: \"I am deeply honoured to have been elected as leader of the SNP. I will give all that I have to serve my party and my country.\"\n\nLater this week Mr. Swinney will now face a vote at Holyrood and if he wins he would be confirmed as Scotland's seventh first minister.\n\nThe first three -- Donald Dewar, Henry McLeish and Jack McConnell -- represented the Labour Party and the other four -- Mr. Salmond, Ms. Sturgeon, Mr. Yousaf and potentially Mr. Swinney -- were from the SNP.\n\nMr. Yousaf stepped down as SNP leader and Scotland's First Minister last week after pulling out of the Bute House agreement and then facing two votes of no confidence from both Labour and the Tories.\n\nAt the start of his speech on Monday, Mr. Swinney praised Mr. Yousaf' and said, \"In particular, his moral leadership on the issue of Gaza has been a light in these very dark times.\"\n\nMr. Yousaf in turn congratulated Mr. Swinney.\n\nWriting on X, Mr. Yousaf went on to say: \"John's central message has been one of unity. As a party, we must heed his call, whatever has happened in the past should remain there. Let's get behind John and his team so they can deliver for Scotland.\"\n\nBut Labour's leader in Scotland, Anas Sarwar, said: \"At a time when Scotland is crying out for change, the SNP is offering more of the same. John Swinney has been at the heart of this incompetent government for 17 years and at the heart of the SNP for 40 years.\"\n\n\"From presiding over the exam results scandal as education secretary to destroying public finances as finance secretary, John Swinney's record is one of failure,\" he added.\n\nThe next elections to the Scottish parliament are not until 2026.", "source": {"uri":

leadership front-runner John Swinney is expected to succeed Humza Yousaf unopposed after a potential challenger withdrew his bid at the 11th hour.\n\nEarlier on Sunday it emerged that veteran SNP activist Graeme McCormick, who has been openly critical of the Scottish government, had secured a nomination.\n\nHowever he announced later that although he had met the threshold of support needed to secure a nomination, he had decided not to proceed and would back Mr Swinney instead.\n\nThis came after a \"lengthy and fruitful conversation\" with Mr Swinney in which Mr McCormick said they had agreed the challenges which the SNP, the government and the people face.\n\nThis means Mr Swinney is expected to be elected leader of the SNP after nominations close at midday on Monday.\n\nMr Yousaf resigned after just over a year in the role following the fallout from the decision to terminate a power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens.\n\nLater that week Mr Swinney announced that he was putting his name forward as he gave a speech at an event in Edinburgh last week.\n\nMr Swinney, 60, previously led the SNP between 2000 and 2004 and said he would not be \"interim leader\" or a \"caretaker,\" adding he intended to see out a full term.\n\nOn Sunday he suggested that rebuilding the SNP could be delayed if another candidate were to enter the leadership race - though said he would engage with internal party democracy.\n\nHis preference, he said, was to \"get on with things\" as the party had not been as cohesive as it should have been in recent years.\n\nLeadership candidates are required to get 100 nominations from at least 20 local SNP branches before standing in the race.\n\nMr McCormick is a retired lawyer and stood against Mike Russell to become party president in 2023, losing by 599 votes to 79.\n\nHe previously argued for abolishing tax and replacing it with an annual rent on land, and that the route to Scottish independence lay through international treaties, with Scotland dissolving the union immediately if the SNP returned the most MPs in Scotland at a general election.\n\nIn a speech at the party conference in October last year, he described the SNP government as being like \"flatulence in a trance.\"\n\nLate on Sunday, Mr McCormick released a statement saying he and Mr Swinney had \"explored new thinking on a range of issues\" that would \"inspire activists\" within the SNP and in the wider independence movement.\n\nConfirming he was backing Mr Swinney, he said: \"This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians, and I'm sure that John's determination to deliver Independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.\"\n\nEarlier this week former SNP leadership candidate Kate Forbes confirmed she was not standing and backed Mr Swinney, having been promised a \"significant\" cabinet role if he becomes first minister.\n\nIf no other candidate meets the nomination deadline, Mr Swinney would be free to seek parliamentary approval to become first minister.\n\nMr Yousaf has decided to stay on in the role until a replacement is selected.\n\nOnce his resignation has been accepted by the King, parliament has 28 days to select a replacement.\n\nThere will then be a vote in the chamber to decide the new first minister, which is passed by a simple majority.\n\nThe SNP has 63 seats in the parliament, which means it does not have a majority, but the vote is likely to pass regardless.\n\nThe parliament's presiding officer then recommends to the King that the winner be appointed as the new first minister.\n\nA swearing in ceremony at the Court of Session in Edinburgh could take place as early as Wednesday.\n\nAt that point, Mr Swinney would officially become first minister.\n\nMr Yousaf announced his intention to step down from the role last Monday.\n\nHe had ended the Bute House Agreement with the Scottish Greens, leaving him short of support for the minority SNP government at Holyrood.\n\nHe would have faced two votes of no confidence in his leadership last week had he not stood down.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives dropped their motion after his departure was confirmed, while Scottish Labour's - which was a vote of confidence in the entire government - was defeated with backing from the Greens.\n\nHis resignation came 13 months after defeating Ms Forbes and Ash Regan, who has since defected to the Alba Party, in the race to replace Nicola Sturgeon.\n\nHe became the first ethnic minority leader of a devolved government in the UK and the first Muslim to lead a major UK party.\n\nIn his resignation speech, he said he had \"clearly underestimated\" the hurt he had caused the Greens by ending the agreement and said his replacement would be tasked with \"repairing our relationship across the political divide\".", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This process is repeated until there are only two candidates left.\n\nAt this point, Mr Swinney only has to win more votes than his last opponent.\n\nThe SNP has 63 seats in the parliament - which is short of a majority. However, Mr Swinney is still expected to win the nomination.\n\nHolyrood's presiding officer recommends to the King that the winner is appointed as first minister.\n\nA swearing-in ceremony at the Court of Session in Edinburgh could take place as early as Wednesday.\n\nIn response the SNP leadership confirmation, Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said: \"As the main opposition party, we will hold John Swinney to account when he lets the Scottish people down - just as we've done with Humza Yousaf.\"\n\nPatrick Harvie, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, said: \"Mr Swinney knows that if he is to have our support then it must be on the basis of progressive policies that help us to tackle the climate crisis and build a fairer and more equal future.\"\n\nEarlier, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar posted on X: \"The return of John Swinney is about putting the interests of the SNP before Scotland - only Scottish Labour can deliver the change Scotland needs.\"\n\nMr Yousaf's premiership imploded last week after he ripped up the government's power-sharing Bute House Agreement with the Scottish Greens.\n\nThat left the SNP administration with a minority in parliament.\n\nFacing motions of no confidence in him and his government, Mr Yousaf confirmed he was standing down last Monday.\n\nIn his resignation speech, he said he had \"clearly underestimated\" the hurt he had caused the Greens by ending the agreement and said his replacement would be tasked with \"repairing our relationship across the political divide\".", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Yousaf", "body": "John Swinney is to become the new SNP leader on Monday after he persuaded an activist who threatened to derail his coronation to abandon his leadership bid.\n\nGraeme McCormick, a long-standing SNP member, had threatened to plunge the SNP into a costly and divisive leadership contest after he claimed he had secured enough support to force a leadership election.\n\nHowever, he revealed on Sunday night that he had held \"lengthy and fruitful talks\" with Mr Swinney and had decided to support his candidacy instead.\n\nIt means Mr Swinney is expected to be the only candidate for SNP leader when nominations close at midday on Monday, and is set to become the new first minister on Tuesday.\n\nWhile Mr Swinney would have been certain to win any leadership election, a contest would have prolonged Humza Yousaf's disastrous tenure until the end of the month and cost the cast-strapped SNP tens of thousands of pounds in an election year.\n\nMr McCormick, who was seen collecting nominations at an independence march in Glasgow on Saturday, said he had met the threshold to stand in the contest.\n\nUnder SNP rules, only 100 nominations are needed from 20 separate branches to make it onto the ballot.\n\nSenior SNP sources were nervous on Sunday that Mr McCormick would ruin the party's hopes to quickly move on from Mr Yousaf.\n\nHowever, he agreed to stand down following discussions with Mr Swinney, after apparently being convinced by Nicola Sturgeon's former deputy that he would push strongly for independence.\n\n\"I'd also like to put on record my thanks to John Swinney MSP with whom I had a lengthy and fruitful conversation,\" he added.\n\n\"John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP, our Government and our people face, and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident, as they are advanced, will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months.\n\n\"This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians, and I'm sure that John's determination to deliver independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.\n\n\"I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney's nomination for party leader and first minister of Scotland\".\n\nMr Swinney and his allies believed they had all but secured the SNP leadership when Kate Forbes, his only viable challenger, announced she would not be standing on Thursday, hours after he promised her a top government job at his campaign launch.\n\nMs Forbes also decided not to run after one-on-one talks with Mr Swinney, who has received a string of high-profile endorsements from senior party figures.\n\nHowever, Mr McCormick, a retired lawyer who has regularly criticised SNP strategy, indicated on Saturday as he attempted to find supporters at an independence march in Glasgow, that he believed he would make the ballot.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr Swinney issued a thinly-veiled public plea for Mr McCormick to stand down, a call echoed by other senior party figures.\n\nGavin Newlands, an SNP MP, branded Mr McCormick's leadership bid a \"self-indulgent waste of time which is being egged-on by folk from other parties and seized on by the media with great glee.\"\n\nPete Wishart, the SNP's longest serving MP, warned party members that unionists, members of Alex's Salmond's Alba Party and the media were \"cheering on\" a leadership contest.\n\nThe internal election could have embarrassed the SNP, as Mr McCormick holds radical positions and would temporarily have been handed a national platform.\n\nAt last year's SNP conference he branded the party's independence police \"flatulence in a trance\" and he has argued devolved taxation powers could be used to pay for universal free energy for Scots.\n\nAt an SNP independence convention last summer, he claimed that should Scots back the party manifesto at an election, its MPs should \"walk out of Westminster, declare the dissolution of the Union and set up a provisional government in Edinburgh\".\n\nMr Swinney had earlier told Sky News: \"I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we have had.\n\n\"Bluntly, I'd just like to get on with that as quickly as I possibly can, because every day that we spend in an internal contest, which I think we all probably know the outcome of, we delay the ability for the SNP to start its rebuilding.\"", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Advertisement\n\nAn SNP 'lifer' - he joined the party at the age of 15 - Mr Swinney was a management consultant and life assurance industry executive before becoming MP for Tayside North in 1997.\n\nTwo years later, he was among the first intake of MSPs at Holyrood.\n\nAn early reputation for competence was shattered when Mr Swinney succeeded Alex Salmond as party leader in 2000.\n\nFor four years, he was undermined by rivals within the SNP and, unable to stamp his authority on the party, Mr Swinney suffered a series of bruising election results.\n\nWhen the SNP fared poorly in the 2004 Euro elections, a visit from the men in grey kilts brought his leadership to an end.\n\nJohn Swinney speaks as he launches his SNP leadership bid on May 02, 2024 in Edinburgh\n\nFearful the subsequent leadership contest might be won by someone from the SNP's radical wing, Mr Salmond returned as leader, going on to become Scotland's first nationalist First Minister in 2007.\n\nMr Swinney's authority across the party grew during the SNP's time in power.\n\nHe was a member of the tiny clique - including Mr Salmond and his deputy, Nicola Sturgeon - that ran the SNP with an iron fist.\n\nAnnouncing his candidacy to replace Mr Yousaf, who resigned in advance of a confidence vote he hadn't the numbers to win, Mr Swinney said he had come forward because of the need for change.\n\nJohn Swinney is crowned as SNP leader - and is set to become Scotland's new First Minister - after party dodges divisive leadership contest in wake of Humza Yousaf's meltdown Advertisement\n\nHis party had to change and if it didn't, there would be tougher times to come.\n\nScottish voters may be sceptical about Mr Swinney's ability to change the direction in which his party has been travelling.\n\nWhen Ms Sturgeon succeeded Mr Salmond as First Minister after defeat for the nationalists in the 2014 independence referendum, she appointed Mr Swinney her deputy.\n\nFor the next nine years, the pair were politically inseparable as the SNP pursued a raft of policies that were out of kilter with the priorities of voters.\n\nMr Swinney was right by Ms Sturgeon's side as she fomented deeper division with endless promises of a second referendum she had no power to deliver.\n\nAnd he was one of the key architects of the Bute House Agreement that brought the Scottish Greens into power and saw them pressure SNP ministers to push ahead with a law that gave trans people the right to self-identify.\n\nAs it came into conflict with the UK-wide Equality Act, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack was compelled to block it, a move that proved to be the beginning of the end for Ms Sturgeon.\n\nMr Swinney stepped down as Deputy First Minister when Ms Sturgeon resigned last year.\n\nSNP members now see John Swinney as their saviour but the harsh reality is that he was right behind every government misstep that helped bring his party to its knees.\n\nHe is the very definition of 'yesterday's man'.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Swinney is crowned as SNP leader to replace Humza Yousaf", "body": "John Swinney has been crowned the new SNP leader today after nominations in the party's contest to replace Humza Yousaf closed without him being challenged.\n\nIt was announced shortly after the midday deadline that Mr Swinney had ran unopposed after SNP figures moved to dodge another divisive leadership battle.\n\nFollowing his confirmation as the SNP's new leader, Mr Swinney is now likely to become Scotland's next first minister - replacing Mr Yousaf - in the coming days.\n\nHe will face a vote at Holyrood later this week, where it is likely he will become the Scottish Parliament's nominated candidate to be the country's seventh first minister.\n\nParty activist Graeme McCormick yesterday said he had secured the 100 nominations from 20 SNP branches needed to run against Mr Swinney.\n\nBut he later confirmed he had backed out of a leadership challenge after 'lengthy and fruitful' conversations with Mr Swinney.\n\nMr Swinney had earlier warned that a full-blown contest could damage the party's chances of recovering from a 'difficult' period.\n\nJohn Swinney is set to be crowned the new SNP leader today when nominations in the party's contest to replace Humza Yousaf close at noon\n\nThe SNP were forced to look for a third new leader in little more than a year after Mr Yousaf, who replaced Nicola Sturgeon in March 2023, announced his resignation last Monday\n\nKeith Brown, the SNP's depute leader, this morning said the 'field is clearing' ahead of Mr Swinney's expected coronation.\n\n'It seems to be that the field is cleaning somewhat and it looks like John Swinney might be the sole nominee,' he told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland.\n\nMr Brown described Mr Swinney as the 'biggest hitter in the SNP' who would scare unionist parties 'to a great extent'.\n\nThe SNP were forced to look for a third new leader in little more than a year after Mr Yousaf, who replaced Nicola Sturgeon in March 2023, announced his resignation last Monday.\n\nIt came after the outgoing First Minister prompted a meltdown at Holyrood by terminating the SNP's power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens.\n\nThis blew up in Mr Yousaf's face when the Greens then turned against him and vowed to vote in favour of him being ousted from Bute House.\n\nMr Yousaf subsequently quit in order to avoid the embarrassment of losing a no confidence vote.\n\nKate Forbes, the former Scottish finance secretary who came second to Mr Yousaf in last year's SNP leadership race, had been expected to run again.\n\nBut she last week confirmed she would not run against Mr Swinney, who heaped praise on her and said she would be offered a 'significant' job in his team.\n\nThe Scottish Government Cabinet will meet on Tuesday, with MSPs later given the opportunity to elect a new first minister at some point in the Holyrood schedule.\n\nMr Swinney would then have to swear three oaths of office at the Court of Session in Edinburgh before officially becoming first minister.\n\nThe 60-year-old served as Ms Sturgeon's deputy first minister for almost nine years.\n\nThe Perthshire North MSP was also SNP leader between 2000 and 2004, standing down after a poor showing at the European elections.\n\nWhen he decided not to stand for the leadership last year he said it was time for a new generation to

on Sunday it emerged that veteran SNP activist Graeme McCormick, who has been openly critical of the Scottish government, had secured a nomination.\n\nHowever he announced later that although he had met the threshold of support needed to secure a nomination, he had decided not to proceed and would back Mr Swinney instead.\n\nThis came after a \"lengthy and fruitful conversation\" with Mr Swinney in which Mr McCormick said they had agreed the challenges which the SNP, the government and the people face.\n\nThis means Mr Swinney is expected to be elected leader of the SNP after nominations close at midday on Monday.\n\nMr Yousaf resigned after just over a year in the role following the fallout from the decision to terminate a power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens.\n\nLater that week Mr Swinney announced that he was putting his name forward as he gave a speech at an event in Edinburgh last week.\n\nMr Swinney, 60, previously led the SNP between 2000 and 2004 and said he would not be \"interim leader\" or a \"caretaker,\" adding he intended to see out a full term.\n\nOn Sunday he suggested that rebuilding the SNP could be delayed if another candidate were to enter the leadership race - though said he would engage with internal party democracy.\n\nHis preference, he said, was to \"get on with things\" as the party had not been as cohesive as it should have been in recent years.\n\nLeadership candidates are required to get 100 nominations from at least 20 local SNP branches before standing in the race.\n\nMr McCormick is a retired lawyer and stood against Mike Russell to become party president in 2023, losing by 599 votes to 79.\n\nHe previously argued for abolishing tax and replacing it with an annual rent on land, and that the route to Scottish independence lay through international treaties, with Scotland dissolving the union immediately if the SNP returned the most MPs in Scotland at a general election.\n\nIn a speech at the party conference in October last year, he described the SNP government as being like \"flatulence in a trance.\"\n\nLate on Sunday, Mr McCormick released a statement saying he and Mr Swinney had \"explored new thinking on a range of issues\" that would \"inspire activists\" within the SNP and in the wider independence movement.\n\nConfirming he was backing Mr Swinney, he said: \"This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians, and I'm sure that John's determination to deliver Independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.\"\n\nEarlier this week former SNP leadership candidate Kate Forbes confirmed she was not standing and backed Mr Swinney, having been promised a \"significant\" cabinet role if he becomes first minister.\n\nIf no other candidate meets the nomination deadline, Mr Swinney would be free to seek parliamentary approval to become first minister.\n\nMr Yousaf has decided to stay on in the role until a replacement is selected.\n\nOnce his resignation has been accepted by the King, parliament has 28 days to select a replacement.\n\nThere will then be a vote in the chamber to decide the new first minister, which is passed by a simple majority.\n\nThe SNP has 63 seats in the parliament, which means it does not have a majority, but the vote is likely to pass regardless.\n\nThe parliament's presiding officer then recommends to the King that the winner be appointed as the new first minister.\n\nA swearing in ceremony at the Court of Session in Edinburgh could take place as early as Wednesday.\n\nAt that point, Mr Swinney would officially become first minister.\n\nMr Yousaf announced his intention to step down from the role last Monday.\n\nHe had ended the Bute House Agreement with the Scottish Greens, leaving him short of support for the minority SNP government at Holyrood.\n\nHe would have faced two votes of no confidence in his leadership last week had he not stood down.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives dropped their motion after his departure was confirmed, while Scottish Labour's - which was a vote of confidence in the entire government - was defeated with backing from the Greens.\n\nHis resignation came 13 months after defeating Ms Forbes and Ash Regan, who has since defected to the Alba Party, in the race to replace Nicola Sturgeon.\n\nHe became the first ethnic minority leader of a devolved government in the UK and the first Muslim to lead a major UK party.\n\nIn his resignation speech, he said he had \"clearly underestimated\" the hurt he had caused the Greens by ending the agreement and said his replacement would be tasked with \"repairing our relationship across the political divide\".", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I'm ready for what lies ahead'", "body": "He told The Herald: \"I was just going 100 miles an hour all the time. And when I stopped I became aware how physically and mentally exhausted I was.\n\n\"Although I have worked hard [over the last year] I've been doing different things, so today I'm now physically and mentally rested. I'm ready for what lies ahead.\n\n\"I hope I'm being clear to you today, how much of a privilege and an honour it is to be asked to be leader of my party and to hopefully be elected as First Minister of Scotland.\"\n\n\"That inspiration and opportunity will fuel me through the challenges that lie ahead,\" he added.\n\nREAD MORE: John Swinney confirmed as new SNP leader\n\nMr Swinney could become First Minister within days, with Humza Yousaf expected to tender his resignation to the King on Tuesday morning.\n\nThat would trigger a nomination process in Holyrood and, if the Parliamentary Bureau agrees, a vote as tomorrow afternoon.\n\nScottish Tory leader Douglas Ross, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and Scottish Lib Dem Leader Alex Cole-Hamilton have all confirmed that they too will stand in the vote.\n\nAs the SNP does not have a majority, Mr Swinney will need some opposition MSPs to either back him or abstain.\n\nDuring his acceptance speech at Glasgow University's Advanced Research Centre, the former deputy first minister, who is now set to lead a minority government, said he was keen to work cross-party and \"seek to find common ground\" and \"join together in coalitions of the willing and solve the problems our country faces\".\n\nMr Swinney, who has long been one of the Holyrood debating chamber's most prolific hecklers, admitted that he had personally contributed to the polarisation in politics.\n\n\"I've obviously contributed to that. Of course, I have.\"\n\nHe said politics was \"in the worst state I've ever seen it.\"\n\n\"So I'm here to do something about that, to change that so we can have an open and honest and respectful dialogue in Scotland about what the future holds for us, what the future should be.\n\n\"And I'm very clear what I think the future should be I'm also equally clear I won't get that by shouting at people. I'll get that by persuading people.\n\n\"That's what I'm committing myself to.\"\n\nMr Swinney acknowledged there was \"controversy\" over the fact he was the only candidate for the role.\n\nInitially, it looked as if Kate Forbes could enter the contest but she withdrew last week, offering her support to Mr Swinney.\n\nOver the weekend, it looked as if he could face a grassroots challenge when Graeme McCormick, a prominent activist gathered enough nominations to enter the race.\n\nHe later pulled out after a \"fruitful and lengthy\" conversation with Mr Swinney.\n\nThe SNP leader told the audience of MPs, MSPs, councillors, activists, journalists and Scottish Government officials that this was a sign his party - which had been through a \"rough time recently\" - was \"coming back together again.\"\n\nHe went on to say that his leadership was the \"beginning of a new chapter in our party's history.\"\n\nHe pledged to create an \"inclusive and unified team\" and to enable \"open and respectful dialogue in the SNP\", and said he would ensure the SNP looks outward to the people of Scotland.\n\nREAD MORE: Swinney pays tribute to Yousaf in his first speech as new SNP leader\n\nThe presumptive first minister said his focus would be on \"the economy, jobs, the cost of living.\"\n\n\"It will be the National Health Service, our schools and our public services. It will be addressing the climate crisis,\" he added.\n\nHe said he would \"seek, with respect and courtesy, to persuade people of the case for independence\".\n\nBut in a direct message to the other Holyrood parties, he said their opposition to leaving the UK was not a reason not to work with him on other policy areas.\n\nAsked what his one big policy idea was, Mr Swinney said he was \"determined\" to \"eradicate child poverty in Scotland.\"\n\n\"I will start focusing the government on maximising what we can do within our powers to eradicate child poverty. It is a curse.\"\n\nMr Swinney categorically ruled out another Bute House Agreement type deal with the Scottish Greens and hinted that he could yet ditch some of the policies brought forward as part of the powersharing agreement.\n\nThe comment came after Patrick Harvie warned the soon-to-be leader of the Scottish Government against \"diluting\" policies including the conversion therapy ban, rent control and the decarbonisation of heating in homes.\n\n\"We'll take it on an issue-by-issue basis,\" Mr Swinney said. \"Which means that on some issues, I'm sure we will be aligned with the Scottish Green Party. But I'm sure on other issues we'll have to find support and an agreement with other political parties.\"\n\nMr Swinney refused to be drawn on tax plans but said he agreed with Kate Forbes that the government cannot \"continually\" keep on increasing taxation.\n\nHe said there were \"sensitive judgments\" to be made.\n\n\"You've got to make the right tax judgments in the right context and the right circumstances and that's what I think the Scottish Government has done.\"\n\nHe said that people \"who are on higher incomes are able to make more of a contribution to the public finance so we can lower the burden for those on lower ends of the spectrum, but that everybody benefits from the social contract that we make available to people in Scotland.\"\n\nAt the start of his speech, he paid tribute to his predecessor, insisting Humza Yousaf would \"continue to make a substantial contribution to the public life of Scotland.\"\n\nEarlier, Mr Yousaf had congratulated his successor, as he urged SNP members to \"get behind John and his team so they can deliver for Scotland\".\n\nREAD MORE: Greens warn new SNP leader against 'diluting' conversion therapy ban\n\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross was scathing about Mr Swinney's victory in the contest, describing him as the \"ultimate continuity candidate.\"\n\nHe said: \"John Swinney was joined at the hip with the disgraced Nicola Sturgeon and his fingerprints are all over her numerous policy failures and cover-ups.\"\n\nThe Tory added: \"With John Swinney at the helm, the SNP will double down on their independence obsession - the one issue they agree on - and ignore the real priorities of the Scottish people, such as fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy.\"\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar repeated his call for an election: \"At a time when Scotland is crying out for change, the SNP is offering more of the same.\n\n\"John Swinney has been at the heart of this incompetent government for 17 years and at the heart of the SNP for 40 years.\n\n\"From presiding over the exam results scandal as education secretary to destroying public finances as finance secretary, John Swinney's record is one of failure.\"\n\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton agreed. He said: \"As his party's leader and a former wingman to both Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon, John Swinney is now answerable for the SNP's appalling neglect of public services over the past 17 years.\n\n\"He should immediately announce a plan for cutting NHS waiting lists and stopping sewage flowing into our rivers and if he can't do that he should announce an election.\"", "source":

Police later launched an investigation which has seen Ms Sturgeon, who denies wrongdoing, arrested and released without charge.\n\nShe remains under investigation, along with Colin Beattle, the former party treasurer, who was also arrested last year and released without charge.\n\nMs Sturgeon's husband, Peter Murrell, the former SNP chief executive, was last month charged with embezzlement of funds from the party.\n\nMr Swinney is likely to become Scotland's next first minister, the third in just over a year, as early as Tuesday.\n\nThe Scottish Government Cabinet will also meet on Tuesday, with MSPs later given the opportunity to elect a new first minister at some point in the Holyrood schedule.\n\nMr Swinney would then have to swear three oaths of office at the Court of Session in Edinburgh before officially becoming First Minister.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_sanderson@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name":

It will be the National Health Service, our schools and our public services. It will be addressing the climate crisis.\"\n\nHe said he would \"seek, with respect and courtesy, to persuade people of the case for independence\".\n\nBut he insisted that rival parties' opposition to this was \"not a reason for them to refuse to work with us to build the economy, support jobs and improve the health service\".\n\nHis appointment as SNP leader for a second time, having held the post between 2000 and 2004, comes exactly a week after Mr Yousaf's resignation.\n\nAt the start of his speech at Glasgow University on Monday, Mr Swinney paid tribute to his predecessor, hailing Mr Yousaf's \"moral leadership on the issue of Gaza\", adding he would \"continue to make a substantial contribution to the public life of Scotland\".\n\nBut he said his appointment to the post of SNP leader was \"the beginning of a new chapter\" for the party.\n\nWhile he said the SNP has \"faced a rough time recently as a party\" he insisted the fact that he was the only candidate to be the next leader \"demonstrates the Scottish National Party is now coming back together again now\".\n\nHe insisted he wanted to \"create a modern, diverse, dynamic Scotland\" as he added that the \"polarisation of politics does not serve our country well\".\n\nMr Swinney stated: \"Too often, too many people are too busy fighting to win battles when we should be seeking solutions to problems.\"\n\nHe continued: \"We need to stop shouting at each other and talk to each other. More than that, actually, we need to listen.\n\n\"And as first minister, I will do exactly that.\"\n\nMr Yousaf meanwhile congratulated his successor, as he urged SNP members to \"get behind John and his team so they can deliver for Scotland\".\n\nBut speaking about Mr Swinney, the Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: \"It's difficult to see how he can be the fresh start Scotland needs, when he's the ultimate continuity candidate.\n\n\"John Swinney was joined at the hip with the disgraced Nicola Sturgeon and his fingerprints are all over her numerous policy failures and cover-ups.\"\n\nThe Tory added: \"With John Swinney at the helm, the SNP will double down on their independence obsession - the one issue they agree on - and ignore the real priorities of the Scottish people, such as fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar hit out: \"At a time when Scotland is crying out for change, the SNP is offering more of the same.\n\n\"John Swinney has been at the heart of this incompetent government for 17 years and at the heart of the SNP for 40 years.\n\n\"From presiding over the exam results scandal as education secretary to destroying public finances as finance secretary, John Swinney's record is one of failure.\"\n\nSimilarly, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said: \"As his party's leader and a former wingman to both Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon, John Swinney is now answerable for the SNP's appalling neglect of public services over the past 17 years.\n\n\"He should immediately announce a plan for cutting NHS waiting lists and stopping sewage flowing into our rivers and if he can't do that he should announce an election.\"", "source": {"uri":

expected that Mr Swinney will run unopposed as SNP figures attempt to dodge another divisive leadership battle.\n\nIf he is confirmed as the SNP's new leader, Mr Swinney is then likely to become Scotland's next first minister - replacing Mr Yousaf - as early as tomorrow.\n\nParty activist Graeme McCormick yesterday said he had secured the 100 nominations from 20 SNP branches needed to run against Mr Swinney.\n\nBut he later confirmed he had backed out of a leadership challenge after 'lengthy and fruitful' conversations with Mr Swinney.\n\nMr Swinney had earlier warned that a full-blown contest could damage the party's chances of recovering from a 'difficult' period.\n\nJohn Swinney is set to be crowned the new SNP leader today when nominations in the party's contest to replace Humza Yousaf close at noon\n\nThe SNP were forced to look for a third new leader in little more than a year after Mr Yousaf, who replaced Nicola Sturgeon in March 2023, announced his resignation last Monday\n\nKeith Brown, the SNP's depute leader, this morning said the 'field is clearing' ahead of Mr Swinney's expected coronation.\n\n'It seems to be that the field is cleaning somewhat and it looks like John Swinney might be the sole nominee,' he told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland.\n\nMr Brown described Mr Swinney as the 'biggest hitter in the SNP' who would scare unionist parties 'to a great extent'.\n\nThe SNP were forced to look for a third new leader in little more than a year after Mr Yousaf, who replaced Nicola Sturgeon in March 2023, announced his resignation last Monday.\n\nIt came after the outgoing First Minister prompted a meltdown at Holyrood by terminating the SNP's power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens.\n\nThis blew up in Mr Yousaf's face when the Greens then turned against him and vowed to vote in favour of him being ousted from Bute House.\n\nMr Yousaf subsequently quit in order to avoid the embarrassment of losing a no confidence vote.\n\nKate Forbes, the former Scottish finance secretary who came second to Mr Yousaf in last year's SNP leadership race, had been expected to run again.\n\nBut she last week confirmed she would not run against Mr Swinney, who heaped praise on her and said she would be offered a 'significant' job in his team.\n\nThe Scottish Government Cabinet will meet on Tuesday, with MSPs later given the opportunity to elect a new first minister at some point in the Holyrood schedule.\n\nMr Swinney would then have to swear three oaths of office at the Court of Session in Edinburgh before officially becoming first minister.\n\nThe 60-year-old served as Ms Sturgeon's deputy first minister for almost nine years.\n\nThe Perthshire North MSP was also SNP leader between 2000 and 2004, standing down after a poor showing at the European elections.\n\nWhen he decided not to stand for the leadership last year he said it was time for a new generation to take over.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

As a party, we must heed his call, whatever has happened in the past should remain there.\n\n\"Let's get behind John & his team so they can deliver for Scotland.\"\n\nIt is the second time that Mr Swinney has taken on the leadership of his party, having previously held the job from 2000 to 2004.\n\nBut then he was leader of the main opposition party at Holyrood, with a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition in charge.\n\nNow, after holding a variety of senior posts in the Scottish Government, including finance secretary, education secretary and deputy first minister, a position he held for eight years under Nicola Sturgeon, he will get his first chance to be first minister.\n\nConfirmation of Mr Swinney's appointment as party leader comes 25 years to the day after the first elections to the Scottish Parliament with Mr Swinney one of only three MSPs to have held the same seat at Holyrood continuously since then.\n\nWhile Mr Yousaf's downfall was sparked by his decision to terminate the powersharing deal the SNP had had with the Scottish Greens, the smaller pro-independence party urged Mr Swinney not to ditch the \"progressive\" agenda that had been enshrined as part of that arrangement.\n\nScottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie said the party's seven MSPs would meet to discuss how they would vote in the ballot for first minister.\n\nMr Harvie stated: \"We are committed to delivering on our vision of a fairer, greener and more equal Scotland, and are open to talks with John Swinney and his team about how we can work together to make that happen.\"\n\nHe added: \"Scotland needs a period of stable government.\n\n\"Mr Swinney knows that if he is to have our support then it must be on the basis of progressive policies that help us to tackle the climate crisis and build a fairer and more equal future.\"\n\nThe Green MSP added: \"There are a lot of important policies already on their way to delivery as a result of the Bute House Agreement, including better rights for tenants and rent controls, transforming the way we heat our homes and a watertight ban on conversion therapy.\n\n\"We remain utterly committed to these policies and will oppose any move away from them or steps to dilute them.\"\n\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross meanwhile urged Mr Swinney to \"govern for all of Scotland by abandoning his relentless push for independence\".\n\nMr Ross insisted his party would seek to \"hold John Swinney to account when he lets the Scottish people down - just as we've done with Humza Yousaf\".\n\nBut the Conservative added: \"It's difficult to see how he can be the fresh start Scotland needs, when he's the ultimate continuity candidate.\n\n\"John Swinney was joined at the hip with the disgraced Nicola Sturgeon and his fingerprints are all over her numerous policy failures and cover-ups.\"\n\nWith Mr Swinney having led the SNP previously between 2000 and 2004, Mr Ross went on to question if a \"failed former leader from two decades ago - who, as education secretary, sent Scotland plummeting down international league tables\" was the best person to lead the country.\n\nHe claimed: \"With John Swinney at the helm, the SNP will double down on their independence obsession, the one issue they agree on, and ignore the real priorities of the Scottish people, such as fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy.\"\n\nMeanwhile Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said \"John Swinney's coronation is entirely about managing the SNP rather than running our country and delivering for Scotland.\n\n\"At a time when Scotland is crying out for change, the SNP is offering more of the same.\n\n\"John Swinney has been at the heart of this incompetent government for 17 years and at the

Police later launched an investigation which has seen Ms Sturgeon, who denies wrongdoing, arrested and released without charge.\n\nShe remains under investigation, along with Colin Beattle, the former party treasurer, who was also arrested last year and released without charge.\n\nMs Sturgeon's husband, Peter Murrell, the former SNP chief executive, was last month charged with embezzlement of funds from the party.\n\nMr Swinney is likely to become Scotland's next first minister, the third in just over a year, as early as Tuesday.\n\nThe Scottish Government Cabinet will also meet on Tuesday, with MSPs later given the opportunity to elect a new first minister at some point in the Holyrood schedule.\n\nMr Swinney would then have to swear three oaths of office at the Court of Session in Edinburgh before officially becoming First Minister.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Scottish Labour described him as \"yesterday's man\".\n\nSwinney has been keen to shed that image.\n\nAt his campaign launch in Edinburgh, he signalled that the party under him would return to a more centrist position focusing on \"economic growth and social justice\".\n\nThat comes after Sturgeon's deal with the Greens and a number of contentious policies such as gender reforms, the deposit return scheme and higher taxes on middle and higher earners.\n\nHe also offered an olive branch to Kate Forbes - considered to be on the right of the party - and has seemingly won over MPs such as Joanna Cherry, who has been critical of the party's social policies under Sturgeon and Yousaf.\n\nSwinney said Forbes would play a \"significant role\" in his government.\n\nLater, Forbes said she would not run and offered a full-hearted endorsement of Swinney.\n\nIt means Swinney has won support from several different wings of the SNP.\n\n\"I want to build on the work of the SNP government to create a modern, diverse, dynamic Scotland that will ensure opportunity for all of her citizens,\" he said at his SNP leadership launch on Thursday.\n\n\"I want to unite the SNP and unite Scotland for independence.\"\n\nHe added: \"Only the SNP stand where the majority of people want their government to be, in the moderate centre left of Scottish politics.\n\n\"That is where I stand and if elected by my party and by parliament my goals as First Minister will come straight from that centre-left tradition - the pursuit of economic growth and social justice.\"\n\nFor opposition parties, Swinney will always be tied to records of Alex Salmond - he was his finance secretary for his whole premiership - and Sturgeon - he was her deputy first minster throughout her entire nine years as leader.\n\nWhose directions he chooses to follow - or none - is a choice he has yet to make.", "source": {"uri": "news.stv.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "STV News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

SNP leader", "body": "Former Scottish deputy first minister John Swinney said he was \"deeply honoured\" to have become the new leader of the SNP.\n\nMr Swinney reacted on social media after the party confirmed he was the only candidate to succeed Humza Yousaf, who announced one week ago he was stepping down as SNP leader and Scottish First Minister.\n\nMr Swinney is now expected to go on to become Scotland's seventh first minister, though before he does he will need to win the backing of MSPs in a vote at Holyrood.\n\nThat ballot could take place as early as Wednesday, with Mr Swinney likely to be officially in place in the top job in Scottish politics the following day.\n\nCommenting after it was confirmed he was the only candidate, Mr Swinney posted on X, formerly known as Twitter that he was \"deeply honoured to have been elected as Leader of @theSNP\".\n\nHe pledged: \"I will give all that I have to serve my party and my country.\"\n\nMr Yousaf's tenure as first minister came to an end after he tore up the powersharing agreement the party had enjoyed with the Scottish Greens at Holyrood, which left him facing a vote of no confidence in his leadership.\n\nThat means Mr Swinney will have to lead a minority government at Holyrood, requiring support from other parties before vital legislation can proceed.\n\nIt is the second time that Mr Swinney has taken on the leadership of his party, having previously held the job from 2000 to 2004.\n\nBut then he was leader of the main opposition party at Holyrood, with a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition in charge.\n\nNow, after holding a variety of senior posts in the Scottish Government, including finance secretary, education secretary and deputy first minister, a position he held for eight years under Nicola Sturgeon, he will get his first chance to be first minister.\n\nConfirmation of Mr Swinney's appointment as party leader comes 25 years to the day after the first elections to the Scottish Parliament with Mr Swinney one of only three MSPs to have held the same seat at Holyrood continuously since then.\n\nWhile Mr Yousaf's downfall was sparked by his decision to terminate the powersharing deal the SNP had had with the Scottish Greens, the smaller pro-independence party urged Mr Swinney not to ditch the \"progressive\" agenda that had been enshrined as part of that arrangement.\n\nScottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie said the party's seven MSPs would meet to discuss how they would vote in the ballot for first minister.\n\nMr Harvie stated: \"We are committed to delivering on our vision of a fairer, greener and more equal Scotland, and are open to talks with John Swinney and his team about how we can work together to make that happen.\"\n\nHe added: \"Scotland needs a period of stable government.\n\n\"Mr Swinney knows that if he is to have our support then it must be on the basis of progressive policies that help us to tackle the climate crisis and build a fairer and more equal future.\"\n\nThe Green MSP added: \"There are a lot of important policies already on their way to delivery as a result of the Bute House Agreement, including better rights for tenants and rent controls, transforming the way we heat our homes and a watertight ban on conversion therapy.\n\n\"We remain utterly committed to these policies and will oppose any move away from them or steps to dilute them.\"\n\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross meanwhile urged Mr Swinney to \"govern for all of Scotland by abandoning his relentless push for independence\".\n\nMr Ross insisted his party would seek to \"hold John Swinney to account when he lets the Scottish people down - just as we've done with Humza Yousaf\".\n\nBut the Conservative added: \"It's difficult to see how he can be the fresh start Scotland needs, when he's the ultimate continuity candidate.\n\n\"John Swinney was joined at the hip with the disgraced Nicola Sturgeon and his fingerprints are all over her numerous policy failures and cover-ups.\"\n\nWith Mr Swinney having led the SNP previously between 2000 and 2004, Mr Ross went on to question if a \"failed former leader from two decades ago - who, as education secretary, sent Scotland plummeting down international league tables\" was the best person to lead the country.\n\nHe claimed: \"With John Swinney at the helm, the SNP will double down on their independence obsession, the one issue they agree on, and ignore the real priorities of the Scottish people, such as fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy.\"\n\nMeanwhile Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said \"John Swinney's coronation is entirely about managing the SNP rather than running our country and delivering for Scotland.\n\n\"At a time when Scotland is crying out for change, the SNP is offering more of the same.\n\n\"John Swinney has been at the heart of this incompetent government for 17 years and at the heart of the SNP for 40 years.\"\n\nMr

That's been obvious to the public.\n\n\"The SNP has not looked cohesive, the SNP has not looked together - the central point of my message is we've got to get ourselves together.\"\n\nMr McCormick is a retired lawyer who stood against Mike Russell to become party president in 2023, losing by 599 votes to 79.\n\nHe previously argued for abolishing tax and replacing it with an annual rent on land, and that the route to Scottish independence lay through international treaties, with Scotland dissolving the union immediately if the SNP returned the most MPs in Scotland at a general election.\n\nIn a speech at the party conference he described the SNP government as being like \"flatulence in a trance.\"\n\nMr Swinney is the only declared candidate so far to succeed Humza Yousaf, who announced he would stand down after ending a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens.\n\nThe abrupt end of the Bute House Agreement came two days after Mr Yousaf said he had no intention of doing so, and left him facing two votes of no confidence.\n\nThe move angered the Greens, who had previously criticised the Scottish government for scrapping key climate targets and pausing puberty blockers for under 18s referred by the country's specialist gender clinic.\n\nLast year, Mr Yousaf only secured a narrow win over Kate Forbes in an often fractious SNP leadership contest - despite being Nicola Sturgeon's chosen successor.\n\nMr Swinney - who secured Kate Forbes' backing and has offered her a \"significant\" role in his government - said he wants to bring the party together after the last \"difficult\" leadership election.\n\nHe also said he is \"physically and mentally ready\" for the role, after he decided not to stand in the 2023 leadership contest.\n\nMr Swinney previously led the party for four years in opposition from 2000 to 2004.\n\nIf elected, he said he would seek to govern on a \"moderate centre left\" platform, and that he would be open to working with any other political party in the parliament to pass legislation.\n\nLast year Mr Swinney told the BBC's Nicola Sturgeon podcast that he had been trying to stand down from government since 2016.\n\nHowever he said he had been persuaded to run on this occasion after discussions with his family.\n\nHe chose not to run in 2023 as he felt \"tired and drained\" after a number of years in important roles, but that he was feeling refreshed after a year out of the cabinet.\n\nMr Swinney said: \"I thought it was time for other people to take leading roles... I thought I'd done my bit.\"\n\nHowever he said he now had \"peace of mind\" that running would be the \"right thing to do for me and my family, and my party and my country.\"\n\nThe Perthshire North MSP added that he was confident he would deliver independence, and that he would aim to do this through \"reasoned conversation\".\n\nScottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said it was \"laughable\" that Mr Swinney wanted to take conflict out of a push for independence.\n\nHe said: \"Scotland needs a first minister focused on the public's real priorities - fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy - not one fixated on dividing the nation just to pacify the warring SNP.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

As a party, we must heed his call, whatever has happened in the past should remain there.\n\n\"Let's get behind John & his team so they can deliver for Scotland.\"\n\nIt is the second time that Mr Swinney has taken on the leadership of his party, having previously held the job from 2000 to 2004.\n\nBut then he was leader of the main opposition party at Holyrood, with a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition in charge.\n\nNow, after holding a variety of senior posts in the Scottish Government, including finance secretary, education secretary and deputy first minister, a position he held for eight years under Nicola Sturgeon, he will get his first chance to be first minister.\n\nConfirmation of Mr Swinney's appointment as party leader comes 25 years to the day after the first elections to the Scottish Parliament with Mr Swinney one of only three MSPs to have held the same seat at Holyrood continuously since then.\n\nWhile Mr Yousaf's downfall was sparked by his decision to terminate the powersharing deal the SNP had had with the Scottish Greens, the smaller pro-independence party urged Mr Swinney not to ditch the \"progressive\" agenda that had been enshrined as part of that arrangement.\n\nScottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie said the party's seven MSPs would meet to discuss how they would vote in the ballot for first minister.\n\nMr Harvie stated: \"We are committed to delivering on our vision of a fairer, greener and more equal Scotland, and are open to talks with John Swinney and his team about how we can work together to make that happen.\"\n\nHe added: \"Scotland needs a period of stable government.\n\n\"Mr Swinney knows that if he is to have our support then it must be on the basis of progressive policies that help us to tackle the climate crisis and build a fairer and more equal future.\"\n\nThe Green MSP added: \"There are a lot of important policies already on their way to delivery as a result of the Bute House Agreement, including better rights for tenants and rent controls, transforming the way we heat our homes and a watertight ban on conversion therapy.\n\n\"We remain utterly committed to these policies and will oppose any move away from them or steps to dilute them.\"\n\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross meanwhile urged Mr Swinney to \"govern for all of Scotland by abandoning his relentless push for independence\".\n\nMr Ross insisted his party would seek to \"hold John Swinney to account when he lets the Scottish people down - just as we've done with Humza Yousaf\".\n\nBut the Conservative added: \"It's difficult to see how he can be the fresh start Scotland needs, when he's the ultimate continuity candidate.\n\n\"John Swinney was joined at the hip with the disgraced Nicola Sturgeon and his fingerprints are all over her numerous policy failures and cover-ups.\"\n\nWith Mr Swinney having led the SNP previously between 2000 and 2004, Mr Ross went on to question if a \"failed former leader from two decades ago - who, as education secretary, sent Scotland plummeting down international league tables\" was the best person to lead the country.\n\nHe claimed: \"With John Swinney at the helm, the SNP will double down on their independence obsession, the one issue they agree on, and ignore the real priorities of the Scottish people, such as fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy.\"\n\nMeanwhile Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said \"John Swinney's coronation is entirely about managing the SNP rather than running our country and delivering for Scotland.\n\n\"At a time when Scotland is crying out for change, the SNP is offering more of the same.\n\n\"John Swinney has been at the heart of this incompetent government for 17 years and at the heart of the SNP for 40 years.\"\n\nMr Sarwar said: \"From presiding over the exam results scandal as education secretary to destroying public finances as finance secretary, John Swinney's record is one of failure.\n\n\"This is a stitch-up by a chaotic and dysfunctional party that is more interested in protecting its own interests than serving the interests of the people of Scotland.\"",

As a party, we must heed his call, whatever has happened in the past should remain there.\n\n\"Let's get behind John & his team so they can deliver for Scotland.\"\n\nIt is the second time that Mr Swinney has taken on the leadership of his party, having previously held the job from 2000 to 2004.\n\nBut then he was leader of the main opposition party at Holyrood, with a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition in charge.\n\nNow, after holding a variety of senior posts in the Scottish Government, including finance secretary, education secretary and deputy first minister, a position he held for eight years under Nicola Sturgeon, he will get his first chance to be first minister.\n\nConfirmation of Mr Swinney's appointment as party leader comes 25 years to the day after the first elections to the Scottish Parliament with Mr Swinney one of only three MSPs to have held the same seat at Holyrood continuously since then.\n\nWhile Mr Yousaf's downfall was sparked by his decision to terminate the powersharing deal the SNP had had with the Scottish Greens, the smaller pro-independence party urged Mr Swinney not to ditch the \"progressive\" agenda that had been enshrined as part of that arrangement.\n\nScottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie said the party's seven MSPs would meet to discuss how they would vote in the ballot for first minister.\n\nMr Harvie stated: \"We are committed to delivering on our vision of a fairer, greener and more equal Scotland, and are open to talks with John Swinney and his team about how we can work together to make that happen.\"\n\nHe added: \"Scotland needs a period of stable government.\n\n\"Mr Swinney knows that if he is to have our support then it must be on the basis of progressive policies that help us to tackle the climate crisis and build a fairer and more equal future.\"\n\nThe Green MSP added: \"There are a lot of important policies already on their way to delivery as a result of the Bute House Agreement, including better rights for tenants and rent controls, transforming the way we heat our homes and a watertight ban on conversion therapy.\n\n\"We remain utterly committed to these policies and will oppose any move away from them or steps to dilute them.\"\n\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross meanwhile urged Mr Swinney to \"govern for all of Scotland by abandoning his relentless push for independence\".\n\nMr Ross insisted his party would seek to \"hold John Swinney to account when he lets the Scottish people down - just as we've done with Humza Yousaf\".\n\nBut the Conservative added: \"It's difficult to see how he can be the fresh start Scotland needs, when he's the ultimate continuity candidate.\n\n\"John Swinney was joined at the hip with the disgraced Nicola Sturgeon and his fingerprints are all over her numerous policy failures and cover-ups.\"\n\nWith Mr Swinney having led the SNP previously between 2000 and 2004, Mr Ross went on to question if a \"failed former leader from two decades ago - who, as education secretary, sent Scotland plummeting down international league tables\" was the best person to lead the country.\n\nHe claimed: \"With John Swinney at the helm, the SNP will double down on their independence obsession, the one issue they agree on, and ignore the real priorities of the Scottish people, such as fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy.\"\n\nMeanwhile Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said \"John Swinney's coronation is entirely about managing the SNP rather than running our country and delivering for Scotland.\n\n\"At a time when Scotland is crying out for change, the SNP is offering more of the same.\n\n\"John Swinney has been at the heart of this incompetent government for 17 years and at the heart of the SNP for 40 years.\"\n\nMr Sarwar said: \"From presiding over the exam results scandal as education secretary to destroying public finances as finance secretary, John Swinney's record is one of failure.\n\n\"This is a stitch-up by a chaotic and dysfunctional party that is more interested in protecting its own interests than serving the interests of the people of Scotland.\"",

He is likely to be officially sworn into the role of Scotland's seventh First Minister at the Court of Session on Wednesday, when he may also reshuffle the Cabinet.\n\nYesterday, Mr McCormick faced a backlash from senior figures in the party for challenging Mr Swinney and potentially drawing out the process of putting in place a new leader.\n\nSome of the party's politicians - including the net zero secretary Mairi McAllan - have warned another 'bruising' contest like last year's race could focus public attention on internal party divisions and harm the party in the coming weeks ahead of a general election, expected later this year.\n\nFormer SNP finance secretary Kate Forbes last week announced she would not stand in the SNP race to succeed Humza Yousaf. Photo: PA.\n\nPollster Mark Diffley noted such concerns on X, formerly Twitter, should Mr McCormick put himself forward.\n\n\"To put it mildly, if this happens it is not the situation that either John Swinney or the SNP will want. A three week series of debates and hustings which delays the inevitable, exposes divisions and costs money is not what the party needs right now,\" Mr Diffley said.\n\nIn TV interviews yesterday morning, Mr Swinney warned potential rivals about entering the race saying it would \"delay the ability for the [party] to start its rebuilding\".\n\nSNP member Graeme McCormick.\n\nHe told the Sky News programme Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips he felt an internal contest would hamper the SNP's ability to recover from its turbulent period quickly.\n\nThe MSP for North Perthshire said: \"I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we have had, under my leadership, and bluntly, I'd just like to get on with that as quickly as I possible can do, because every day that we spend in an internal contest, which I think we all probably know the outcome of, we delay the possibility for the SNP to start its rebuilding.\"\n\nResponding to Mr Swinney's interventions, Gillian Martin, SNP MSP for Aberdeenshire East, and minister for energy, just transition and fair work, wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"The question anyone who cares about our cause should ask themselves is, are my actions furthering that cause?\n\nGavin Newlands SNP for Paisley and Renfrewshire North also hit out over Mr McCormick's bid.\n\nHe wrote on X: \"I like the fact that the SNP are so democratic, but this attempt is a self-indulgent waste of time which is being egged-on by folk from other parties and seized on by the media with great glee. All whilst many of us are out campaigning hard for an SNP win in GE2024 for independence.\"\n\nRhiannon Spear, a former SNP councillor in Glasgow, described Mr McCormick's intention to enter the race as \"self serving\".\n\nShe wrote on X: \"Graeme McCormick is well aware that he will not win, yet he wants the SNP to plow money into his personal vanity project rather than into winning the GE or independence. I like that any member can stand for leader but this is entirely self serving and misguided.\"\n\nMeanwhile, some pro-Union figures appeared to relish to prospect of Mr McCormick standing.\n\nSam Taylor, chief executive of pro-UK group These Islands, posted a video of Mr McCormick's speech from last year's SNP conference and called Mr Swinney's comments suggesting a contest was not in the party's interests 'disrespectful'.\n\nHe wrote on X: \"Leadership contender Graeme McCormick gets a rapturous reception at last year's special SNP conference in Dundee. (He proposes a unilateral declaration of independence.)\"\n\nMr Taylor also noted: \"John Swinney writes off Graeme McCormick's chances before the contest has even begun. Very disrespectful.\"\n\nMr Swinney's expected succession to SNP leader comes after a week of drama at Holyrood, sparked by Mr Yousaf announcing last Thursday that he had terminated the powersharing agreement the SNP had with the Scottish Greens.\n\nThat decision ultimately brought to an end his 13-month tenure as First Minister.\n\nHe announced his resignation last Monday, saying he would stay on only until a successor is found.\n\nIf Mr Swinney does become SNP leader today he is likely to be formally elected as Scotland's seventh First Minister tomorrow.\n\nHe would then be formally sworn into the role at the Court of Session, probably on Wednesday, when he is also expected to reshuffle his Cabinet.\n\nLast year Mr McCormick challenged Michael Russell the then party president for his role.\n\nHowever, he lost the race with delegates to the party's annual conference voting by 79 to 599 for Mr Russell to continue. Mr Russell stood down from the role last December after taking up the post of chair of the Scottish Land Commission, a non political role. It is understood he is no longer a party member.\n\nIn a statement tonight, Mr McCormick said: \"I refer to my nomination to be Leader of the SNP and would thank everyone from across the country who support me. We met the thresholds set by the Party rules.\n\n\"I'd also like to put on record my thanks to John Swinney MSP with whom I had a lengthy and fruitful conversation.\n\n\"John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP, our Government and our people face, and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident, as they are advanced, will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider Independence Movement in the following weeks and months.\n\n\"This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians, and I'm sure that John's determination to deliver Independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming General Election.\n\n\"I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for Party Leader but instead support John Swinney's nomination for Party Leader and First Minister of Scotland\"", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Yousaf", "body": "John Swinney is to become the new SNP leader on Monday after he persuaded an activist who threatened to derail his coronation to abandon his leadership bid.\n\nGraeme McCormick, a long-standing SNP member, had threatened to plunge the SNP into a costly and divisive leadership contest after he claimed he had secured enough support to force a leadership election.\n\nHowever, he revealed on Sunday night that he had held \"lengthy and fruitful talks\" with Mr Swinney and had decided to support his candidacy instead.\n\nIt means Mr Swinney is expected to be the only candidate for SNP leader when nominations close at midday on Monday, and is set to become the new first minister on Tuesday.\n\nWhile Mr Swinney would have been certain to win any leadership election, a contest would have prolonged Humza Yousaf's disastrous tenure until the end of the month and cost the cast-strapped SNP tens of thousands of pounds in an election year.\n\nMr McCormick, who was seen collecting nominations at an independence march in Glasgow on Saturday, said he had met the threshold to stand in the contest.\n\nUnder SNP rules, only 100 nominations are needed from 20 separate branches to make it onto the ballot.\n\n\"I'd also like to put on record my thanks to John Swinney MSP with whom I had a lengthy and fruitful conversation,\" he added.\n\n\"John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP, our Government and our people face, and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident, as they are advanced, will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months.\n\n\"This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians, and I'm sure that John's determination to deliver independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.\n\n\"I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney's nomination for party

deal with Greens", "body": "Presumptive SNP leader and first minister John Swinney has been urged by the Scottish Conservatives to drop his party's push for independence and refuse to work with the Greens.\n\nIn a letter likely to get short shrift from the veteran MSP, Tory leader Douglas Ross pushed Mr Swinney to commit not to request the powers to hold another independence referendum for the entirety of his time in power if he becomes first minister.\n\nThe former deputy first minister looks set to take the top job after Kate Forbes - thought to be the only other realistic contender for the role - announced on Thursday she will not run.\n\nMr Ross's letter - packed with inflammatory language including accusations of a \"stitch up\" for Mr Swinney to get the job - said: \"As it appears that you have already won your party's leadership contest, it is now essential that you set the right tone should you be elected as first minister next week, one which appeals to the whole of Scotland, not just SNP members.\n\n\"As such, you should make it inescapably clear that independence is no longer a priority for your Government.\"\n\nHe goes on to push Mr Swinney to scrap the role of independence minister - currently held by Jamie Hepburn - as well as to cancel independence papers published by Nicola Sturgeon and Humza Yousaf, and not to request vote powers from Westminster.\n\nDoing so, Mr Ross said, would \"free up Government time and strategic direction to focus on the many failings in Government of the SNP over the past 17 years\".\n\nMr Ross also urged the potential future first minister to rule out a deal with the Scottish Greens, who he called \"extreme\" and \"anti-economic growth\".\n\nThe SNP does not have a majority in Parliament and will likely need to look to other parties for support to pass legislation - not least to ensure its new leader is elected first minister.\n\nGiven the acrimony between parties at Holyrood, the pro-independence Greens seem the most likely party to work with the SNP.\n\nBut Mr Ross said Green MSPs should not be appointed as ministers - as had been the case under the Bute House Agreement - and he called on the Scottish Government to commit to support new oil and gas licences in the North Sea and to \"major road upgrades\", such as dualling the A9 and A96.\n\nA Green MSP has already said a new Bute House Agreement, or similar deal, is \"very, very unlikely\" to come to fruition under Mr Swinney.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Scotland on Friday, Gillian Mackay said: \"I think the likelihood is that we will be engaging on an issue by issue basis with whoever it is that is in the first minister's seat in the coming weeks.\"\n\nMr Ross's comments came after one of the most senior ministers in Humza Yousaf's Government said SNP members do not want a repeat of the \"bruising\" leadership election of last year.\n\nNet Zero Secretary Mairi McAllan, who introduced Mr Swinney at his campaign launch in Edinburgh on Thursday, said the Perthshire North MSP is the \"right man\" to unite the party.\n\nIt follows a tough week for the SNP at Holyrood, which began when Mr Yousaf abruptly ended the powersharing Bute House Agreement with the Greens and saw the fallout force him to resign after 13 months as First Minister.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Scotland, Ms McAllan said: \"There is a sense within the party that the last contest was a particularly bruising one, and I think there is absolutely a sense among members and activists that many of us would not wish to see that repeated.\n\n\"I think what the biggest deciding factor has been so far is the stature of John Swinney as somebody who has come forward.\n\n\"He is well loved and respected within our party, and I think, most importantly actually, he commands the trust and confidence of the people of Scotland, which we in the SNP know is exactly what is needed right now.\"\n\nThe 2023 party leadership contest to replace Nicola Sturgeon saw Mr Yousaf, Ms Forbes and Ash Regan fight for the top job.\n\nThe contest saw the candidates take aim at each other's record in government and their views on social issues.\n\nA spokesman for Mr Swinney said: \"If elected as first minister, Mr Swinney has committed to engaging in substantive and meaningful dialogue with all parties in the Scottish Parliament.\n\n\"No reasonable individual could conclude that Douglas Ross's letter is an accurate assessment of the SNP's record or a helpful contribution to public discourse.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.stv.tv",

It will be the NHS, our schools and our public services. It will be addressing the climate crisis.\n\n\"Do not let our disagreements dominate. Join me as we open a new chapter. That's my job, that's our job, and I plan to get the job done.\"\n\nHe condemned \"polarisation\" and pledged to \"listen\" to factions within the party, and said he had met ex-finance secretary Kate Forbes to discuss \"shared ambitions\" and \"how best to go forward\".\n\nMr Swinney said: \"The polarisation of politics does not serve our country well. We should be seeking solutions to problems.\n\n\"I will reach out to everyone willing to join with us in good faith and seek compromises that serve our nation well. We need to stop shouting at each other and talk. More than that, actually, we need to listen. As first minister, I will do exactly that.\"\n\nMr Swinney will now face a vote at Holyrood later this week, where it is likely he will become the Scottish Parliament's nominated candidate to be the country's seventh first minister.\n\nMr Yousaf congratulated Mr Swinney on becoming the new SNP leader.\n\nMr Yousaf posted on X, formerly Twitter: \"Congratulations to @JohnSwinney on becoming Leader of @theSNP and FM-elect.\n\n\"John's central message has been one of unity. As a party, we must heed his call, whatever has happened in the past should remain there.\n\n\"Let's get behind John & his team so they can deliver for Scotland.\"\n\nIt comes just a week after Mr Yousaf announced he was stepping down as both SNP leader and Scottish First Minister, after his decision to tear up his party's powersharing deal with the Greens at Holyrood left him facing a vote of confidence.\n\nScottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie said the party's seven MSPs would meet to discuss how they would vote in the ballot for first minister.\n\nMr Harvie stated: \"We are committed to delivering on our vision of a fairer, greener and more equal Scotland, and are open to talks with John Swinney and his team about how we can work together to make that happen.\"\n\nHe added: \"Scotland needs a period of stable government. Mr Swinney knows that if he is to have our support then it must be on the basis of progressive policies that help us to tackle the climate crisis and build a fairer and more equal future.\"\n\nThe Green MSP added: \"There are a lot of important policies already on their way to delivery as a result of the Bute House Agreement, including better rights for tenants and rent controls, transforming the way we heat our homes and a watertight ban on conversion therapy.\n\n\"We remain utterly committed to these policies and will oppose any move away from them or steps to dilute them.\"\n\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross urged Mr Swinney to \"govern for all of Scotland by abandoning his relentless push for independence\".\n\nMr Ross insisted his party would seek to \"hold John Swinney to account when he lets the Scottish people down - just as we've done with Humza Yousaf\".\n\nBut the Conservative added: \"It's difficult to see how he can be the fresh start Scotland needs, when he's the ultimate continuity candidate.\n\n\"John Swinney was joined at the hip with the disgraced Nicola Sturgeon and his fingerprints are all over her numerous policy failures and cover-ups.\"\n\nWith Mr Swinney having led the SNP previously between 2000 and 2004, Mr Ross went on to question if a \"failed former leader from two decades ago - who, as education secretary, sent Scotland plummeting down international league tables\" was the best person to lead the country.\n\nHe claimed: \"With John Swinney at the helm, the SNP will double down on their independence obsession - the one issue they agree on - and ignore the real priorities of the Scottish people, such as fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy.\"\n\nMr Swinney has been an MSP for the life of Holyrood and has previously said the UK Government was to blame for failures in devolution.\n\nSpeaking last week on the same day that Mr Yousaf announced his resignation as First Minister, Mr Swinney complained about the \"hostile outlook from the UK Government towards devolution\".He said: \"For most of the devolution years, the UK Government has been a rather benign presence in the operation of the devolved structures.\n\n\"That is different now. Should future UK governments take the same attitude, it would pose a real threat to the prospects and effectiveness of devolution.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

If one does take place, Swinney will not be appointed as first minister until late May.\n\nOne of McCormick's backers, Iain Lawson, posted on X on Sunday that he had already obtained the 100 signatures required and was planning to hand them in to the SNP \"in person\".\n\nLawson also attacked Swinney for criticising the move, and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and \"raging\" that an ordinary member was challenging him.\n\n\"So Graeme McCormick has succeeded in getting the nominations he needed. Disappointed that JS [Swinney] has already had a dig at him before nominations even close for daring to challenge him. He is to give ordinary members the chance to question the new leader. New idea?\"\n\nMcCormick, some of whose allies want the Scottish government to mount a second independence referendum without Westminster's approval, won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP's caution as \"flatulence in a trance\" during last year's party conference.\n\nNominations to succeed Humza Yousaf as SNP leader close at noon on Monday. If another candidate crosses the nominations threshold and forces a contest, Yousaf is expected to remain in post and as Scotland's first minister until a winner is declared.\n\nMcCormick was very confident he would gather the signatures before the deadline after canvassing for support at an independence rally in Glasgow organised by All Under One Banner, the Sunday Herald newspaper reported.\n\nSwinney, who has been expecting to be confirmed as the new SNP leader on Monday afternoon and be voted in as first minister this week, warned on Sunday that a contest would delay his efforts to rebuild the party and put its deep divisions on public display.\n\n\"I think it would be better if we just got on with things, that we started the rebuilding of the SNP and its political strength,\" he told BBC Scotland's Sunday Show. \"We had a lot of strains around a couple of issues in parliament and I think we've just had a rough couple of years.\n\n\"[The] SNP has not looked cohesive; the SNP has not looked together. The central point of my message is we've got to get ourselves together.\"\n\nAn unopposed coronation would not be the SNP's first: Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond in November 2014 without a contest.\n\nSwinney's call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland, which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.\n\nThe poll, the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week, put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats, a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15. Labour, which has only two Scottish seats, would win 28.\n\nMeanwhile, former SNP leadership candidate Kate Forbes confirmed earlier she was not standing and backed Swinney, having been promised a \"significant\" cabinet role if he becomes first minister.\n\nIf no other candidate meets the nomination deadline, Swinney would be free to seek parliamentary approval to become first minister.\n\nYousaf has decided to stay on in the role until a replacement is selected. Once his resignation has been accepted by the King, parliament has 28 days to select a replacement.\n\nThere will then be a vote in the chamber to decide the new first minister, which is passed by a simple majority. The SNP has 63 seats in the parliament, which means it does not have a majority, but the vote is likely to pass regardless.\n\nThe parliament's presiding officer then recommends to the King that the winner be appointed as the new first minister.\n\nYousaf announced his intention to step down from the role last Monday. He had ended the Bute House Agreement with the Scottish Greens, leaving him short of support for the minority SNP government at Holyrood.\n\nHe would have faced two votes of no confidence in his leadership last week had he not stood down.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives dropped their motion after his departure was confirmed, while Scottish Labour's - which was a vote of confidence in the entire government - was defeated with backing from the Greens. His resignation came 13 months after defeating Ms Forbes and Ash Regan, who has since defected to the Alba Party, in the race to replace Nicola Sturgeon.", "source": {"uri": "asianlite.com",

the one issue they agree on - and ignore the real priorities of the Scottish people, such as fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy.\"\n\n\"John Swinney has been at the heart of this incompetent government for 17 years and at the heart of the SNP for 40 years.\n\n\"From presiding over the exam results scandal as education secretary to destroying public finances as finance secretary, John Swinney's record is one of failure.\"\n\nSimilarly, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said: \"As his party's leader and a former wingman to both Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon, John Swinney is now answerable for the SNP's appalling neglect of public services over the past 17 years.\n\n\"He should immediately announce a plan for cutting NHS waiting lists and stopping sewage flowing into our rivers and if he can't do that he should announce an election.\"", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Glasgow", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Glasgow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Ross_(Scottish_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Ross (Scottish politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Conservatives", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Conservatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Liberal_Democrats", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Liberal Democrats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Salmond", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Salmond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cole-Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cole-Hamilton"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Highland_Games", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Highland Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://d3gvyx4eg3tne0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Img37994726.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

has lurched from crisis to crisis since Nicola Sturgeon announced she was quitting as leader last February, was desperate to avoid a drawn out leadership contest.\n\nThe last poll, to replace Ms

1999, is seen by many as being able to provide calm leadership at what is a time of political turmoil for Scotland's governing party.\n\nHe has previously served as finance secretary under Alex Salmond when the SNP took power in 2007.\n\nHe served in the role for the entirety of Mr Salmond's tenure, before being appointed deputy first minister by Nicola Sturgeon when she took over.\n\nOver the following nine years, the Perthshire North MSP occupied several ministerial offices in the Scottish Government, including as education secretary, Covid-19 recovery secretary and again in finance, taking over that brief from Ms Forbes while she was on maternity leave.\n\nDuring his time as Ms Sturgeon's deputy, he cemented his reputation as a dogged defender of his boss, as well as an SNP

Mr Swinney had looked like he would become SNP leader and First Minister uncontested after rival Kate Forbes ruled herself out of the race.\n\nBut SNP rules allow anyone who can get 100 signatures from 20 branches to run to be party leader. Mr McCormick, a retired solicitor who was convenor of the SNP's Dumbarton branch, would not be able to become First Minister as he is not an elected politician.\n\nFormer deputy first minister John Swinney had been hoping to become SNP leader without a contest\n\nBut he could still force Mr Swinney into a contest if he gets enough signatures by midday on Monday, prolonging the chaos within the party following Humza Yousaf's resignation. Today, Mr Swinney argued a leadership race would delay attempts to rebuild the party.\n\nThe former Deputy First Minister told Sky News: \"I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we have had, under my leadership, and bluntly, I'd just like to get on with that as quickly as I possible can do, because every day that we spend in an internal contest, which I think we all probably know the outcome of, we delay the possibility for the SNP to start its rebuilding.\"\n\nHe told the BBC he would respect the \"democratic process\" if there was a contest but added: \"I think it would be better if we just got on with things, that we started the rebuilding of the SNP and its political strength.\"\n\nAsked about the disunity within the party, he pointed to the bitter leadership race to succeed Nicola Sturgeon last year, which saw Mr Yousaf, Ms Forbes and Ash Regan tear chunks out of each other. \"I think we have basically just had a rough couple of years,\" he added.\n\nIf Mr McCormick gets enough signatures, a leadership race will run until May 27. But if Mr Swinney is unopposed, he will be named as the next SNP leader and become First Minister as early as next week. Mr Swinney, who led the SNP in opposition from 2000 to 2004, faced a leadership challenge from an activist in 2003 but won with 83.9% of the vote.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lizzy_buchan@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lizzy Buchan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Conservative_Party_leadership_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2019 Conservative Party leadership election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deputy First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solicitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbarton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dumbarton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dumbarton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Regan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ash Regan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enda_Kenny", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enda Kenny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32739830.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_AHP_CHP_25765.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 2177, "textEnd": 2183}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

After nominations for the post closed, the former Scottish Deputy First Minister was confirmed as the only person to put themselves forward to succeed Humza Yousaf.\n\nMr Swinney will now face a vote at Holyrood later this week, where it is likely he will become the Scottish Parliament's nominated candidate to be the country's seventh First Minister. It comes just a week after Mr Yousaf announced he was stepping down as both SNP leader and Scottish First Minister, after his decision to tear up his party's powersharing deal with the Greens at Holyrood left him facing a vote of confidence.\n\nFollowing his announcement as leader, Mr Swinney posted on social media: \"I am deeply honoured to have been elected as leader of @theSNP I will give all that I have to serve my party and my country.\"\n\nThe SNP said in a statement: \"The SNP's nomination process closed at noon today (Monday, May 6). The party's national secretary, Lorna Finn, has subsequently confirmed John Swinney MSP as the new SNP Leader. The SNP Leader will deliver a speech later today.\"\n\nConfirmation of Mr Swinney's appointment as party leader comes 25 years to the day after the first elections to the Scottish Parliament - with Mr Swinney one of only three MSPs to have held the same seat at Holyrood continuously since then. While Mr Yousaf's downfall was sparked by his decision to terminate the powersharing deal the SNP had had with the Scottish Greens, the smaller pro-independence party urged Mr Swinney not to ditch the \"progressive\" agenda that had been enshrined as part of that arrangement.\n\nScottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie said the party's seven MSPs would meet to discuss how they would vote in the ballot for First Minister.\n\nMr Harvie stated: \"We are committed to delivering on our vision of a fairer, greener and more equal Scotland, and are open to talks with John Swinney and his team about how we can work together to make that happen.\"\n\nHe added: \"Scotland needs a period of stable government. Mr Swinney knows that if he is to have our support then it must be on the basis of progressive policies that help us to tackle the climate crisis and build a fairer and more equal future.\"\n\nThe Green MSP added: \"There are a lot of important policies already on their way to delivery as a result of the Bute House Agreement, including better rights for tenants and rent controls, transforming the way we heat our homes and a watertight ban on conversion therapy. We remain utterly committed to these policies and will oppose any move away from them or steps to dilute them.\"\n\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross meanwhile urged Mr Swinney to \"govern for all of Scotland by abandoning his relentless push for independence\". Mr Ross insisted his party would seek to \"hold John Swinney to account when he lets the Scottish people down - just as we've done with Humza Yousaf\".\n\nBut the Conservative added: \"It's difficult to see how he can be the fresh start Scotland needs, when he's the ultimate continuity candidate. John Swinney was joined at the hip with the disgraced Nicola Sturgeon and his fingerprints are all over her numerous policy failures and cover-ups.\"\n\nWith Mr Swinney having led the SNP previously between 2000 and 2004, Mr Ross went on to question if a \"failed former leader from two decades ago - who, as education secretary, sent Scotland plummeting down international league tables\" was the best person to\n\nlead the country.\n\nHe claimed: \"With John Swinney at the helm, the SNP will double down on their independence obsession - the one issue they agree on - and ignore the real priorities of the Scottish people, such as fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy.\"", "source": {"uri": "nottinghampost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nottingham Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "press_association@nottinghampost.com", "name": "Press Association", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "steven_smith@nottinghampost.com", "name": "Steven Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Harvie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Harvie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deputy First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party\u2013Scottish_Greens_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party\u2013Scottish Greens agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Ross_(Scottish_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Ross (Scottish politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Conservatives", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Conservatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conversion therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Lineage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Lineage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Recycling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Highland_Games", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Highland Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.aberdeenlive.news/incoming/article8150684.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Scottish-Daily-Politics-2023.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1023, "textEnd": 1028}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The SNP has faced turmoil, including a campaign finance scandal involving former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's husband. Swinney aims to stabilize the party amidst challenges including the loss of the Greens as a coalition partner and divisions over independence. Despite criticism from political opponents, Swinney pledges a center-left government focused on economic and social issues. He will advocate for Scottish independence, citing Brexit and the cost-of-living crisis as reasons for Scotland to have its own decision-making powers.\n\nScotland's former deputy first minister was poised to become its third leader in just over a year after taking the helm of the troubled Scottish National Party on Monday.\n\nJohn Swinney, who led the SNP two decades ago, was the only candidate to replace First Minister Humza Yousaf as the leader of the party.\n\nThe SNP has been in turmoil since long-serving First Minister Nicola Sturgeon abruptly stepped down last year during a campaign finance investigation that eventually led to criminal charges against her husband.\n\nSwinney, 60, who joined the party at age 15, will try to bring stability to the SNP as it fights efforts by opponents to weaken it going into UK-wide parliamentary elections expected later this year.\n\n\"The polarisation of politics does not serve our country well,'' Swinney said as he was named party leader. \"I will reach out to everyone willing to join with us in good faith and seek compromises that serve our nation well. We need to stop shouting at each other and talk. More than that, actually, we need to listen. As first minister, I will do exactly that.\" Yousaf announced his resignation last week after a political miscalculation in which he booted the Green Party from the ruling coalition of Scotland's semiautonomous government. The SNP is one seat short of a majority in the local parliament with 63 of the 128 voting seats, so it needs to partner with at least one opposition party.\n\nThe pro-independence SNP was weakened by the campaign finance scandal and divisions over transgender rights, but was ultimately brought down by Yousaf's decision to oust the Greens because of differences over climate change goals. Yousaf was unable to persuade other parties to back his minority government in Scotland's parliament.\n\nFacing the prospect of two no-confidence votes that had been scheduled, Yousaf quit rather than be forced out. Yousaf will remain first minister until his replacement is elected. Swinney is likely to be elected to that position later this week.\n\nSwinney thanked Yousaf for serving with \"grace and dignity,\" and said that his \"moral leadership on the issue of Gaza has been a light in very dark times.'' Yousaf won a bruising campaign to take over the party after Sturgeon, who was first minister for eight years, resigned unexpectedly in February 2023. About a month later, Sturgeon's husband, Peter Murrell, who was the party's chief executive, was arrested as police investigated how 600,000 pounds ($750,000) earmarked for a Scottish independence campaign was spent. Sturgeon and Colin Beattie, the party's former treasurer, were later arrested and questioned in the inquiry, but they were released without being charged with a crime. Murrell was charged last month with embezzlement. Swinney had served as Sturgeon's deputy first minister during her tenure as Scotland's leader, but stepped down when she left office.\n\nConservative leader Douglas Ross said that Swinney's past makes him unlikely to bring the change that Scotland needs.\n\n\"John Swinney was joined at the hip with the disgraced Nicola Sturgeon and his fingerprints are all over her numerous policy failures and cover-ups,\" Ross said. Swinney pledged to lead a center-left government focused on the economy, jobs, the cost of living, the National Health Service, schools, public services and the \"climate crisis.\" Swinney said that he would make his case to persuade people of the need for Scottish independence, which voters rejected in 2014. He cited Brexit and the cost-of-living crisis, which he blamed on U.K. politicians in London, as being bad for Scotland.\n\n\"They demonstrate why Scotland needs to have independence to make our own decisions and create our best future,\" he said. \"If someone is an independence supporter in Scotland and they want Scotland to be independent, there's only one political party that will ever deliver and that's the Scottish National Party.\" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar echoed Ross' remarks, saying that the \"SNP is offering more of the same.\" \"John Swinney has been at the heart of this incompetent government for 17 years and at the heart of the SNP for 40 years,'' Sarwar said. ''John Swinney's record is one of failure.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType":

Last week his most likely rival, Kate Forbes, a former finance secretary who came close to beating Yousaf last year, ruled herself out of the contest and backed Swinney, saying she was persuaded by his pledge to \"govern from the mainstream\". A last-minute threat to the coronation was averted late on Sunday when the SNP activist and serial leadership critic Graeme McCormick chose to back Swinney after a \"lengthy and fruitful conversation\".\n\nEndorsed by senior figures across the party, Swinney told his audience that his amicable talks with Forbes and McCormick demonstrated that \"the SNP is coming back together again now\".\n\nThe 60-year-old, who has held numerous senior positions at party and government level, including a previous stint as leader from 2000-04, said he would be calling on \"skills honed over decades\" to put together \"an inclusive and unified team\", enable \"open and respectful dialogue\" across the party and ensure that the SNP \"looks outward to the people of our country and inward to ourselves\".\n\nWith recent polling indicating a further slump in support for the party in a Westminster election and Scottish independence supporters no longer automatically aligning with the SNP, Swinney said he wanted to earn those votes back.\n\n\"The SNP's been having a tough, rough time. It has lacked cohesion and that has come across to members of the public and they are worried about where we are as a party.\"\n\nHe added: \"If there's some disaffection between people who support independence and previously voted for the SNP I will be working very, very hard to win those people back\".\n\nYousaf dramatically quit last Monday after he unilaterally axed a three-year-old governing agreement with the Scottish Greens, prompting them to back a vote of no confidence tabled by the Scottish Conservatives. With his own party two votes short of a Holyrood majority, Yousaf found himself unable to garner sufficient cross-party support.\n\nSwinney, who is expected to be voted in as first minister by MSPs on Tuesday, must now lead a minority government. He said he intended to find \"common cause\" with parties across the Holyrood chamber, working \"issue by issue\", but would not return to \"fixed arrangements\" such as the Bute House deal with the Scottish Greens.\n\nHe added he was sure there remained \"a lot of common ground\" with the Greens, who want Swinney's administration to press ahead with policy priorities including rent controls and a ban on conversion practices.\n\nAddressing speculation that he would move the SNP back to the centre ground and away from Green-led policies such as gender recognition reform that have proved distracting and divisive for the party and unpopular with voters, Swinney said he would follow a \"moderate centre-left agenda - that's where I come from, that's where my party's policy base is and that's how we'll take it forward\".\n\nHe added that his driving principle was to eradicate the \"curse\" of child poverty, saying there was no need for a Holyrood election to secure a personal mandate.\n\nSwinney also paid tribute to Yousaf, who he said had acted with \"grace and dignity in acutely difficult circumstances\" such as the period when his in-laws were trapped in Gaza under Israeli bombardment last autumn, adding he was sure he still had a significant contribution to make to Scottish politics.\n\nBut his entreaties to work cross-party were roundly dismissed by opposition leaders. The Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, said: \"John Swinney's coronation is entirely about managing the SNP rather than running our country and delivering for Scotland.\"\n\nHe added: \"John Swinney has been at the heart of this incompetent government for 17 years ... From presiding over the exam results scandal as education secretary to destroying public finances as finance secretary, John Swinney's record is one of failure.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Glasgow", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Glasgow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Secretary_for_Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet Secretary for Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Conservatives", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Conservatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Labour", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bute_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bute House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centre-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anas_Sarwar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anas Sarwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/7a96e1e328cd78e90197d12ebb835f15", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

would delay rebuild, says Swinney", "body": "John Swinney has argued a divisive SNP leadership contest could delay the party's essential \"rebuild\" amid reports a veteran activist could enter the race to replace Humza Yousaf.\n\nThe former deputy first minister could become SNP leader from Monday afternoon if he runs unopposed, with Mr Swinney stating he would like to get on with that job \"as quickly as possible\".\n\nHowever, reports suggest a leadership battle may be on the cards after activist Graeme McCormick used the independence march in Glasgow to drum up support for his candidacy.\n\nIt is understood Mr McCormick believes he is very likely to receive the 100 nominations from at least 20 SNP branches before the Monday deadline.\n\nBluntly, I'd just like to get on with that as quickly as I possible can do, because every day that we spend in an internal contest, which I think we all probably know the outcome of, we delay the possibility for the SNP to start its rebuilding John Swinney, SNP MSP\n\nMr McCormick has previously been critical of the SNP-led Scottish Government, using last year's party conference to criticise its independence strategy.\n\nIf he won the leadership race against Mr Swinney, he would not be able to become first minister as he is not elected in the Scottish Parliament, with Mr McCormick reportedly telling members he believes the roles should be run by two different individuals.\n\nFormer deputy first minister of Scotland John Swinney is so far the only candidate confirmed in the SNP leadership race (Jane Barlow/PA)\n\nBut, Mr Swinney, who at this point remains the only confirmed candidate, told the Sky News programme Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips he felt an internal contest would hamper the SNP's ability to recover from its turbulent period quickly.\n\nHe said: \"I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we have had, under my leadership, and bluntly, I'd just like to get on with that as quickly as I possible can do, because every day that we spend in an internal contest, which I think we all probably know the outcome of, we delay the possibility for the SNP to start its rebuilding.\"\n\nMr Swinney told the programme his leadership bid had received \"very, very comprehensive support\", including from former finance secretary Kate Forbes, who earlier ruled herself out of the contest.\n\nShould Mr McCormick receive the required nominations, a three-week leadership contest will be triggered, with ballots opening on Monday May 13 and closing on May 27.\n\nBut if Mr Swinney runs unopposed, he will be the next SNP leader and he will likely become first minister as early as next week after a Holyrood vote.\n\nMr Swinney, who previously led his party from 2000 to 2004, faced a leadership challenge from an activist in 2003 but ultimately won the contest with 83.9% of the vote.\n\nSpeaking later on BBC Scotland's the Sunday Show, he said he would respect the \"democratic process\" if there was a contest but added: \"I think it would be better if we just got on with things, that we started the rebuilding of the SNP and its political strength.\"\n\nHe added he thought the \"overwhelming majority\" of party members \"wanted to get on with it\".\n\nAsked where the party \"disunity\" came from, he cited the difficult leadership contest in 2023, which saw Mr Yousaf, Ms Forbes and Ash Regan, condemn each other's records and social views.\n\n\"I think we have basically just had a rough couple of years,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

SNP veteran and Sturgeon loyalist facing new challenges", "body": "Scotland's next First Minister is a man of 'deep Christian faith' - but was said to be too boring for SNP backer Sean Connery\n\nJohn Swinney has been confirmed as the next SNP leader, after an obscure Scottish independence activist briefly sparked panic in the party hierarchy before dropping a threatened leadership bid.\n\nIt meant that Mr Swinney, 60, enjoyed an unopposed coronation, after being backed by a plethora of senior party figures in the chaotic aftermath of Humza Yousaf's resignation last week.\n\nThe SNP veteran could become Scotland's First Minister as early as Tuesday, with MSPs expected to elect him at Holyrood at some point in the next two days.\n\nThe former Deputy First Minister is viewed as a safe pair of hands after a period of turmoil for the SNP, having enjoyed senior roles in the governments of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon.\n\nBut because of his closeness to both Ms Sturgeon and Mr Yousaf, he faces the difficult task of shrugging off accusations that he is the \"continuity\" figure offering \"more of the same\".\n\nIt is not even the first time the Perthshire MSP has led the SNP. He was in charge of the party between 2000 and 2004 while it was in opposition, but stood down after a string of disappointing election results.\n\nAccording to polling guru Prof John Curtice, Mr Swinney \"wasn't really that good at\" leading the SNP. The party failed to make any progress at the 2001 general election and lost eight MSPs at the 2003 Holyrood election.\n\nBefore stepping down, Mr Swinney was warned by his former adviser Michael Russsell to expect a visit from \"the men in grey kilts\", telling him that it was time to go.\n\nNow, those same SNP bosses have paved the way for Mr Swinney's return to the top job - but he faces a very different set of challenges from last time around.\n\nAfter the turbulence of Mr Yousaf's year in charge, Mr Swinney has been put in place to unite the SNP and shore up the party's flagging vote by proving he can run a steady, credible minority government.\n\nProf Curtice has suggested that pushing out Mr Yousaf was \"the worst thing unionists could have done\", since Mr Swinney now has an opportunity to restore the party's previous reputation for competence.\n\nMr Swinney, who has three children and is married to BBC reporter Elizabeth Quigley, joined the SNP in 1979 as a 15-year-old.\n\nThe Edinburgh University graduate, who started out working in insurance, was elected to Westminster for North Tayside in 1997, before becoming an MSP at Holyrood in 1999.\n\nHe has never been viewed as a charismatic politician. James Bond star Sean Connery, a leading Scottish independence backer, reportedly thought that Mr Swinney was too boring to be leader during his first stint in charge.\n\nHowever, he remains highly respected in his party, earning the nickname \"honest John\" for his economic management during his decade as Finance Secretary in the Salmond and Sturgeon governments.\n\nMr Swinney has also skillfully negotiated the big hurdle of the past week. He managed to convince his only potential rival, 34-year-old Kate Forbes, to take a job in government.\n\nHe publicly offered Ms Forbes a \"significant\" role, though it is not clear whether he will make the ambitious, socially-conservative MSP his deputy leader in a bid to end divisions inside the SNP.\n\nThere has been bad blood since Mr Swinney last year questioned whether it was \"appropriate\" for someone with Ms Forbes views - she would not have voted to legalise same-sex marriage - to be SNP leader.\n\nMr Swinney, a member of the Church of Scotland, has described himself as a man of \"deep Christian faith\". But he has proved to be a social liberal, supporting the attempt to bring in the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill, which would have made it easier for transgender people to self-identify. The Bill was eventually blocked by the UK Government.\n\nHe has signalled he wants to move away from some of the left-wing, Green-led policies of the last three years, agreeing with Ms Forbes that the net zero transition must \"work with and not against\" Scotland's oil and gas industry.\n\nDuring his first four years as Finance Secretary, Mr Swinney was forced to steer budgets through Holyrood with the backing of opposition parties. He faces the same task again, after Mr Yousaf's decided to tear up the coalition agreement with the Scottish Greens.\n\nMr Swinney says he is in the job for the long haul. He has insisted he is \"no caretaker\" First Minister, and can lead the party beyond the 2026 Holyrood election.\n\nBut that will depend on general election results, on Ms Forbes' ambitions, and whether Mr Swinney can act as new broom, able to sweep the SNP's recent troubles away.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri":

So I think that is the scope.\"\n\nSwinney's comments were made three days before he announced his candidacy.\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has also said he would support a new version of Fresh Talent if Keir Starmer becomes Prime Minister.\n\nAn SNP source said a successor scheme could be negotiated if a future Labour Government was willing to get round the table.\n\nMeanwhile, an SNP Cabinet Secretary said party members did not want to see a repeat of last year's \"bruising\" leadership contest.\n\nNominations for SNP leader close on Monday and possible candidates to run against Swinney have ruled themselves out.\n\nNet Zero Secretary Mairi McAllan, who introduced Swinney at his campaign launch in Edinburgh, said he is the \"right man\" to unite the party.\n\nShe also spoke about last year's contest between Yousaf, Forbes and Ash Regan, who has since defected to Alba:\n\n\"There is a sense within the party that the last contest was a particularly bruising one, and I think there is absolutely a sense among members and activists that many of us would not wish to see that repeated.\n\n\"I think what the biggest deciding factor has been so far is the stature of John Swinney as somebody who has come forward.\n\n\"He is well loved and respected within our party, and I think, most importantly actually, he commands the trust and confidence of the people of Scotland, which we in the SNP know is exactly what is needed right now.\"\n\nShe rejected claims Swinney, who previously led the SNP between 2000 and 2004, is \"yesterday's man\".\n\nHe also served as Nicola Sturgeon's deputy for more than eight years, while also holding some of the biggest cabinet positions of education and finance.\n\nMcAllan said: \"John was very clear, the SNP has admittedly been having a difficult period. He is the right man for the moment to unite our party.\"\n\nShe dismissed claims the Scottish independence movement has hit the rocks.\n\n\"Independence is not dead for a generation,\" she said.\n\n\"We are at a situation in Scotland where half the population, give or take between polls, supports independence for our nation.\"\n\nIn another development, Green MSP Gillian Mackay said her party is likely to work with the next first minister on an \"issue by issue basis\".\n\nShe said a new Bute House Agreement, which was ditched by Yousaf and cost him his job, is \"very, very unlikely\".\n\nShe also said the Greens had \"not taken any decision\" on how the party will vote when the decision to select a new first minister is put to Holyrood.\n\nTo sign up to the Daily Record

Swinney knows that if he is to have our support then it must be on the basis of progressive policies that help us to tackle the climate crisis and build a fairer and more equal future.\"\n\nThe Green MSP added: \"There are a lot of important policies already on their way to delivery as a result of the Bute House Agreement, including better rights for tenants and rent controls, transforming the way we heat our homes and a watertight ban on conversion therapy.\n\n\"We remain utterly committed to these policies and will oppose any move away from them or steps to dilute them.\"\n\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross meanwhile urged Swinney to \"govern for all of Scotland by abandoning his relentless push for independence\".\n\nRoss insisted his party would seek to \"hold John Swinney to account when he lets the Scottish people down - just as we've done with Humza Yousaf\".\n\nBut the Conservative added: \"It's difficult to see how he can be the fresh start Scotland needs, when he's the ultimate continuity candidate.\n\n\"John Swinney was joined at the hip with the disgraced Nicola Sturgeon and his fingerprints are all over her numerous policy failures and cover-ups.\"\n\nWith Swinney having led the SNP previously between 2000 and 2004, Ross went on to question if a \"failed former leader from two decades ago - who, as education secretary, sent Scotland plummeting down international league tables\" was the best person to lead the country.\n\nHe claimed: \"With John Swinney at the helm, the SNP will double down on their independence obsession - the one issue they agree on - and ignore the real priorities of the Scottish people, such as fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy.\"\n\nsource: PA\n\nCopyright 2024 Alliance News Ltd.

I have sent out a message which is about unifying the SNP to strengthen our party and win Scottish independence.\n\n\"I think that is necessary as the SNP is not as cohesive today as the party needs to be, and my campaign has attracted very wide support.\n\n\"So I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we've had under my leadership and, bluntly, I would just like to get on with that as quickly as I can do because every day that we spend in an internal contest, which I think we all probably know the outcome of, we delay the ability for the SNP to start its rebuilding and I want to get on with that as quickly as I possibly can do.\"\n\nMr Swinney also pointed to the backing he has got from Kate Forbes - the former leadership candidate who lost to Mr Yousaf last year, but had been considering running again.\n\nAsked by Trevor Phillips whether he would appoint her into his government, he said there were \"a couple of hurdles we've got to get over before we get to that\".\n\nRead more:\n\nWho is John Swinney?\n\nHowever, Mr Swinney revealed the pair had spoken, adding: \"I think she's got an important contribution to make to the national life of Scotland.\n\n\"And I've made it clear that she will have a significant role within any government that I have the privilege to lead.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_Kingdom_local_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021 United Kingdom local elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Leadership", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Leadership", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/sky.com/0e8073ca74619ed103a879adbcb1820f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

He ran for party president against Mike Russell in 2023 but lost by 79 votes to 599.\n\nWhen asked who would make the best First Minister from a list of SNP candidates, Mr Swinney and Kate Forbes were neck and neck with the public on 23%, although Ms Forbes has said she will not be standing.\n\nREAD MORE: No Mr Yousaf, Scottish independence is not 'frustratingly close'\n\nStephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, was backed by 7%, and Jenny Gilruth, the Scottish education secretary, scored just 2%.\n\nThe SNP vote share in a Westminster election would fall to its lowest level since the 2014 independence referendum, the poll says.\n\nThe party would hold just 15 of its 43 seats with Scottish Labour winning 28 - a dramatic increase from its current two.\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times poll, the SNP would attract votes from 29% of the electorate - a fall of three points in a month, while Labour's share increased by two points to 34%.\n\nThis would return 15 SNP MPs and amount to a significant reversal in electoral performance.\n\nUnder Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP became the third largest party at Westminster, winning 56 of 59 Scottish seats in 2015. There are currently 43 SNP MPs at Westminster.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives, whose vote share remained at 16% in the poll, would add three seats to return nine MPs - while the Liberal Democrats, on 8%, would boost their yield by one to five MPs.\n\nSupport for independence remains evenly balanced, with 48% in favour of Scotland leaving the UK and 52% backing the Union.\n\nVoting intentions at Holyrood show the SNP remains a point ahead of Labour in the constituency vote at 34%.\n\nThe Conservatives would pick up 14% of the vote, the Lib Dems 9% and the Greens 5% - with the remaining 5% to other parties.\n\nBut Scottish Labour has edged a point ahead of the SNP on the more proportional regional list vote with the latter return of 27%.\n\nThe Tories would win 17% of regional votes, the Greens 9%, Lib Dems 8%, Reform UK 6% and Alex Salmond's Alba Party 4%.\n\nAn analysis by polling expert Sir John Curtice for the Sunday Times found that this result would leave Labour as the largest party at Holyrood with 40 seats.\n\nThe remainder of the chamber would be 38 for the SNP, 24 Conservatives, 10 Greens, nine Lib Dems and eight Reform parliamentarians.\n\nThis would mark a historic breakthrough for Nigel Farage's party in Scotland as it at least partially replicates its gains in England by attracting some older, Brexit-supporting Tories north of the border.\n\nSir John, professor of politics at Strathclyde University - who compiled the seat projections, said the \"question that now arises is whether the coronation of John Swinney will enable the SNP to turn the page\".\n\nHe added: \"Even among those who said they would vote Yes in another independence referendum, only 56% said they were now willing to back the SNP for Westminster, as would only two-thirds who voted for the party in 2019.\"\n\nNorstat interviewed 1,086 people aged 16 or over in Scotland between April 30 and May 3 for the Sunday Times.\n\nSNP depute leader Keith Brown commented: \"After 14 years of cruel Tory governments inflicting endless damage on Scotland and Keir Starmer's Labour offering no meaningful alternative, it's clear only the SNP and independence offers a better future for our country.\n\n\"The SNP is the only party standing up for the priorities of people across Scotland and offering a positive vision for the future where decisions about Scotland are made in Scotland.\n\n\"At the general election Scottish voters have the chance to reject the cosy status quo of a broken Westminster system that is failing them and vote to elect SNP MPs who will always stand up for their interests\".", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type":

John made a terrible job the last time.'\n\nHe also accused Mr Swinney of being part of a 'vicious and brutal marginalisation' of former SNP MSP Margo MacDonald, which led to her becoming an independent MSP.\n\nHe said: 'John is a desperately, desperately weak man and his only way that he can show what he believes is strength is by the total marginalisation of anyone who doesn't think like John.\n\n'John is a direct product of the Standard Life management training organisations. He believes that when you have status everyone else should bow to it, he never ever believes there is a requirement to win respect.\n\n'John thinks when you get a title respect comes with it and that is the sign of a desperately, desperately weak individual.'\n\nThe SNP yesterday declined to confirm how many valid nominations have been received ahead of the close of nominations at noon today.",

opposition party at Holyrood, with a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition in charge.\n\nNow, after holding a variety of senior posts in the Scottish Government, including finance secretary, education secretary and deputy first minister, a position he held for eight years under Nicola Sturgeon, he will get his first chance to be first minister.\n\nConfirmation of Swinney's appointment as party leader comes 25 years to the day after the first elections to the Scottish Parliament with Swinney one of only three MSPs to have held the same seat at Holyrood continuously since then.\n\nWhile Yousaf's downfall was sparked by his decision to terminate the powersharing deal the SNP had had with the Scottish Greens, the smaller pro-independence party urged Swinney not to ditch the \"progressive\" agenda that had been enshrined as part of that arrangement.\n\nScottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie said the party's seven MSPs would meet to discuss how they would vote in the ballot for first minister.\n\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross meanwhile urged Mr Swinney to \"govern for all of Scotland by abandoning his relentless push for independence\".\n\nRoss insisted his party would seek to \"hold John Swinney to account when he lets the Scottish people down - just as we've done with Humza Yousaf\".\n\nBut the Conservative added: \"It's difficult to see how he can be the fresh start Scotland needs, when he's the ultimate continuity candidate.\n\nMeanwhile Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said: \"John Swinney's coronation is entirely about managing the SNP rather than running our country and delivering for Scotland.\n\n\"At a time when Scotland is crying out for change, the SNP is offering more of the same.\n\nJohn Swinney has been at the heart of this incompetent government for 17 years and at the heart of the SNP for 40 years.\n\nSarwar said: \"From presiding over the exam results scandal as education secretary to destroying public finances as finance secretary, John Swinney's record is one of failure.\n\n\"This is a stitch-up by a chaotic and dysfunctional party that is more interested in protecting its own interests than serving the interests of the people of Scotland.\"", "source": {"uri": "thejournal.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheJournal.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "press_association@thejournal.ie", "name":

A path that has led to no success.\n\nRead more: John Swinney wins SNP leadership race\n\nMr Swinney seemed to hint he would ditch Mr Yousaf's strategy of forcing the UK government to begin negotiations for independence if the SNP won the \"most\" seats at a general election.\n\nIt was a plan criticised by some as having no credibility given the polls suggest the party could be on course to lose seats.\n\nMr Swinney says he proposes having a conversation with the public in a bid to persuade those who are not convinced Scotland can be independent.\n\nThe gender-recognition law\n\nOne eye is trained on what the incoming first minister will do with the controversial gender recognition reforms that have been blocked as illegal in the courts.\n\nWhitehall ministers were successful in arguing the Holyrood proposals, which would allow 16-year-olds to apply for a gender recognition certificate without a medical diagnosis, would infringe on UK-wide equality laws.\n\nThe legislation is currently on ice and Mr Swinney will have to decide whether to bin it, given this is a huge source of disunity within the SNP, or tweak the current law and hope it doesn't end up in the courts again.\n\nOn Sunday, he told Sky News he needs to \"consider\" his move.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nHumza Yousaf had barely finished his tearful resignation speech, and the SNP's establishment had already rallied around Mr Swinney.\n\nThere have been questions about what discussions were actually going on in the government engine room as the drama around Mr Yousaf unfolded.\n\nSenior sources say Mr Yousaf made the decision to quit 24 hours before he announced it. The outgoing first minister told me it was \"complete nonsense\" to suggest he was managed out the door in a plot by political colleagues.\n\nAs Mr Yousaf's fate was sealed, Mr Swinney's name was mentioned immediately, and it became clear the party hierarchy had their man.\n\nA significant role for Kate Forbes?\n\nTalks of a Swinney coronation emboldened and angered some in former leadership contender Kate Forbes' camp.\n\nSources close to Ms Forbes were briefing their fury, with suggestions of a \"stitch-up\" on the cards by the \"men in grey suits\".\n\nDays of Holyrood drama followed with banks of cameras, photographers, and journalists pouncing on Ms Forbes and Mr Swinney whenever they were spotted.\n\nMs Forbes, who got almost 50% of the membership vote in the bruising 2023 contest, held an understated level of power.\n\nThere was a sense a contest could be costly, both politically and financially - and frantic, secret discussions were going on to thrash out a deal.\n\nAs late as nine hours before Mr Swinney took to the podium to confirm he was standing to become SNP chief, the Forbes camp was suggesting they hadn't made up their mind.\n\nI had a call from one of her allies at 12.30am. It heightened the sense of jeopardy and power at play.\n\nMr Swinney's speech only mentioned one SNP member by name: Kate Forbes.

It began with a ringing mobile phone.\n\nAt 7.30am on Monday Scotland's first minister and leader of the Scottish National Party, Humza Yousaf, returned a call from Ash Regan, the sole member of the Scottish parliament (MSP) for Alex Salmond's nationalist Alba party. Regan was once an SNP minister and leadership contender, before she defected. She and Yousaf were not close, but on the call she pitched to save his job.\n\nYousaf had spent the weekend trying to rescue his premiership after bungling the ending of the SNP's government partnership with the Scottish Greens, who promised to seek revenge by unseating him in a confidence vote. The Greens rebuffed Yousaf's attempts to patch things up, leaving Alba and the Holyrood vote of Regan as his only route to cling on - the SNP is just short of a majority.\n\nRegan wanted backing for her bill seeking more independence powers for Holyrood and a return to \"competent\" government. She also wanted Yousaf to protect \"the rights of women and children\", code for a tilt away from transgender rights policies popular with the Greens but not with her and many voters. Salmond, in the background, was also hoping the SNP might agree an electoral pact.\n\nThe first minister, guided by the party's establishment, was wary of any deal with Alba and, by extension Salmond, its former leader who left after a bitter falling out with SNP matriarch Nicola Sturgeon. Yousaf accepted his fate. The end of his short stint in power was near.\n\nJournalists were summoned for noon at Bute House, the first minister's official residence in Edinburgh's New Town, 3km from parliament. They were ushered into the drawingroom, now known among Scottish media as the \"resignation room\". Here last February, in front of the fireplace, and weeks before she became embroiled in a financial scandal, Sturgeon had quit as first minister. Now, barely 14 months later, her \"continuity\" successor, Yousaf, did the same.\n\n\"I clearly underestimated the level of hurt and upset my actions caused Green colleagues,\" he admitted. \"While a route through this week's motion of no confidence was absolutely possible, I am not willing to trade my values and principles, or do deals with whomever, simply for retaining power.\"\n\nOver the next few hours senior members of the SNP, including Stephen Flynn, leader of its Westminster group of MPs, urged John Swinney, a party veteran, to replace Yousaf. Later on Monday afternoon, more than 500km away in London where he was at an event marking 25 years of devolution, the softly-spoken Swinney confirmed he was giving the matter \"careful consideration\".\n\nTo many outside the SNP, and a few inside it too, the rush to anoint Swinney smelled of an establishment stitch up. The party is renowned for its \"men in grey kilts\" back room power brokers.\n\n\"What will Kate do?\" wondered many, referring to Kate Forbes, whom Yousaf had narrowly defeated in a brutal leadership contest last year after Sturgeon quit. There was lingering tension between them. She returned to the backbenches where she was viewed as the SNP's next leader-in-waiting.\n\nBy Tuesday morning Forbes had effectively thrown her hat into the ring again when she confirmed she was considering a bid, backed by a few high-profile SNP figures such as MP Joanna Cherry. But while Swinney, who was Sturgeon's deputy, had widespread support among MSPs, Holyrood backing for Forbes was more muted.\n\nMany MSPs were turned off by her aggressive campaign against Yousaf last year, which was sparked by a pile-on against her from senior SNP figures over perceptions of her socially conservative positions on issues around marriage and sex - she is in the evangelical Free Church of Scotland. Yet she remains popular with voters and many ordinary party members, who see her as a new broom.\n\nForbes's main supporters, including MSPs Michelle Thomson and Ivan McKee, hit the airwaves on Tuesday to drum up support. But her main strength lay in polling that showed she was by some distance the most popular potential leader of the SNP with the wider public. The 34-year-old is acknowledged, even by her critics, as probably the most talented politician in the party.\n\nA standoff ensued throughout Tuesday between her camp and Swinney's, but behind the scenes they were in talks. Swinney, sources said, had been assured by party power brokers he would stand unopposed. Forbes had other ideas and if it came to a vote of members might defeat him. Yet if she lost a leadership bid for a second time it could ruin her career.\n\nThroughout Wednesday Forbes kept everybody guessing and word came over that Swinney's camp was nervous. Meanwhile, in Holyrood, MSPs gathered for a confidence vote in the government, due at 2.50pm. It was destined to fail because the Greens would not support it now Yousaf had quit.\n\nMSPs wandered through the Garden Lobby between their offices and the airy parliament chamber wondering what would happen next. \"Nobody wants to see that again,\" said one senior SNP MSP, referring to last year's bitter leadership contest. \"It's an election year. We have to avoid division.\"\n\nAnother SNP MSP told The Irish Times that they believed Forbes should stand aside in favour of Swinney as a unity candidate: \"A lot of us are angry at her over what happened last year. People like her think the party owes her something. It doesn't. It's a time for loyalty.\"\n\nAt 2.30pm on Wednesday a media pack swarmed around Sturgeon in the Garden Lobby as she made a rare appearance at Holyrood - every vote counted in the confidence debate. She refused to back any contenders but warned whomever put their names forward not to talk down other candidates.\n\nA minute later the pack swarmed around Swinney and then Forbes, who both declined to reveal their hands. Inside Holyrood's light-filled chamber the Labour motion to end the government failed but opposition leaders jibed at the SNP over its internal rivalries that were now playing out.\n\nForbes sat directly behind Swinney, almost metaphorically on his shoulder, as she tapped away to somebody on her mobile phone throughout the debate. It seems a deal between her and Swinney was agreed sometimes on Wednesday: she would back down and let him run unopposed.\n\nAt 10.30am on Thursday, Swinney held his campaign launch to formally declare his bid for the SNP leadership at the Grassmarket Community Project in Edinburgh's Old Town. Senior party figures such as cabinet member Angus Robertson sat in the front row. Forbes, who had brought her child to the doctor late the previous evening over a minor incident, watched it live from her Edinburgh flat.\n\nSwinney promised to unify the party. He made a point of praising Forbes publicly and promised her a \"significant role\" in his team. The return of her previous finance portfolio, perhaps?\n\nAt 1.45pm on Thursday Forbes confirmed she would not challenge Swinney and backed him, hinting they had agreed to put the economy at the heart of the SNP's minority government programme. She also suggested that she would continue to speak her own mind in government.\n\n\"It's the dream team,\" texted one elated SNP MSP, who had previously expressed concern to The Irish Times over the possibility of a divisive leadership battle.\n\nNominations remain open until Monday, although it would be a big surprise if another challenger to Swinney emerges. He could be the SNP's new leader by Tuesday morning and soon afterwards Scotland's seventh first minister since devolution in the late 1990s.\n\nHe will lead the SNP into difficult Westminster elections this year, and a knife edge vote for Holyrood in 2026, when it is expected to face a strong challenge from Labour.\n\nForbes, meanwhile, appears destined for a return to Scottish frontline politics and perhaps another tilt at the leadership in future.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Mr McCormick said he had secured the required backing of 100 signatures from 20 different branches to stand.\n\nIn a statement issued on Sunday night, Mr McCormick said he would be supporting Mr Swinney's bid.\n\nThe statement said: \"I'd like to put on record my thanks to John Swinney with whom I had a lengthy and fruitful conversation.\n\n\"John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP, our government and our people face, and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident, as they are advanced, will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months.\n\n\"This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians, and I'm sure that John's determination to deliver independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.\n\n\"I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney's nomination for party leader and First Minister of Scotland.\"\n\nThis means the party has avoided a costly leadership contest. Last year's contest, won by Mr Yousaf, cost \u00a3180,000 - an expense the party would not have wanted in a general election year.\n\nOver the weekend, Mr Swinney told Sky TV: \"Bluntly, I would just like to get on with that as quickly as I possibly can do. Every day we spend on an internal contest, which I think we all probably know the outcome of, we delay the ability of the SNP to start rebuilding.\"\n\nHe also told the BBC: \"Obviously the party has got internal democracy it has got to go through, and nominations close at noon - we will find out then if there are any more candidates than me contesting the election to be the next SNP leader.\n\nScottish politics is never dull - The Steamie newsletter will give you the best analysis\n\n\"But of course it is the democratic right of members of the party to come forward, there are thresholds of support they have to pass, and if it is the case we will have a contest - and I think the overwhelming majority of party members want us to get on with it.\"\n\nThis morning the party's deputy party leader Keith Brown told BBC Good Morning Scotland: \"That's the nature of internal party democracy, it is an open competition.\n\n\"But it is the case that John Swinney is the sole nominee, and having that conversation [with Graeme McCormick] going well shows he can engage with all parts of the party and parliament, which is really important for a minority government.\"", "source": {"uri": "scotsman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scotsman"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_amery@scotsman.com", "name": "Rachel Amery", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deputy First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Party of England and Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2010 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_UK", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky UK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Brown_(Scottish_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keith Brown (Scottish politician)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.scotsman.com/webimg/b25lY21zOjE5MzViNzNhLWYxNmYtNGQzZi1hOTFmLTU2MTJkZTUwNzIyNzoxOTkyYWJjYi02MzA2LTRjNzItYjk5Mi02NDdkN2YwZjFlMzY=.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

deputy first minister, had warned earlier that a contest could damage the party's chances of recovering from a \"difficult\" period.\n\nWith a few hours to go until the nomination deadline closes, Mr Brown said: \"It seems to be that the field is cleaning somewhat and it looks like John Swinney might be the sole nominee.\"\n\nMr Brown described Mr Swinney as the \"biggest hitter in the SNP\" who

she would be offered a \"significant\" job in his team after she confirmed she would not run against him.\n\nAssuming there are no last-minute challengers, the leadership bid will not have to be put to SNP members, with Mr Swinney clear to take over.\n\nHe is likely to become Scotland's next first minister, the third in just over a year, as early as Tuesday.\n\nThe Scottish Government Cabinet will meet on Tuesday, with MSPs later given the opportunity to elect a new first minister at some point in the Holyrood schedule.\n\nMr Swinney would then have to swear three oaths of office at the Court of Session in Edinburgh before officially becoming first minister.\n\nThe leadership race was triggered after Mr Yousaf confirmed his intention to resign last week after he abruptly ended the

We need to stop shouting at each other and talk. More than that, actually, we need to listen. As first minister, I will do exactly that.\"\n\nYousaf announced his resignation last week after a political miscalculation in which he booted the Green Party from the ruling coalition of Scotland's semiautonomous government. The SNP is one seat short of a majority in the local parliament with 63 of the 128 voting seats, so it needs to partner with at least one opposition party.\n\nThe pro-independence SNP was weakened by the campaign finance scandal and divisions over transgender rights, but was ultimately brought down by Yousaf's decision to oust the Greens because of differences over climate change goals. Yousaf was unable to persuade other parties to back his minority government in Scotland's parliament.\n\nFacing the prospect of two no-confidence votes that had been scheduled, Yousaf quit rather than be forced out.\n\nYousaf will remain first minister until his replacement is elected. Swinney is likely to be elected to that position later this week.\n\nSwinney thanked Yousaf for serving with \"grace and dignity,\" and said that his \"moral leadership on the issue of Gaza has been a light in very dark times.\"\n\nYousaf won a bruising campaign to take over the party after Sturgeon, who was first minister for eight years, resigned unexpectedly in February 2023.\n\nAbout a month later, Sturgeon's husband, Peter Murrell, who was the party's chief executive, was arrested as police investigated how 600,000 pounds ($750,000) earmarked for a Scottish independence campaign was spent.\n\nSturgeon and Colin Beattie, the party's former treasurer, were later arrested and questioned in the inquiry, but they were released without being charged with a crime. Murrell was charged last month with embezzlement.\n\nSwinney had served as Sturgeon's deputy first minister during her tenure as Scotland's leader, but stepped down when she left office.\n\nConservative leader Douglas Ross said that Swinney's past makes him unlikely to bring the change that Scotland needs.\n\n\"John Swinney was joined at the hip with the disgraced Nicola Sturgeon and his fingerprints are all over her numerous policy failures and cover-ups,\" Ross said.\n\nSwinney pledged to lead a center-left government focused on the economy, jobs, the cost of living, the National Health Service, schools, public services and the \"climate crisis.\"\n\nSwinney said that he would make his case to persuade people of the need for Scottish independence, which voters rejected in 2014. He cited Brexit and the cost-of-living crisis, which he blamed on U.K. politicians in London, as being bad for Scotland.\n\n\"They demonstrate why Scotland needs to have independence to make our own decisions and create our best future,\" he said. \"If someone is an independence supporter in Scotland and they want Scotland to be independent, there's only one political party that will ever deliver and that's the Scottish National Party.\"\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar echoed Ross' remarks, saying that the \"SNP is offering more of the same.\"\n\n\"John Swinney has been at the heart of this incompetent government for 17 years and at the heart of the SNP for 40 years,\" Sarwar said. \"John Swinney's record is one of failure.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

is set to become Scotland's seventh first minister after winning the SNP leadership unopposed.\n\nThe Perthshire North MSP was announced as Humza Yousaf's successor at noon when nominations closed.\n\nGraeme McCormick, a veteran MSP campaigner, had threatened to run against Swinney at the weekend but later dropped out after holding talks with him.\n\nThe Scottish Parliament is likely to hold a vote to elect Nicola Sturgeon's former deputy as first minister as soon as Tuesday.\n\nSwinney could then be officially sworn in on Wednesday before holding his inaugural First Minister's Questions on Thursday.\n\nA new Cabinet, expected to include former leadership contender Kate Forbes, will also be announced.\n\nIt comes after Yousaf resigned last week a little over a year into his premiership following the bitter ending of his party's power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens.\n\nSwinney will be the third Scottish first minister since the Holyrood elections in 2021.\n\nOpposition parties have called for a national ballot to be held but the fledgling leader has dismissed them, saying that Holyrood is a fixed-term parliament and that it's MSPs who ultimately vote to elect the first minister.\n\nTo be voted through as FM, Swinney - who served under Sturgeon as Scotland's longest-serving deputy first minister - will need the backing of a majority of MSPs, of which the SNP is two short.\n\nWith Scottish Labour, the Tories and the LibDems refusing to back him, he will likely have to rely on the Greens.\n\nCo-leader Patrick Harvie has said his party would be willing to work with a new SNP leader, adding that the problem was with Yousaf, and not the wider Scottish Government.\n\nSwinney, who had previously stepped back from politics when he resigned alongside Sturgeon as her deputy last year, has said he would not be an \"interim leader\" or a \"caretaker\" first minster.\n\nThe SNP stalwart, who was previously leader between 2000 to 2004, said he would lead his party into the next Westminster election, within the next year, and the next Holyrood election in 2026.\n\nHe said he would return the SNP to a more centrist position with a focus on economic growth and social justice.\n\nSwinney becomes SNP leader at a turbulent time for the party.\n\nPolice Scotland's investigation into the party's finances recently led to the former SNP chief executive - and Sturgeon's husband - Peter Murrell being charged with embezzlement last month.\n\nIt had already led to the arrests of Sturgeon and the party's former treasurer Colin Beatie, although both were released pending further investigation.\n\nPolling also suggests that the SNP is on course to win seats at the next election amid a resurgent Labour.", "source": {"uri": "news.stv.tv",

The deadline for nominations is noon on Monday.\n\nMcCormick said he reached the nomination threshold of 100 signatures but chose to back Swinney after a \"lengthy and fruitful conversation\", and said this could be a \"fresh start\".\n\nIn a statement on Sunday night, he said: \"John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP, our government and our people face, and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident, as they are advanced, will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months.\n\n\"This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians, and I'm sure that John's determination to deliver independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.\n\n\"I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney's nomination for party leader and first minister of Scotland.\"\n\nMcCormick's supporters had argued it would have been undemocratic for the party's leader to win an unopposed coronation and insist that Swinney ought to face a contest. He won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP's caution over mounting a second independence referendum without Westminster's approval as \"flatulence in a trance\" during last year's party conference.\n\nOne of McCormick's backers, Iain Lawson, earlier attacked Swinney for criticising the planned challenge, and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and \"raging\" that an ordinary member was going up against him.\n\nSwinney, who described himself as the candidate to unite the party after a \"difficult\" few years, said an election contest would delay the SNP's essential rebuild. But he signalled he would win any potential contest, telling Sky News that party members \"probably know the outcome\" between the two potential candidates.\n\nHis call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland, which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.\n\nThe poll, the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week, put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats, a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15.

We need to stop shouting at each other and talk. More than that, actually, we need to listen. As first minister, I will do exactly that.\"\n\nYousaf announced his resignation last week after a political miscalculation in which he booted the Green Party from the ruling coalition of Scotland's semiautonomous government. The SNP is one seat short of a majority in the local parliament with 63 of the 128 voting seats, so it needs to partner with at least one opposition party.\n\nThe pro-independence SNP was weakened by the campaign finance scandal and divisions over transgender rights, but was ultimately brought down by Yousaf's decision to oust the Greens because of differences over climate change goals. Yousaf was unable to persuade other parties to back his minority government in Scotland's parliament.\n\nFacing the prospect of two no-confidence votes that had been scheduled, Yousaf quit rather than be forced out.\n\nYousaf will remain first minister until his replacement is elected. Swinney is likely to be elected to that position later this week.\n\nSwinney thanked Yousaf for serving with \"grace and dignity,\" and said that his \"moral leadership on the issue of Gaza has been a light in very dark times.\"\n\nYousaf won a bruising campaign to take over the party after Sturgeon, who was first minister for eight years, resigned unexpectedly in February 2023.\n\nAbout a month later, Sturgeon's husband, Peter Murrell, who was the party's chief executive, was arrested as police investigated how 600,000 pounds ($750,000) earmarked for a Scottish independence campaign was spent.\n\nSturgeon and Colin Beattie, the party's former treasurer, were later arrested and questioned in the inquiry, but they were released without being charged with a crime. Murrell was charged last month with embezzlement.\n\nSwinney had served as Sturgeon's deputy first minister during her tenure as Scotland's leader, but stepped down when she left office.\n\nConservative leader Douglas Ross said that Swinney's past makes him unlikely to bring the change that Scotland needs.\n\n\"John Swinney was joined at the hip with the disgraced Nicola Sturgeon and his fingerprints are all over her numerous policy failures and cover-ups,\" Ross said.\n\nSwinney pledged to lead a center-left government focused on the economy, jobs, the cost of living, the National Health Service, schools, public services and the \"climate crisis.\"\n\nSwinney said that he would make his case to persuade people of the need for Scottish independence, which voters rejected in 2014. He cited Brexit and the cost-of-living crisis, which he blamed on U.K. politicians in London, as being bad for Scotland.\n\n\"They demonstrate why Scotland needs to have independence to make our own decisions and create our best future,\" he said. \"If someone is an independence supporter in Scotland and they want Scotland to be independent, there's only one political party that will ever deliver and that's the Scottish National Party.\"\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar echoed Ross' remarks, saying that the \"SNP is offering more of the same.\"\n\n\"John Swinney has been at the heart of this incompetent government for 17 years and at the heart of the SNP for 40 years,\" Sarwar said. \"John Swinney's record is one of failure.\"\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

The new SNP leader, who will become Scotland's seventh First Minister this week, inherits a number of problems both in his party and in the country at large. He will be all too aware of the difficulties ahead.\n\nHis predecessor, Humza Yousaf, never really managed to get on the front foot. Within days of him taking office last year, the police investigation into the SNP's funding and finances exploded into the headlines. It has haunted the party ever since.\n\nMr Swinney will seek to heal internal divisions and boost his party's fortunes in the polls ahead of an expected general election later this year. He has also emphasised the importance of economic growth. So what are the key challenges he faces?\n\nA clear vision\n\nMr Swinney will want to set out a clear strategic direction for his party. This is something his predecessor arguably struggled to do. Mr Yousaf hiked income tax for higher earners at the same time as freezing council tax, which some saw as sending a muddled message.\n\n\"Is this a guy who has demonstrated clear strategic direction?\" asked polling expert Professor Sir John Curtice when I spoke to him last month. \"Answer: no. Increases one set of taxes and reduces another set of taxes.\"\n\nAt his leadership campaign launch last week, Mr Swinney said his goals as First Minister \"will come straight from that moderate centre-left tradition - the pursuit of economic growth and of social justice\".\n\nPolicy rows\n\nMr Swinney referenced the \"curse\" of child poverty, as well as the need to bring people and businesses \"with us\" in the pursuit of net zero.\n\n\"I want ministers to be focused on the delivery of services on which the public depend - on health, on education, on housing, on transport - so people see their lives are getting better as a result of the actions of their government,\" he told supporters last week.\n\nThe Scottish Government has been embroiled in a number of policy rows in recent months. Prof Curtice said SNP ministers have had \"a wee bit, seemingly, of a reverse Midas touch\", adding: \"They cannot stop the mud being stuck on them.\"\n\nWill Mr Swinney seek to steer away from controversial issues such as gender reform and conversion therapy in order to focus resources elsewhere? Polling shows there are real concerns about areas such as health and education in Scotland.\n\nMinority government\n\nFollowing the end of the power-sharing deal between the SNP and the Greens, Mr Swinney will not have a parliamentary majority. This is not necessarily a huge stumbling block - after all, both Alex Salmond and Ms Sturgeon previously presided over minority administrations.\n\nHowever, as Mr Swinney acknowledged, it does mean his party's approach will have to change. The Greens have said they will engage on an \"issue by issue basis\". Depending on what Mr Swinney chooses to pursue, there could be some rocky ground ahead.\n\nGeneral election\n\nThe SNP potentially faces a tough general election in a few months' time. Polls show support for the SNP has slipped, while Labour is on the rise in Scotland. The Rutherglen and Hamilton West by-election last year saw a huge 20.4 per cent swing from the SNP to Labour.\n\nOnce a narrative takes hold in politics, it can be hard to shift. Can Mr Swinney turn things around?\n\nParty unity\n\nAt his leadership launch, Mr Swinney said the SNP \"is not as cohesive\" as it needs to be.\n\n\"I could have stood back and hoped others would sort things out,\" he said. \"But I care too much about the future of Scotland and the Scottish National Party to walk on by. Just as we must fight against the polarisation of our politics, we cannot allow the SNP to be polarised.\"\n\nThe modern SNP was once renowned for its iron discipline, but divisions have been increasingly apparent in recent years. Figures such as Joanna Cherry, the high-profile MP, and Fergus Ewing, the former minister who is now a backbench rebel, have been outspoken critics of the party's leadership.\n\nGender reform and the SNP's power-sharing deal with the Greens were both sources of controversy. But there have also been disagreements over independence strategy, as well as a wider dissatisfaction in some quarters with the direction of the party.\n\nMr Swinney recognises he will need to \"bring the SNP back together again\".\n\nIndependence\n\nMr Yousaf's independence strategy was an unrealistic compromise designed to appease the restless factions within his own party. Under his plan, winning a majority of Scottish seats at the general election would have given the SNP a mandate to push for a second independence referendum.\n\nIn reality, neither Labour nor the Tories would have agreed to this.\n\nMr Swinney has instead stressed the need to build public support. \"What I think our priority has got to be, is to spend less time discussing the mechanics and the thresholds about independence, but to start winning the arguments about why independence is an absolute necessity for people in Scotland,\" he said over the weekend.\n\nHe rejected Mr Yousaf's claim that independence is \"frustratingly close\". But will SNP members lose patience if progress remains stalled?\n\nOperation Branchform\n\nThen there's the ongoing police investigation into the SNP's funding and finances.\n\nMr Murrell was arrested for a second time last month and charged with embezzlement of SNP funds. Party insiders are naturally braced for any further police activity.\n\nUntil the probe is brought to a close, it will continue to cast a shadow over the party.", "source": {"uri": "scotsman.com",

Swinney's election after nominations for the post closed at 12 noon (1100 GMT) without any other challengers emerging.\n\nHumza stepped down last Monday as he faced a confidence vote in the Scottish parliament that he was set to lose having ditched his junior coalition partners, the Scottish Green Party, in a row over climate policy.\n\nSwinney is likely to become the next first minister, head of the devolved Scottish government, but will still need enough votes in the Scottish parliament to be elected first minister.\n\nLaunching his bid last week, Swinney said he was running \"to unite the SNP and unite Scotland for independence\", despite polls showing stalled support for a split from the UK.\n\n\"I want to build on the work of the SNP government to create a modern, diverse, dynamic Scotland that will ensure opportunity for all of our citizens,\" Swinney told supporters in Edinburgh.\n\nSwinney inherits a difficult political legacy with former SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon embroiled in a party funding scandal and a challenging domestic policy landscape.\n\nWith the SNP heading a minority government in the 129-seat Scottish parliament, he will need the support of another party to

SNP leader - and likely new Scottish...", "body": "John Swinney, who was for over eight years deputy first minister at Holyrood, now seems certain to take on the top job in Scottish politics.\n\nBut as first minister he is sure to face a bulging in-tray, packed with issues to address, when he enters Bute House.\n\nPerhaps the first task facing him in his new role will be to appoint the cabinet team who will support him as part of the Scottish Government.\n\nA veteran of the Scottish Government since the SNP, Mr Swinney has already held many of the key posts, including having served as finance secretary, and education secretary, so will know what is expected of those he appoints to serve under him.\n\nA new Scottish cabinet could be announced as early as Thursday, with all eyes on what post could be given to Kate Forbes, who like Mr Swinney has previously been in charge of the finance brief for the Scottish Government.\n\nShe had ran to be SNP leader and first minister when Nicola Sturgeon stepped down, coming a close second to Humza Yousaf.\n\nSNP MSP Kate Forbes is expected to get a top role (Jane Barlow/PA)\n\nThis time round however she declined to stand, instead backing Mr Swinney and appointing her to a key post in the Scottish Government could also help the new SNP leader with another task he faced, that of uniting his party.\n\nMs Forbes is amongst a group of SNP MSPs who have spoken out against several of the policies pursued and promoted by the Scottish Greens while in government, such as gender recognition reforms, which were blocked by Westminster, and highly protected marine areas, a policy which was ditched by the Scottish Government after attracting criticism from the fishing sector and others.\n\nWhile Ms Forbes refused to serve in Mr Yousaf's cabinet team, bringing her back into the heart of government could help appease those within the SNP who had been concerned about the role the Greens played in power.\n\nWith the powersharing agreement with the Greens no longer in place, Mr Swinney will be forced to lead a minority government at Holyrood.\n\nAs part of this role he will have to work with other parties in the Scottish Parliament on an issue by issue basis if he wants legislation to be passed by Holyrood.\n\nHe acknowledged this when he announced he was running for the SNP leadership, saying his party must now \"work to seek common ground in the Scottish Parliament in the interests of the public and of good governance\".\n\nMr Swinney added that as a result, the party's approach in Holyrood would \"have to change, to listen, to compromise, to work with all other political parties\".\n\nAs new SNP leader he will have lead his party in what could likely prove to be a difficult general election campaign later this year.\n\nPolls suggest the SNP could lose seats at Westminster, with the party facing a challenge from a revived Scottish Labour Party in the battle for votes.\n\nMeanwhile his appointment comes as the Police Scotland probe into the SNP's finances continues, with the new party leader also having to deal with any further political fallout from that.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

party's depute leader has claimed.\n\nKeith Brown said the \"field is clearing\" as it is expected that Mr Swinney will run unopposed and be confirmed as SNP leader later on Monday.\n\nNominations close at noon in the race to replace Humza Yousaf as the leader of the SNP.\n\nThere were reports of a potential contest on Sunday when activist Graeme McCormick said he had the secured 100 nominations from 20 branches needed to run against Mr Swinney.\n\nBut later on Sunday, he confirmed he had backed out of the campaign after \"lengthy and fruitful\" conversations with Mr Swinney.\n\nMr Swinney, a former deputy first minister, had warned earlier that a contest could damage the party's chances of recovering from a \"difficult\" period.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland radio programme, Mr Brown said it is important to respect the SNP's democratic processes.\n\nWith a few hours to go until the nomination deadline closes, Mr Brown said: \"It seems to be that the field is cleaning somewhat and it looks like John Swinney might be the sole nominee.\"\n\nMr Brown described Mr Swinney as the \"biggest hitter in the SNP\" who would scare unionist parties \"to a great extent\".\n\nHe continued: \"I also understand over the course of the weekend, of course, we've people out canvassing and they've reported already an increase in positive turnout coming back from those canvassing sessions.\n\n\"So there's been an immediate lift from the discussions which John Swinney has had first of all with Kate Forbes and, it now appears, with Graeme McCormick.\"\n\nIt was also initially thought that former finance secretary Ms Forbes would contest the leadership, but Mr Swinney heaped praised on his potential rival, saying she would be offered a \"significant\" job in his team after she confirmed she would not run against him.\n\nAssuming there are no last-minute challengers, the leadership bid will not have to be put to SNP members, with Mr Swinney clear to take over.\n\nHe is likely to become Scotland's next first minister, the third in just over a year, as early as Tuesday.\n\nThe Scottish Government Cabinet will meet on Tuesday, with MSPs later given the opportunity to elect a new first minister at some point in the Holyrood schedule.\n\nMr Swinney would then have to swear three oaths of office at the Court of Session in Edinburgh before officially becoming first minister.\n\nThe leadership race was triggered after Mr Yousaf confirmed his intention to resign last week after he abruptly ended the powersharing agreement with the Scottish Greens, facing significant backlash in Holyrood and a vote of no confidence in his leadership.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

I am no interim leader.\n\n\"I am offering to lead my party through the Westminster elections and to lead us beyond the 2026 elections -- two contests which I intend to win for the SNP, and for Scotland.\n\n\"My message is crisp and simple: I am stepping forward to bring the SNP together, deliver economic growth and social justice, and to deliver the very best future for everyone in a modern, dynamic, diverse Scotland.\"\n\nQuestioned on Ms Forbes's leadership ambitions, Mr Swinney praised her as \"intelligent, creative, thoughtful person who has much to contribute.\"\n\nHe added: \"If elected, I will make sure Kate is able to make that contribution.\"\n\nJust hours later, and a day after they met for talks, Ms Forbes announced she would not spark a repeat of last year's bruising leadership battle by throwing her hat into the ring.\n\nShe said: \"In John Swinney we have someone who not only understands that need for reform, but has now committed to delivering it.\n\n\"I look forward to playing my role in making that happen.\"", "source": {"uri": "morningstaronline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Morning Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

"Edinburgh (AFP): Scottish political veteran John Swinney on Monday was named head of the pro-independence SNP party, leaving him poised to become Scotland's new leader.\n\nSwinney, 60, said on X, formerly Twitter, he was \"deeply honoured to have been elected as leader of the SNP\" after Humza Yousaf resigned last week after little more than a year as Scottish leader and head of the Scottish National Party (SNP).\n\nThe SNP confirmed Swinney's election after nominations for the post closed at noon (1100 GMT) without any other challengers emerging.\n\nHumza stepped down last Monday as he faced a confidence vote in the Scottish parliament that he was set to lose having ditched his junior coalition partners, the Scottish Green Party, in a row over climate policy.\n\nSwinney is likely to become the next First Minister, head of the devolved Scottish government, but will still need enough votes in the Scottish parliament to be elected first minister.\n\nLaunching his bid last week, Swinney said he was running \"to unite the SNP and unite Scotland for independence\", despite polls showing stalled support for a split from the UK.\n\n\"I want to build on the work of the SNP government to create a modern, diverse, dynamic Scotland that will ensure opportunity for all of our citizens,\" Swinney told supporters in Edinburgh.\n\nSwinney is an old party hand who led the SNP from 2000 to 2004 when the party was in opposition.\n\nBut he inherits a difficult political legacy, with former SNP leader and ally Nicola Sturgeon embroiled in a party funding scandal and a challenging domestic policy landscape.\n\n- Loss of momentum -\n\nCritics have accused the SNP, in power in Edinburgh for 17 years, of focusing on pursuing independence at the expense of issues like the cost-of-living crisis and health.\n\nThe party has struggled to rebuild momentum for another independence vote since Scotland voted against leaving the UK in a referendum in 2014.\n\nSupport for independence, meanwhile, has since fallen to between 41 and 43 percent, according to three opinion polls taken in April.\n\nWith the SNP heading a minority government in the 129-seat Scottish parliament, Swinney will need the support of another party to form a governing coalition or to pass legislation.\n\nThe government is currently two votes short of an overall majority, only surviving the no-confidence vote brought by the Labour opposition last week thanks to the backing of the Greens.\n\nThe ructions in the SNP are being closely watched in London, ahead of a UK general election later this year.\n\nThe SNP currently holds 43 seats in the UK parliament.\n\nThe UK's main Labour opposition is hoping for a resurgence in its former stronghold north of the English border to help it win an outright majority in the general election.\n\nThe Scottish Parliament, re-established in 1999, has limited powers to set policy in areas such as health, education, transport and the environment.\n\nThe UK government in London retains powers for countrywide issues such as defence and foreign policy.", "source": {"uri": "thefrontierpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

That they were not to be tainted by events which could soon be revealed in court.\n\nThey have chosen not to do so, and by choosing John Swinney, their seamless transition to fresh government instead becomes a seamless join with a running sore that continues to damage the SNP. From Sturgeon, to Yousaf, to Swinney. As Eric Morecambe used to say: \"You can't see the join!\"\n\nIn depriving the membership of the party a say in selecting who their leader should be, they have continued in the vein of Nicola Sturgeon, centralising decision-making to as few people as possible. Humza Yousaf was to the SNP what Liz Truss was to the Tories, and he has now been replaced by their equivalent of John Major. Swinney is undoubtedly Scotland's dullest and least inspiring politician, and for those of us who remember his last spell as leader, he brings with him an expectation of loss.\n\nREAD MORE: Patrick Harvie speaks out after end of Bute House Agreement\n\nWith an impending Westminster election and a Holyrood election soon after, I can think of no worse choice that the SNP leadership could have imposed on the party. On BBC Debate Night, Neil Gray MSP, campaign manager for Humza Yousaf, said he had endorsed Humza Yousaf because he was the right man for the job, and in his opinion, he had been a good first minister. He then went on to say that in his opinion Swinney was the right man for the job. Fool me twice, shame on me, as they say.\n\nThe whole process in which Humza Yousaf departed office raises more questions than it answers. Surely I can't be alone in thinking that the decision to end the Bute House Agreement with the Greens was not a decision made my Yousaf alone, above the heads of his Cabinet, and without their endorsement?\n\nIf Neil Gray, as he said, worked hard to convince him to stay as first minister, why was he railroaded out by the rest of the Cabinet? One vote from Alba would have saved him and the Scottish Government from the votes of no confidence they faced, yet the SNP made it clear that they would refuse to countenance such an offer. One has to remember that probably 95% of the Alba Party membership are former SNP members, and while they are disappointed in the party's failure to progress independence, they recognise that the SNP are at present still the major party of independence, and as such will support them to achieve that goal.\n\nI find it bizarre that Scotland's second largest independence party's offer of help was rejected outright, in order to cut a backroom deal with the Greens, who the SNP, not Humza Yousaf alone, threw out of government. Clearly there has been a recognition at some level that a continued joint government was not in their interest, and the rejection of Alba over the Greens again indicates no change in direction from the party.\n\nIt's akin to when Marathon rebranded to Snickers. The label changed but the nuts remain.\n\nREAD MORE: SNP activist seeking to challenge John Swinney for party leadership\n\nWhen the Greens asked that Labour withdraw their vote of no confidence it was quite clear to every man and his dog that a deal had been done, and that the Scottish Government was safe. The vote was, by that point, pointless. Knowing that the government was safe, Ash Regan of Alba then knew that she could cast her vote of no confidence without actually ending up being the scapegoat for bringing it down.\n\nUnfortunately, this was manna from heaven for those on the more tinfoil-hatted wing of the SNP, who saw this as evidence that Alba are an MI5 construct, and all the members are secret British Nationalists. These members are, of course, the same folk who used to attend branch meetings and conferences alongside them, and who chapped doors and delivered leaflets in all weathers with them.\n\nA more sensible approach from Regan would have been to abstain, sending the message that she could not endorse them, but ultimately neither would she bring down a Scottish Nationalist government in favour of a British Nationalist one. That opportunity has been lost, and it may now be harder for Alba to reach across to the SNP membership, something that they need to do in the next Holyrood election.\n\nThere is more that unites us than divides us, and as someone who has not forgotten that independence is our ultimate goal, which I want to see sooner, not later, I must ask all our independence supporting politicians to focus on that goal in every act that they do. All our politicians have fallen into the trap of focusing on election cycles, when what we need to do is break the electoral system. We are being told by London that we cannot have a referendum. Good governance brings the confidence to take more responsibility, and we can bypass any referendum by having all independence parties stating, clear and simple, that a vote for them is a vote to declare independence, not to seek permission which will always be refused. It's time to put country before career.\n\nSome people think that a spell out of office is required to refocus, regroup and reorganise. This is akin to football supporters facing relegation, who convince themselves that after a season in the lower leagues, they will come back bigger and stronger. This is seldom the case, and for many teams, that season becomes an extended period in the wilderness. We can only hope that Swinney can salvage something in time for the elections, because the Yes movement cannot afford a loss in any way, shape or form. Relegation is not an option.\n\nJUST as I suspected after the not so secret meeting between John Swinney and Kate Forbes, no sooner had Swinney come out of it than he was stating that yes, he would stand in the \"hardly a race\" to be First Minister.\n\nSoon after, we read of Kate Forbes's agreement with just about everything John Swinney is standing for to become first minister. Now, we read that he has promised Kate a senior role in his government if/when elected.\n\nIt was my guess that this would have happened. Further, it was my reasoning that Forbes would also be promised the deputy first minister job for the interim and until the next Scottish election. Thus giving her the opportunity to become the first minister if the SNP won another term in government.\n\nHowever, John Swinney has not gone that far yet publicly, except to say that a \"senior\" post will be on offer based on her being an \"intelligent, creative, thoughtful person\". Enough said? Quite possibly!\n\nAs stated in my earlier letter, I would like to see Kate Forbes in a senior position whatever that might be, having voted for her in the last first ministerial race subsequent to Nicola Sturgeon's resignation.\n\nThe next two years of Scottish government could be quite interesting. So far as independence is concerned, it looks as if it will be up to us, the sovereign people. A \"people's convention\" would be a good start. The Yes movement doesn't need reinvigorating as suggested by Forbes.\n\nIt is the SNP government that needs invigorating.\n\nFIRSTLY, I would like to wish Humza and his family, which will be increasing in size in due course, all the very best for the future. He always seemed to me to be a thoroughly decent human, being among some other politicians in Holyrood who, in my view, are nothing of the sort! I backed Humza and the Bute House Agreement (BHA) from day one and personally feel so sad about how recent events transpired.\n\nDuring the period after Humza ended the BHA, but before he resigned, I watched an interview Alex Salmond did on the telly. In it, as usual, he slagged off the Greens. Then he said something that nearly made me fall off the sofa. He\n\nsaid Ash Regan was the \"adult in the room\", obviously compared to the Greens and no doubt her detractors within the SNP!\n\nSorry, Alex, you are clearly an intelligent man, but folk with the right type of intelligence - and that is the vital bit - realise that this planet we inhabit is in serious dire straits and urgent, drastic action is required to deal with the crisis. The Greens, not you or Ash, totally get that. In my book, therefore, that easily makes them the real adults in the room!\n\nI read that there was a poll of SNP voters and 60% of them were disappointed by the breakdown of the BHA and I'm definitely one of them. It seemed like anything the Greens proposed to combat climate change while in government was shot down in flames by all and sundry throughout Scotland, except those on the left of the SNP and environmental campaigners.\n\nThey never stood a chance and I definitely don't blame Green politicians or members of their party getting totally frustrated in the end!\n\nI feel this is an opportune time to deal with the elephant in the room. Many, myself included, thought it was a good thing that Humza became the first Muslim and person of colour to become Scotland's First Minister. However, Humza had a hurdle to deal with that none of his predecessors experienced.\n\nThe vehemence some showed towards him right from the off was very suspicious, in my view. I don't doubt for one minute that this was due, in some instances, to sheer racism and/or Islamophobia. I don't believe such sentiment is merely confined to some individuals in Scottish cricket, for example, as has been well publicised over recent years. It's a problem that has never gone away. Just ask those that have been victims of it throughout their lives, including Humza, of course.\n\nOn a lighter note, I know one thing. If the choice for the next leader of the SNP puts a smile on the faces of Alex Salmond, Ash Regan and Fergus Ewing then I'll definitely be greetin'!\n\nLIKE Lesley Riddoch, I am very disappointed that the grassroots who tramp the staircases year in, year out are not getting the chance to hear the candidates' vision for the SNP - but also, and equally important, for Scotland and its people. It's quite obvious a deal has been done and now we'll never know. SHAME.\n\nENGLISH Labour's Viceroy-in-waiting Ian Murray wants an election now. He slams the Scottish administration's record but doesn't say that Scotland not only has the UK's best-performing NHS but has avoided strikes while the English NHS has had almost continual strikes since 2022.\n\nAnd look at Labour-run Wales. The new Welsh Labour leader accepted \u00a3200k from a company owned by a man prosecuted for illegally dumping waste, the Welsh NHS isn't functional according to the Welsh BMA head and 80% of Welsh GPs complain of excessive workloads putting patients at risk. But you won't hear Ian Murray calling for a Welsh election.\n\nThen we have yet another English Labour U-turn, this time a rollback of workers' rights. Starmer says he won't end employers' use of \"fire and rehire\", won't raise sick pay, won't reverse anti-strike legislation and won't ban zero-hours contracts. This makes a complete mockery of English Labour's northern manager Anas Sarwar's promise to \"always be on the side of working people across Scotland.\"\n\nBut we know whose side English Labour is really on - the side of its corporate donors who, the FT reports, are really now \"quite relaxed\" about Labour's plans.\n\nThere's no way English Labour will deliver anything positive for Scotland. There won't be a return to the Single Market and despite saying the union is 'voluntary', Sir Keir says Scotland has no democratic way out and no right to self-determination.\n\nWhat Scotland needs now, Ian, is an end to our nation's exploitation and subjugation by its larger \"partner\".\n\n\"THE governance of any country cannot simply be a revolving door that one party gets to pick time and time again who occupies the highest office in the land.\"\n\nThese were the words of Nicola Sturgeon after the defenestration of Liz Truss by Rishi Sunak. Now that the unimpressive John Swinney is to be the 3rd SNP leader in a year, the charge against them is rank hypocrisy.\n\nThe Swinney Coronation will be viewed (correctly) as yet another stitch-up by the Sturgeon faction. All so the talentless bottom feeders promoted by Sturgeon/Murrell can continue to be paid generous expenses and wages by the public purse.\n\nUnder Sturgeon, the SNP ceased to be a party of independence. She may have said they were pursuing independence, but this was transparent nonsense. Her actions showed she was firmly a closet Unionist.\n\nThese unprincipled grifters sought and got mandates for a referendum in 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2021. During this time, the UK government had to deal with Brexit, Covid-19, and the invasion of Ukraine. The Prime Ministers were Boris Johnson and Liz Truss.\n\nIt is hard to imagine more felicitous circumstances. Yet the unscrupulous charlatan Sturgeon managed to blow it. It was all about her. A personality cult was built up. No opposition was tolerated. The SNP is now paying for the insecurity and imposter syndrome of its ex-leader.\n\nAll that was forthcoming were extremely unpopular lunatic \"gender\" policies that made science denial an actual crime.\n\nWhen Humza Yousaf was elected, I said his record in health, justice, and transport was an indicator he wouldn't last as FM.\n\nThe same will apply to Swinney. His record of failure is even greater than that of the hapless Yousaf.\n\nThe Alba MSP Ash Regan has a bill on the table. This would be for a referendum on the power to hold a referendum. It would be legally tight. The SNP woke faction refused to endorse this reasonable proposal. This yet again exposes them as Devomax fraudsters.\n\nA John Swinney government at Holyrood seals the fate of independence. Nothing will occur for at least a decade, maybe more. This is the legacy of the toxic Sturgeon and her gullible cult. The only way to get independence back on the agenda is to elect actual independence supporters to Holyrood.", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"},

He said Scotland could \"do more\" with the powers of independence and that he would \"always seek\" to persuade people of that.\n\nDespite that, the topic took a back seat to other issues.\n\n\"If elected first minister, my focus will be the economy, jobs, the cost of living,\" the 60-year-old told attending party members, staff and journalists. \"It will be the NHS, our schools and our public services. It will be addressing the climate crisis,\"\n\nREAD MORE: John Swinney backs Humza Yousaf's Scottish independence strategy\n\nBringing an end to his speech, Swinney went on: \"Join me as we open a new chapter. As we create a vibrant economy in every part of our country. As we tackle the challenges faced by the NHS. As we build on the strengths of our schools. As we build more homes. Take climate action. Improve public transport. And create jobs.\"\n\nIn both instances, no mention of independence - which was a stark omission. Instead, the veteran politician particularly highlighted the need for internal party unity and focusing on domestic policy priorities.\n\nOf course, Swinney's focus on unity makes a lot of sense. Nothing can be built on shaky foundations and bringing in a figure with the experience of Swinney should steady the ship.\n\nThe longest-serving deputy first minister the Scottish Parliament has ever seen and a past SNP leader between 2000-2004, \"been there, done that\" springs to mind.\n\nAlready, his move to commit to bringing Kate Forbes more into the fold should go some way in bringing together the left and right of the party. Swinney also said in his speech that he believes the fact he was the only candidate to stand demonstrates the SNP is \"coming back together again\".\n\nWhile the power-sharing agreement with the Greens no longer in place, Swinney will need all that experience as he is forced to lead a minority government at Holyrood.\n\nHe will have to work with other parties in the Scottish Parliament on an issue by issue basis if he wants legislation to be passed by Holyrood.\n\nHe acknowledged as much in his speech.\n\n\"We need to stop shouting at each other and talk,\" he said.\n\nAnd when he first announced he was running for the SNP leadership, Swinney added that his party must now \"work to seek common ground in the Scottish Parliament in the interests of the public and of good governance\".\n\nThat the likes of Scottish Labour and the Scottish Tories will take up that offer of a more civil and collaborative politics rather than attempting to turn the screw - particularly going into a General Election - seems unlikely though, particularly when the former continues to call for an early Holyrood election.\n\nWith the Scottish Greens, they should still find a willing partner on most issues. This is particularly the case on proposed legislation - from the Fair Rents (Scotland) Bill to bans on conversion therapy - which was put forward during their time in government.\n\nTime might be the most pressing issue the new SNP leader is faced with. While a date has yet to have been set, the General Election is approaching with the polls putting Labour and the SNP neck and neck.\n\nSwinney has the tough task to unite his party and place emphasis on the SNP's domestic policy priorities AND work \"very, very hard\" to win back independence supporters. And the latter may prove the most decisive come General Election time.\n\n\"Scotland wins when the SNP wins,\" Swinney said in his speech.\n\nBut the SNP also wins when indy supporters are firmly behind the party.", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Glasgow", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Glasgow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party\u2013Scottish_Greens_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party\u2013Scottish Greens agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deputy First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestic policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Labour", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conversion therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Highland_Games", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Highland Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.thenational.scot/resources/images/17772724/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

previously been critical of the SNP-led Scottish Government, using last year's party conference to criticise the party's independence strategy.\n\nIf he won the leadership race against Swinney, he would not be able to become first minister as he is not elected in the Scottish Parliament, with McCormick reportedly telling members he believes the roles should be run by two different individuals.\n\nHowever, Swinney told the Sky News programme Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips that he felt an internal contest would hamper the SNP's ability to recover from its turbulent period quickly.\n\nGraeme McCormick is seeking to run in the SNP leadership contest (Image: Archive)\n\nHe said: \"I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we have had, under my leadership, and bluntly, I'd just like to get on with that as quickly as I possible can do, because every day that we spend in an internal contest, which I think we all probably know the outcome of, we delay the possibility for the SNP to start its rebuilding.\"\n\nSwinney told the programme his leadership bid had received \"very, very comprehensive support\", including from former finance secretary Kate Forbes, who earlier ruled herself out of the contest.\n\nShould McCormick receive the required nominations, a three-week leadership contest will be triggered, with ballots opening on Monday May 13 and closing on May 27.\n\nBut if Swinney runs unopposed, he will be the next SNP leader and he will likely become first minister as early as next week after a Holyrood vote.\n\nREAD MORE: SNP activist seeking to challenge John Swinney for party leadership\n\nSwinney, who previously led his party from 2000 to 2004, faced a leadership challenge from an activist in

\"I think it would be better if we just got on with things, that we started the rebuilding of the SNP and its political strength.\"\n\nHe added he thought the \"overwhelming majority\" of party members \"wanted to get on with it\".\n\nAsked where the party \"disunity\" came from, he cited the leadership contest in 2023, which saw Humza Yousaf, Kate Forbes and Ash Regan engage in occasionally bruising debates on social issues and independence strategy.\n\n\"I think we have basically just had a rough couple of years,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType": "news",

As first minister, I will do exactly that.\"\n\nYousaf announced his resignation last week after a political miscalculation in which he booted the Green Party from the ruling coalition of Scotland's semiautonomous government. The SNP is one seat short of a majority in the local parliament with 63 of the 128 voting seats, so it needs to partner with at least one opposition party.\n\nThe pro-independence SNP was weakened by the campaign finance scandal and divisions over transgender rights, but was ultimately brought down by Yousaf's decision to oust the Greens because of differences over climate change goals. Yousaf was unable to persuade other parties to back his minority government in Scotland's parliament.\n\nFacing the prospect of two no-confidence votes that had been scheduled, Yousaf quit rather than be forced out.\n\nYousaf will remain first minister until his replacement is elected. Swinney is likely to be elected to that position later this week.\n\nSwinney thanked Yousaf for serving with \"grace and dignity,\" and said that his \"moral leadership on the issue of Gaza has been a light in very dark times.\"\n\nYousaf won a bruising campaign to take over the party after Sturgeon, who was first minister for eight years, resigned unexpectedly in February 2023.\n\nAbout a month later, Sturgeon's husband, Peter Murrell, who was the party's chief executive, was arrested as police investigated how 600,000 pounds ($750,000) earmarked for a Scottish independence campaign was spent.\n\nSturgeon and Colin Beattie, the party's former treasurer, were later arrested and questioned in the inquiry, but they were released without being charged with a crime. Murrell was charged last month with embezzlement.\n\nSwinney had served as Sturgeon's deputy first minister during her tenure as Scotland's leader, but stepped down when she left office.\n\nConservative leader Douglas Ross said that Swinney's past makes him unlikely to bring the change that Scotland needs.\n\n\"John Swinney was joined at the hip with the disgraced Nicola Sturgeon and his fingerprints are all over her numerous policy failures and cover-ups,\" Ross said.\n\nSwinney pledged to lead a center-left government focused on the economy, jobs, the cost of living, the National Health Service, schools, public services and the \"climate crisis.\"\n\nSwinney said that he would make his case to persuade people of the need for Scottish independence, which voters rejected in 2014. He cited Brexit and the cost-of-living crisis, which he blamed on U.K. politicians in London, as being bad for Scotland.\n\n\"They demonstrate why Scotland needs to have independence to make our own decisions and create our best future,\" he said. \"If someone is an independence supporter in Scotland and they want Scotland to be independent, there's only one political party that will ever deliver and that's the Scottish National Party.\"\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar echoed Ross' remarks, saying that the \"SNP is offering more of the same.\"\n\n\"John Swinney has been at the heart of this incompetent government for 17 years and at the heart of the SNP for 40 years,\" Sarwar said. \"John Swinney's record is one of failure.\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType":

not mean John Swinney will automatically become Scotland's next first minister.\n\nFor that to happen the former deputy first minister has to face a vote in the Scottish Parliament, where he will need to win the support of MSPs.\n\nIt is likely other party leaders could put themselves forward for the ballot, though it is in reality unlikely that they would be successful in this.\n\nHowever for Mr Swinney to win the vote in Holyrood, which could take place as early as Wednesday, he will need some MSPs from opposition parties to either back him in the vote, or at least abstain.\n\nThat is because without the powersharing deal with the Scottish Greens, which was ripped up by Humza Yousaf, the SNP is short of an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament.\n\nThe support of Scottish Greens therefore could still be crucial going forward, in this vote and in others to come at Holyrood.\n\nAssuming he wins the vote, Mr Swinney will then become the Scottish Parliament's nominated candidate to be the country's seventh first minister.\n\nAfter that he would be formally appointed via a royal warrant, a legal document that is authorised by the King.\n\nFollowing that he would officially be sworn into the post in a ceremony at the Court of Session in Edinburgh by the Lord President, Scotland's most senior judge.\n\nThat could happen on Thursday morning with Mr Swinney then potentially going on to take First Minister's Questions for the first time in the new role at noon the same day.\n\nHe will also have to appoint his his ministerial team of cabinet secretaries and junior ministers, with much attention on what position will go to Kate Forbes.\n\nThe former Holyrood finance secretary had been tipped as a possible challenger to Mr Swinney for the SNP leadership, but announced on Thursday she would not stand and would instead back the former deputy first minister in his bid for the top job.\n\nMr Swinney, in announcing his candidacy sought to praise Ms Forbes, who last year ran Mr Yousaf a close second in the contest to succeed Nicola Sturgeon, and giving her a top post in his cabinet team would be seen as a move towards restoring unity within the different factions of the SNP.\n\nMs Forbes has been out of the Scottish cabinet since then, but could return to a senior post under Mr Swinney.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

It now heads a minority government in Holyrood.\n\nThe slide has boosted the hopes of Britain's opposition Labour Party of regaining ground in Scotland, one of the UK's four nations, as it seeks to win a British parliamentary election expected later this year.\n\nThe SNP aims to reinvigorate the push for another referendum on independence from the UK.\n\nScots voted against splitting from the UK

He seeks to revitalize the party's fortunes and lead Scotland towards independence.Scotland's likely next leader John Swinney is a political veteran who will have to unify his fractured separatist party and revitalise its flagging independence movement.\n\nThe 60-year-old belongs, named Monday as the new Scottish National Party (SNP) leader, is part of the party's old guard.\n\nHe is also an ally of tarnished ex-first minister Nicola Sturgeon, whom he served as deputy for a record nine years.\n\nSwinney is viewed as a calm head capable of stabilising Scotland's ruling party following 39-year-old Humza Yousaf's turbulent leadership and repairing its broken relationship with former power-sharing partners the Greens.\n\nBut detractors say Swinney -- who has led the party before -- represents more of the same, and is damaged by his defence of former boss Sturgeon, who was arrested in an ongoing party finances scandal.\n\n\"He could hardly be closer to the now discredited Sturgeon leadership so distancing himself from that will be a challenge,\" Edinburgh University politics professor James Mitchell told AFP.\n\n\"(But) Swinney is the ultimate party man, loyal to a fault. He is very well liked in the SNP because of this.\"\n\nBorn in Edinburgh in April 1964, Swinney joined the SNP when he was 15, quickly rising through its ranks and becoming national secretary in the mid-1980s.\n\nHe first became a lawmaker in 1997 when he was elected to the UK parliament in London to represent a constituency in Tayside, in the heart of Scotland.\n\nTwo years later, he was elected to Scotland's regional parliament at Holyrood in Edinburgh when it was re-established after more than 300 years, with Labour at the helm.\n\nSwinney first became SNP leader in September 2000 following the departure of Alex Salmond.\n\nBut he endured a torrid four years in charge as the SNP's fortunes slumped during the early days of Scotland's devolved parliament and the height of New Labour mania under UK prime minister Tony Blair.\n\nDespite an expenses scandal forcing then-Labour first minister Henry McLeish from office in 2001, the opposition SNP still lost several seats at Holyrood in the 2003 Scottish parliamentary election.\n\nSwinney saw off a leadership contest from an SNP activist but was forced to step down after a dismal showing at the 2004 European Parliament elections.\n\n- 'Unite' -\n\nHis political career enjoyed a rebirth in 2007 when the SNP, then under the leadership of Salmond again, became the largest party at Holyrood and Swinney became finance minister.\n\nHe became deputy first minister in 2014 after Sturgeon succeeded Salmond following an independence referendum in which Scotland voted to remain part of the UK.\n\nSwinney occupied several ministerial roles under Sturgeon, including education minister, and gained a reputation for being a steady and trusted hand.\n\nHe faced challenges, though, and twice survived no confidence votes, including over his refusal to publish legal advice during an inquiry into the flawed handling of harassment complaints against Salmond.\n\nAfter Yousaf succeeded Sturgeon in March last year, Swinney stepped down from government, saying it was time for a \"new generation\" to lead.\n\nSince then, internal divisions have been laid bare between progressives pushing trans rights and tough action against climate change, and more conservative members interested in core issues such as the economy.\n\nAll while the SNP faces pressure from a resurgent, union-supporting Labour party that is tipped to form the next UK government following an election due later this year.\n\nSwinney couldn't resist the call by senior SNP figures to return to try to revive his party's fortunes.\n\n\"I want to unite the SNP and unite Scotland for independence,\" he said, launching his leadership bid last week.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [],

new leader of the SNP does not mean John Swinney will automatically become Scotland's next first minister.\n\nFor that to happen the former deputy first minister has to face a vote in the Scottish Parliament, where he will need to win the support of MSPs.\n\nIt is likely other party leaders could put themselves forward for the ballot, though it is in reality unlikely that they would be successful in this.\n\nHowever for Swinney to win the vote in Holyrood, which could take place as early as Wednesday, he will need some MSPs from opposition parties to either back him in the vote, or at least abstain.\n\nThat is because without the powersharing deal with the Scottish Greens, which was ripped up by Humza Yousaf, the SNP is short of an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament.\n\nREAD MORE: John Swinney: I know what it takes to lead minority government and boost independence\n\nThe support of Scottish Greens therefore could still be crucial going forward, in this vote and in others to come at Holyrood.\n\nAssuming he wins the vote, Swinney will then become the Scottish Parliament's nominated candidate to be the country's seventh first minister.\n\nAfter that he would be formally appointed via a royal warrant, a legal document that is authorised by the King.\n\nFollowing that he would officially be sworn into the post in a ceremony at the Court of Session in Edinburgh by the Lord President, Scotland's most senior judge.\n\nThat could happen on Thursday morning with Swinney then potentially going on to take First Minister's Questions for the first time in the new role at noon the same day.\n\nHe will also have to appoint his his ministerial team of cabinet secretaries and junior ministers, with much attention on what position will go to Kate Forbes.\n\nThe former Holyrood finance secretary had been tipped as a possible challenger to Swinney for the SNP leadership, but announced on Thursday she would not stand and would instead back the former deputy first minister in his bid for the top job.\n\nSwinney, in announcing his candidacy sought to praise Forbes, who last year ran Yousaf a close second in the contest to succeed Nicola Sturgeon, and giving her a top post in his cabinet team would be seen as a move towards restoring unity within the different factions of the SNP.\n\nForbes has been out of the Scottish cabinet since

leadership, said he would \"not proceed\" with his nomination for party leader, and would instead support Mr Swinney, meaning he is set to become the next First Minister for Scotland.\n\nMr McCormick

had yet to be officially confirmed.\n\nMr Swinney, who described himself as the candidate to unite the party after a \"difficult\" few years, said an election contest would delay the SNP's essential

We should be seeking solutions to problems.\n\n\"I will reach out to everyone willing to join with us in good faith and seek compromises that serve our nation well. We need to stop shouting at each other and talk. More than that, actually, we need to listen. As first minister, I will do exactly that.\"\n\nJohn Swinney paid tribute to his predecessor Humza Yousaf (Andrew Milligan/PA)\n\n- Tributes to predecessor Humza Yousaf\n\nMr Swinney praised the \"grace and dignity\" of his predecessor, and said \"moral leadership on the issue of Gaza has been a light in very dark times\".\n\nHe thanked Mr Yousaf for his contribution to the SNP and for his work as First Minister, and said he expected him to play a part in Scottish politics.\n\nMr Swinney said: \"We must continue to illuminate hope, fight for international justice and be willing to stand up for what we believe to be right. That is what Humza Yousaf did.\n\n\"I know that Humza will continue to make a substantial contribution to the public life of Scotland and I thank him for all that he has done as our party leader and First Minister.\"\n\n- Relations with SNP figures including Kate Forbes\n\nMr Swinney addressed relations with other factions within the SNP and said he had met ex-finance secretary Kate Forbes to discuss her views.\n\nHe thanked Ms Forbes for backing his leadership, and said during a meeting that the former opponents \"came together and discussed the shared ambitions we have for our country and how best to go forward\".\n\nMr Swinney added: \"The simple lesson is that dialogue can bring us to points of agreement and strength.\"\n\nMr Swinney said her and Kate Forbes had discussed their 'shared ambitions\u00b4 (Jane Barlow/PA)\n\n- The Bute House Agreement will not be reinstated\n\nResponding to questions following his speech, Mr Swinney said he will not resurrect the defunct powersharing deal between the SNP and the Scottish Greens, known as the Bute House Agreement.\n\nHe said he would not implement that type of agreement, preferring to take issues on a case-by-case basis.\n\nMr Swinney said: \"I don't intend to return to the Bute House Agreement.\"\n\nMr Swinney and Nicola Sturgeon pose with a Yes sign ahead of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum (Lynne Cameron/PA)\n\n- Scottish independence\n\nMr Swinney said the party would \"get our act together\" and win back disaffected voters.\n\nHe said the \"country could do more if we had the powers of a normal independent nation\", and cited Brexit and the cost-of-living crisis as examples of Westminster decisions \"that are bad for Scotland\".\n\nMr Swinney said: \"They demonstrate why Scotland needs to have independence to make our own decisions and create our best future.\"\n\nTo rapturous applause, he said: \"If someone is an independence supporter in Scotland and they they want Scotland to be independent there's only one political party that will ever deliver and that's the Scottish National Party.\"\n\n- The Cass Review into gender identity services for young people will be 'listened to' amid pledges of a 'rational' approach\n\nMr Swinney described the Cass Review as \"evidence based\", and pledged to listen to clinicians.\n\nHe added: \"The Government will take a rational evidence based approach to the consideration of the Cass Review.\n\n\"On matters of such sensitivity about the wellbeing of children and young people we should listen to clinicians.\"",

If one does take place, Swinney will not be appointed as first minister until late May.\n\nOne of McCormick's backers, Iain Lawson, posted on X on Sunday that he had already obtained the 100 signatures required and was planning to hand them in to the SNP \"in person\".\n\nLawson also attacked Swinney for criticising the move, and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and \"raging\" that an ordinary member was challenging him.\n\n\"So Graeme McCormick has succeeded in getting the nominations he needed. Disappointed that JS [Swinney] has already had a dig at him before nominations even close for daring to challenge him. He is to give ordinary members the chance to question the new leader. New idea?\"\n\nMcCormick, some of whose allies want the Scottish government to mount a second independence referendum without Westminster's approval, won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP's caution as \"flatulence in a trance\" during last year's party conference.\n\nNominations to succeed Humza Yousaf as SNP leader close at noon on Monday. If another candidate crosses the nominations threshold and forces a contest, Yousaf is expected to remain in post and as Scotland's first minister until a winner is declared.\n\nMcCormick was very confident he would gather the signatures before the deadline after canvassing for support at an independence rally in Glasgow organised by All Under One Banner, the Sunday Herald newspaper reported.\n\nSwinney, who has been expecting to be confirmed as the new SNP leader on Monday afternoon and be voted in as first minister this week, warned on Sunday that a contest would delay his efforts to rebuild the party and put its deep divisions on public display.\n\n\"I think it would be better if we just got on with things, that we started the rebuilding of the SNP and its political strength,\" he told BBC Scotland's Sunday Show. \"We had a lot of strains around a couple of issues in parliament and I think we've just had a rough couple of years.\n\n\"[The] SNP has not looked cohesive; the SNP has not looked together. The central point of my message is we've got to get ourselves together.\"\n\nAn unopposed coronation would not be the SNP's first: Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond in November 2014 without a contest.\n\nSwinney's call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland, which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.\n\nThe poll, the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week, put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats, a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15. Labour, which has only two Scottish seats, would win 28.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "severin_carrell@theguardian.com", "name": "Severin Carrell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_second_Scottish_independence_referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proposed second Scottish independence referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Under_One_Banner", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All Under One Banner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Conservatives", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Conservatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunday Herald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sunday Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Salmond", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Salmond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95492b240797d2251017d2a54d4dc4443dcc502b/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=1b9d5290f4c551e50823f4866eaad37c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-11-", "textStart": 2876, "textEnd": 2889}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The 60-year-old is expected to be appointed as the next first minister of Scotland on Tuesday. He insisted that after quitting government last year following Nicola Sturgeon exiting Bute House, he is \"now physically and mentally rested and ready for what lies ahead\".\n\nThe Perthshire North MSP warned that despite the SNP being the largest party at Holyrood, that mandate \"does not give us a monopoly on good ideas\", as he warned that \"the polarisation of politics does not serve our country well\".\n\nSpeaking at Glasgow University after accepting the party leadership, Mr Swinney said despite him gearing up to lead a minority Scottish Government, that \"does not mean we can stop listening to people and voices outside our party\".\n\nIn a pitch to opponents across the political divide, Mr Swinney added: \"I will reach out to everyone willing to join with us in good faith and seek compromises that serve our nation well.\n\n\"That does not mean debate will end - far from it - but it does mean that, should I be elected, I will first seek to find common ground, to join together in coalitions of the willing and solve the problems our country faces. We need to stop shouting at each other and talk.\"\n\nThe new SNP leader suggested that his government is set to look to unionist parties such as Labour, the LibDems and the Conservatives to help pass legislation and budgets, after previously relying on the Greens in both the formal co-operation agreement that led to his predecessor's downfall and loose support under Ms Sturgeon.\n\nMr Swinney told The Scotsman that he will \"progress a moderate centre-left agenda\" - suggesting a move away from policies prioritised under previous collaboration with by the Greens if there is opposition to those ideas being pushed forward.\n\nHe added: \"There's a lot of policy proposals in front of the parliament just now which are essential to advancing that agenda and we'll work collaboratively to get some of those through.\n\n\"If some of them are coming up against resistance or opposition then we'll be able to have discussions about that.\"\n\nMr Swinney said: \"I'm setting out a willingness to work with other people today. I hope that's reciprocated.\n\n\"The parliament doesn't have to be polarised. There's bound to be things that can be done if there's good will. I accept that if there's no good will, then it gets a bit more tricky. I don't see why there's a reason why there shouldn't be good will.\"\n\nPatrick Harvie, the co-leader of the Scottish Greens, has warned Mr Swinney that \"if he is to have our support then it must be on the basis of progressive policies that help us to tackle the climate crisis and build a fairer and more equal future\".\n\nHe added: \"The next Scottish Government will face an important choice. Will they offer a progressive vision for Scotland's future, or will they retreat toward the tepid middle ground, which would force them to rely on the Tories and other pro-union parties?\n\n\"There are a lot of important policies already on their way to delivery as a result of the Bute House Agreement, including better rights for tenants and rent controls, transforming the way we heat our homes and a watertight ban on conversion therapy. We remain utterly committed to these policies and will oppose any move away from them or steps to dilute them.\"\n\nAsked about these priorities by the Greens, Mr Swinney declined to state his support for any of the policies.\n\nHe said: \"I'm sure there will be a lot of common ground between ourselves and the Scottish Green party - we've worked really collaboratively in the course of the last couple of years in the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government.\n\n\"I want to work with all members of parliament to chart the future of Scotland and we can do that in a collaborative and cooperative way.\"\n\nMr Swinney ruled out a \"return to the Bute House Agreement\" and the \"type of fixed arrangements\" previously between the SNP and Greens, stressing he will \"take it on an issue by issue basis\".\n\nHe added: \"On some issues I'm sure there will be alignment with the Scottish Green party, but I'm sure on other issues, we'll have to find support and agreement from other political parties.\n\n\"We're in a situation where we will be operating in a minority government and it's important that we can find common cause where we can find that on the issues that matter.\"\n\nMr Harvie caused disdain amongst some SNP backbench MSPs for disputing the Cass review into gender identity services in England, which Mr Yousaf has now suggested contributed to him tearing up the Bute House Agreement.\n\nMr Swinney has insisted that \"the Cass review has got to be taken extremely seriously\".\n\nHe added: \"Crucially for me, clinical opinion is essential for these questions. The government will take a rational evidence-based approach to the consideration of the Cass review, draw on the opinions and the evidence put to us by clinicians. On matters of such sensitivity about the wellbeing of children and young people, we should listen to clinicians.\"\n\nBut unionist leaders have already suggested an unwillingness to cooperate as Mr Swinney is poised to become the next first minister.\n\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said it was \"difficult to see how he can be the fresh start Scotland needs, when he's the ultimate continuity candidate\" and warned Mr Swinney will \"ignore the real priorities of the Scottish people, such as fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy\",\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar claimed Mr Swinney has \"been at the heart of this incompetent government for 17 years\", branding his coronation as \"a stitch-up by a chaotic and dysfunctional party that is more interested in protecting its own interests than serving the interests of the people of Scotland\".", "source": {"uri": "scotsman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scotsman"}, "authors": [{"uri":

"body": "John Swinney, who was for over eight years deputy first minister at Holyrood, now seems certain to take on the top job in Scottish politics.\n\nBut as first minister he is sure to face a bulging in-tray, packed with issues to address, when he enters Bute House.\n\nPerhaps the first task facing him in his new role will be to appoint the cabinet team who will support him as part of the Scottish Government.\n\nA veteran of the Scottish Government since the SNP, Mr Swinney has already held many of the key posts, including having served as finance secretary, and education secretary, so will know what is expected of those he appoints to serve under him.\n\nA new Scottish cabinet could be announced as early as Thursday, with all eyes on what post could be given to Kate Forbes, who like Mr Swinney has previously been in charge of the finance brief for the Scottish Government.\n\nShe had ran to be SNP leader and first minister when Nicola Sturgeon stepped down, coming a close second to Humza Yousaf.\n\nThis time round however she declined to stand, instead backing Mr Swinney and appointing her to a key post in the Scottish Government could also help the new SNP leader with another task he faced, that of uniting his party.\n\nMs Forbes is amongst a group of SNP MSPs who have spoken out against several of the policies pursued and promoted by the Scottish Greens while in government, such as gender recognition reforms, which were blocked by Westminster, and highly protected marine areas, a policy which was ditched by the Scottish Government after attracting criticism from the fishing sector and others.\n\nWhile Ms Forbes refused to serve in Mr Yousaf's cabinet team, bringing her back into the heart of government could help appease those within the SNP who had been concerned about the role the Greens played in power.\n\nWith the powersharing agreement with the Greens no longer in place, Mr Swinney will be forced to lead a minority government at Holyrood.\n\nAs part of this role he will have to work with other parties in the Scottish Parliament on an issue by issue basis if he wants legislation to be passed by Holyrood.\n\nHe acknowledged this when he announced he was running for the SNP leadership, saying his party must now \"work to seek common ground in the Scottish Parliament in the interests of the public and of good governance\".\n\nMr Swinney added that as a result, the party's approach in Holyrood would \"have to change, to listen, to compromise, to work with all other political parties\".\n\nAs new SNP leader he will have lead his party in what could likely prove to be a difficult general election campaign later this year.\n\nPolls suggest the SNP could lose seats at Westminster, with the party facing a challenge from a revived Scottish Labour Party in the battle for votes.\n\nMeanwhile his appointment comes as the Police Scotland probe into the SNP's finances continues, with the new party leader also having to deal with any further political fallout from that.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

proceed\" with his nomination for party leader, and would instead support Mr Swinney, meaning he is set to become the next First Minister for Scotland.\n\nMr McCormick told the PA news agency that he \"met the thresholds for party rules\", but \"after a lengthy and fruitful conversation\" with Mr Swinney he decided to instead give his full support to him.\n\nMr McCormick wrote: \"John and I agreed

\"difficult\" few years, said an election contest would delay the SNP's essential rebuild.\n\nBut he signalled he would win any potential contest, telling Sky News that party members \"probably know the outcome\" between the two potential candidates.\n\nMr Swinney will be named as the next SNP leader and a subsequent Holyrood vote later in the week could see him replace Mr Yousaf as Scotland's first minister.\n\nThe SNP said it does not comment on such matters.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He is very well liked in the SNP because of this.\"\n\nBorn in Edinburgh in April 1964, Swinney joined the SNP when he was 15, quickly rising through its ranks and becoming national secretary in the mid-1980s.\n\nHe first became a lawmaker in 1997 when he was elected to the UK parliament in London to represent a constituency in Tayside, in the heart of Scotland.\n\nTwo years later, he was elected to Scotland's regional parliament at Holyrood in Edinburgh when it was re-established after more than 300 years, with Labour at the helm.\n\nSwinney first became SNP leader in September 2000 following the departure of Alex Salmond.\n\nBut he endured a torrid four years in charge as the SNP's fortunes slumped during the early days of Scotland's devolved parliament and the height of New Labour mania under UK prime minister Tony Blair.\n\nDespite an expenses scandal forcing then-Labour first minister Henry McLeish from office in 2001, the opposition SNP still lost several seats at Holyrood in the 2003 Scottish parliamentary election.\n\nMore from this section Mike Macdonald after his 1st day as an NFL head coach, day 1 Seahawks rookie minicamp Hundreds of athletes compete in Special Olympics New York Spring Games at Plainedge High School MLB Padres deal for two-time batting champ Arraez\n\nSwinney saw off a leadership contest from an SNP activist but was forced to step down after a dismal showing at the 2004 European Parliament elections.\n\n- 'Unite' -\n\nHis political career enjoyed a rebirth in 2007 when the SNP, then under the leadership of Salmond again, became the largest party at Holyrood and Swinney became finance minister.\n\nHe became deputy first minister in 2014 after Sturgeon succeeded Salmond following an independence referendum in which Scotland voted to remain part of the UK.\n\nSwinney occupied several ministerial roles under Sturgeon, including education minister, and gained a reputation for being a steady and trusted hand.\n\nHe faced challenges, though, and twice survived no confidence votes, including over his refusal to publish legal advice during an inquiry into the flawed handling of harassment complaints against Salmond.\n\nAfter Yousaf succeeded Sturgeon in March last year, Swinney stepped down from government, saying it was time for a \"new generation\" to lead.\n\nSince then, internal divisions have been laid bare between progressives pushing trans rights and tough action against climate change, and more conservative members interested in core issues such as the economy.\n\nAll while the SNP faces pressure from a resurgent, union-supporting Labour party that is tipped to form the next UK government following an election due later this year.\n\nSwinney couldn't resist the call by senior SNP figures to return to try to revive his party's fortunes.\n\n\"I want to unite the SNP and unite Scotland for independence,\" he said, launching his leadership bid last week.\n\npdh/phz/har/jm", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com",

It's easy and will only take a moment.\n\nJohn Swinney has been crowned the new leader of the SNP after winning the support of potential contender, Highland MSP Kate Forbes.\n\nIt means that party elders can breathe a sigh of relief and do without a costly leadership election which could have risked dividing the party.\n\nMr Swinney is expected to give an acceptance speech later today.\n\nThe next step in the process is for a vote at Holyrood, likely tomorrow, to confirm Mr Swinney as the First Minister - before which Humza Yousaf must formally resign from the tole, having already announced his intention to do so.\n\nHighland MSP and Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross previously confirmed he plans to enter his name in the race to lead the country though this is likely to be a largely symbolic gesture.\n\nOpposition parties have been demanding a Scottish election given the recent changes in the resident of Bute House but Mr Swinney ruled that out when he announced his intention to stand as party leader.\n\nIn the event that the parliament fails to agree the nomination of a First Minister within 28 days, the presiding officer must propose a date for an \"extraordinary general election\" but that has never happened in Scotland.\n\nJohn Swinney offers Kate Forbes a top government job in bid to become First Minister\n\nGiving her thoughts on Mr Swinney ahead of today's expected announcement Rhoda Grant, Highlands and Islands Labour MSP said: \"John Swinney is a failed SNP leader of the past and has been a part of the senior leadership of the SNP that has presided over the failures of this government for the past 17 years.\n\n\"This is not a fresh start, it is simply the 'same old' and we need an election now to allow the people to decide who runs the country\".\n\nThe SNP's Maree Todd, Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP, however, said: \"Nobody is more experienced than John Swinney.\n\n\"Having worked closely with him as his junior minister when he was cabinet secretary for education, I know him to be dedicated, principled and a skilled negotiator.\n\n\"I am confident that he will deliver on his promises to create a modern, diverse, and dynamic Scotland, and of course, unite Scotland for independence.\"\n\nJamie Halcro Johnston, Conservative MSP, said: \"The very least the people of the Highlands and Islands should be able to expect is a government focused on their issues and not just the SNP's own obsession with another independence referendum.\n\n\"Rural and island communities want to see promised road improvements like the dualling of the A9 completed. They want our beleaguered ferries network operating without cancellations and delays, and Scottish ministers to stop talking about new vessels and actually deliver them.\n\n\"And they want new hospitals built, cuts to services reversed and schools fit to learn and teach in, not just endless excuses from the SNP government on why they're not.\n\n\"John Swinney has already confirmed that his priority will be independence and that the SNP will remain a central-belt focused party that offers nothing to communities across the Highlands and Islands that deserve so much more.\n\n\"This isn't a bright new start for the SNP, it's just more of the same\".\n\nWhile Greens MSP Ariane Burgess said: \"The Scottish Greens have been very clear that the leadership of the SNP is a matter for their members to decide.\n\n\"The current First Minister has decided that the SNP wishes to operate as a minority government, which means whoever they choose to lead them in Holyrood must command the support of the majority of Scotland's MSPs.\n\n\"It's important that politicians of all parties model the kind of thoughtful, collaborative and cooperative work that the Scottish Parliament is founded upon and myself and my Scottish Green colleagues will seek common cause with all those who share our vision for a greener, fairer Scotland\".\n\nThe SNP's Emma Roddick told us: \"I was delighted with John's speech last week, I know how excellent he is as a leader and as a person to work with, so, I'm just hopeful for his leadership and what it will bring.\n\n\"When he and Nicola resigned last year, I told him I was looking forward to learning from him on the backbenches. I was then put into government, so, it didn't look as I had imagined, but I learn so much from him all the time and I know and trust he will do the right thing for Scotland and the SNP\".", "source":

sees Labour take lead over SNP", "body": "According to a poll for The Sunday Times by Norstat (formerly known as Panelbase), the SNP will retain 15 of its current 43 seats at the forthcoming General Election.\n\nThe poll looked at voting intentions for both Westminster and Holyrood and is one of the first to come out since Humza Yousaf announced his resignation.\n\nIt found that while support for independence remains largely unchanged, Labour is set to overtake the SNP at both Westminster and Holyrood, bringing an end to the SNP's streak of four consecutive election victories.\n\nThe survey comes as John Swinney is now expected to become first minister on Tuesday, provided no other challengers enter the race.\n\nREAD MORE: Patrick Harvie speaks out after end of Bute House Agreement\n\nWhen asked who would make the best first minister from a list of SNP candidates, Swinney and Kate Forbes were neck and neck with the public on 23%, although Forbes has said she will not be standing.\n\nStephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, was backed by 7%, and Jenny Gilruth, the Scottish education secretary, scored 2%.\n\nThe SNP vote share in a Westminster election would fall to its lowest level since the 2014 independence referendum, the poll says.\n\nThe party would hold just 15 of its 43 seats with Scottish Labour winning 28 - a dramatic increase from its current two.\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times poll, the SNP would attract votes from 29% of the electorate - a fall of three points in a month, while Labour's share increased by two points to 34%.\n\nThis would return 15 SNP MPs and amount to a significant reversal in electoral performance.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives, whose vote share remained at 16% in the poll, would add three seats to return nine MPs - while the Liberal Democrats, on 8%, would boost their yield by one to five MPs.\n\nSupport for independence remains strong, with 48% in favour of Scotland leaving the UK and 52% backing the Union.\n\nVoting intentions at Holyrood show the SNP remains a point ahead of Labour in the constituency vote at 34%.\n\nREAD MORE: The Yes movement reacts as John Swinney set to become first minister\n\nThe Conservatives would pick up 14% of the vote, the Lib Dems 9% and the Greens 5% - with the remaining 5% to other parties.\n\nBut Scottish Labour has edged a point ahead of the SNP on the more proportional regional list vote with the nationalists' return of 27%.\n\nThe Tories would win 17% of regional votes, the Greens 9%, Lib Dems 8%, Reform UK 6% and Alex Salmond's Alba Party 4%.\n\nAn analysis by polling expert Sir John Curtice for the Sunday Times found that this result would leave Labour as the largest party at Holyrood with 40 seats.\n\nThe remainder of the chamber would be 38 for the SNP, 24 Conservatives, 10 Greens, nine Lib Dems and eight Reform parliamentarians.\n\nThis would mark a historic breakthrough for Nigel Farage's party in Scotland as it at least partially replicates its gains in England by attracting some older, Brexit-supporting Tories north of the border.\n\nCurtice (above), professor of politics at Strathclyde University and the person who compiled the seat projections, said the \"question that now arises is whether the coronation of John Swinney will enable the SNP to turn the page\".\n\nHe added: \"Even among those who said they would vote Yes in another independence referendum, only 56% said they were now willing to back the SNP for Westminster, as would only two-thirds who voted for the party in 2019.\"\n\nNorstat interviewed 1,086 people aged 16 or over in Scotland between April 30 and May 3.\n\nSNP depute leader Keith Brown commented: \"After 14 years of cruel Tory governments inflicting endless damage on Scotland and Keir Starmer's Labour offering no meaningful alternative, it's clear only the SNP and independence offers a better future for our country.\n\n\"The SNP is the only party standing up for the priorities of people across Scotland and offering a positive vision for the future where decisions about Scotland are made in Scotland.\n\n\"At the general election Scottish voters have the chance to reject the cosy status quo of a broken Westminster system that is failing them and vote to elect SNP MPs who will always stand up for their interests\".", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType":

coming from the UK Government to the Scottish budget, our public services are far from perfect, but statistics show that under the SNP Scotland's services are in a better state than in Tory-run

The clear path for Swinney to ascend to leadership came as former finance minister Kate Forbes stepped aside. Forbes ran for leadership last year against Humza Yousaf but fell short as her positions on gay marriage and abortion -- informed by her Catholic faith -- put her out of step with the leftist base of the party.\n\nThe fact that Swinney was unopposed points to the party brass not wanting to go through another bruising leadership contest but also that the Sword of Damocles hangs above any future leader after dispatching with Swinney's former boss in Nicola Sturgeon last year and Humza Yousaf last week.\n\nWhile support for the SNP has faltered over economic mismanagement and persistent issues surrounding the socialised National Health Service, transgender issues were at the heart of the downfall of both Sturgeon and Yousaf, with Sturgeon's inability to say whether a convicted transgender rapist was a woman or not contributing to the end of her reign and disagreement over the prescribing of puberty blockers to children with his Green Party coalition partner sparking the collapse of Yousaf's short-lived tenure in office.\n\nEven before taking office, Swinney has faced a barrage of criticism over his woke stance on transgender issues, having similarly failed to be able to say whether biological males who claim to be women are actually women or not.\n\nHarry Potter author and prominent Scottish resident J.K. Rowling took aim at Swinney, saying: \"I don't know about you, but male politicians obfuscating and blustering to avoid uttering the dangerous words 'women don't have penises' totally convinces me that the rights and protections of 51 per cent of the population are safe in their hands.\"\n\nRowling has become a leading critic of the SNP government's woke agenda, notably daring Police Scotland to arrest her for appearing to violate Yousaf's controversial hate speech legislation, which criminalises the \"stirring up hatred\" against protected classes of people with up to seven years in prison.\n\nFormer SNP deputy leader and the co-director of the feminist For Women Scotland group, Marion Calder, also criticised Swinney for his murky stance on gender, saying: \"We would have hoped Mr Swinney had learned his lesson from previous first ministers.\n\n\"He states he 'believes in the rule of law' but does he believe people can change sex? That a woman can become a man? If he plans to be in power over the next two years, many will ask him these questions over and over again.\"\n\nSwinney has also refused to rule out the possibility of reviving controversial self-identification legislation, which would pave the way for biological males to have the right to female-only spaces. The self-ID law was struck down last year by the UK government in Westminster, however, it continues to be favoured by the far-left Green Party, whose support Swinney will need to keep his government together.\n\nIndeed, Patrick Harvie, the co-leader of the Scottish Greens said that Swinney hopes to maintain their support, it \"must be on the basis of progressive policies\".\n\nAlba Party General Secretary Chris McEleny commented: \"It's clear John Swinney is already pandering to the Greens in fear of losing their support,\" adding that Swinney should \"focus on jobs, health, education, the cost of living crisis and self-determination -- not self-ID.\"\n\nIn addition to controversies surrounding LGBT ideology, the SNP under Swinney will also have to weather the storm of the budding corruption probe into the party, with Peter Murrell, the former chief executive of the Scottish National Party and husband of former leader Nicola Sturgeon -- under whom Swinney served as deputy first minister -- being charged by police last month in connection to alleged embezzlement of party funds.\n\nScottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said: \"It's difficult to see how he can be the fresh start Scotland needs, when he's the ultimate continuity candidate.

with John Swinney set to succeed Humza Yousaf.\n\nMr Swinney is on track to become Scotland's seventh first minister as early as Tuesday.\n\nThe former deputy first minister, who served under close ally Nicola Sturgeon, emerged as a frontrunner following Mr Yousaf's resignation last week.\n\nFormer finance secretary Kate Forbes had been tipped to join him, but later announced she would not stand and instead threw her support behind Mr Swinney.\n\nMr Swinney has said he would want Ms Forbes to \"play a significant part\" in his government.\n\nPotential challenger Graeme McCormick also withdrew his bid at the 11th hour.\n\nThe veteran SNP activist claimed he had secured the 100 nominations from 20 branches needed to enter the contest but backed out of the campaign on Sunday evening after a \"lengthy and fruitful conversation\" with Mr Swinney.\n\nThe SNP has appeared keen to avoid an explosive leadership contest similar to the one that followed Ms Sturgeon's resignation.\n\nLast year's race, involving Mr Yousaf, Ms Forbes and now Alba Party MSP Ash Regan, featured rows over religious beliefs, arguments about the recollection of past events, and widespread criticism of secrecy surrounding the vote.\n\nAssuming there are no last-minute challengers, Mr Swinney will be clear to take over as SNP leader.\n\nMr Swinney will then need to seek parliamentary approval to succeed Mr Yousaf as first minister.\n\nThe timing is decided by the parliamentary bureau, and could take place as early as Tuesday.\n\nThe parliament will have 28 days to nominate a replacement for Mr Yousaf once his resignation has been accepted by the King.\n\nAs the SNP is comfortably the largest party in Holyrood, the onus is on them to find a new leader who can work with other parties in a minority government.\n\nThe SNP's tally of 63 MSPs leaves them just short of a majority in the 129-member parliament, meaning politicians from other parties would need to be persuaded to either vote for an SNP candidate, or at least abstain in the ballot, for the party to be successful.\n\nThe leaders from other political parties can also put themselves forward and MSPs can nominate a candidate, although it must be seconded by another member.\n\nIf that happens, any candidate that secures more than half of all votes will win the nomination.\n\nIf no one reaches that threshold, the candidate with the fewest votes will be eliminated - with the process repeated until the candidates are whittled down to two.\n\nAt that point, a candidate will only require a simple majority to win.\n\nWhoever wins the vote is then formally appointed by the King.\n\nAn official swearing-in ceremony at the Court of Session in Edinburgh would then take place.\n\nHowever, if no new first minister can be selected within the 28 days, the Scottish parliament would be forced to hold an extraordinary general election.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deputy First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Regan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ash Regan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alba_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alba Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Session", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Court of Session"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/24/05/1600x900/skynews-john-swinney-snp-scottish-parliament_6545079.jpg?20240506090435", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

He is very well liked in the SNP because of this.\"\n\nBorn in Edinburgh in April 1964, Swinney joined the SNP when he was 15, quickly rising through its ranks and becoming national secretary in the mid-1980s.\n\nHe first became a lawmaker in 1997 when he was elected to the UK parliament in London to represent a constituency in Tayside, in the heart of Scotland.\n\nTwo years later, he was elected to Scotland's regional parliament at Holyrood in Edinburgh when it was re-established after more than 300 years, with Labour at the helm. Swinney first became SNP leader in September 2000 following the departure of Alex Salmond.\n\nBut he endured a torrid four years in charge as the SNP's fortunes slumped during the early days of Scotland's devolved parliament and the height of New Labour mania under UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nDespite an expenses scandal forcing then-Labour first minister Henry McLeish from office in 2001, the opposition SNP still lost several seats at Holyrood in the 2003 Scottish parliamentary election.\n\nSwinney saw off a leadership contest from an SNP activist but was forced to step down after a dismal showing at the 2004 European Parliament elections.\n\n'Unite'\n\nHis political career enjoyed a rebirth in 2007 when the SNP, then under the leadership of Salmond again, became the largest party at Holyrood and Swinney became finance minister.\n\nHe became deputy first minister in 2014 after Sturgeon succeeded Salmond following an independence referendum in which Scotland voted to remain part of the UK.\n\nSwinney occupied several ministerial roles under Sturgeon, including education minister, and gained a reputation for being a steady and trusted hand.\n\nHe faced challenges, though, and twice survived no confidence votes, including over his refusal to publish legal advice during an inquiry into the flawed handling of harassment complaints against Salmond.\n\nAfter Yousaf succeeded Sturgeon in March last year, Swinney stepped down from government, saying it was time for a \"new generation\" to lead.\n\nSince then, internal divisions have been laid bare between progressives pushing trans rights and tough action against climate change, and more conservative members interested in core issues such as the economy.\n\nAll while the SNP faces pressure from a resurgent, union-supporting Labour party that is tipped to form the next UK government following an election due later this year.\n\nSwinney couldn't resist the call by senior SNP figures to return to try to revive his party's fortunes.\n\n\"I want to unite the SNP and unite Scotland for independence,\" he said, launching his leadership bid on Thursday.\n\nAfter proposed challenger Kate Forbes announced she would not be running, Swinney's coronation as SNP leader, and Scotland's next first minister, looks assured.\n\nRead more:\n\nScottish government survives no

30 seats", "body": "The beleaguered Scottish National Party is on course for a battering at the hands of voters at the next election, potentially losing two-thirds of its Westminster seats.\n\nA new poll today suggests the party could return just 15 MPs from its current crop of 43 amid the fallout from Humza Yousaf's shock resignation.\n\nThe Sunday Times poll, by Norstat - formerly known as Panelbase, is one of the first of its kind since Mr Yousaf announced his resignation, and looked at voting intentions for both Westminster and Holyrood.\n\nIt found that while support for independence remains largely unchanged, Labour is set to overtake the SNP at both Westminster and Holyrood, bringing an end to the SNP's streak of four consecutive election victories.\n\nThe party is in turmoil since Mr Yousaf stood down last week, having lost the support of the Greens at Holyrood in a row over trans rights and environmental policies.\n\nHis would-be successor John Swinney is also facing a further aggravation today, with plans for him to quickly installed as party leader and First Minister facing being thwarted.\n\nSNP campaigner Graeme McCormick, who is not an MSP, is said to be considering running, which would lead to a three-week leadership campaign instead of Mr Swinney being installed on Tuesday.\n\nA new poll today suggests the party could return just 15 MPs from its current crop of 43 amid the fallout from Humza Yousaf's shock resignation.\n\nHis would-be successor John Swinney is also facing a further aggravation today, with plans for him to quickly installed as party leader and First Minister facing being thwarted.\n\nWhen asked who would make the best first minister from a list of SNP candidates, Mr Swinney and Kate Forbes were neck and neck with the public on 23 per cent, although Ms Forbes has said she will not be standing.\n\nStephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, was backed by 7 per cent, and Jenny Gilruth, the Scottish education secretary, scored just 2 per cent.\n\nThe SNP vote share in a Westminster election would fall to its lowest level since the 2014 independence referendum, the poll says.\n\nThe party would hold just 15 of its 43 seats with Scottish Labour winning 28 - a dramatic increase from its current two.\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times poll, the SNP would attract votes from 29 per cent of the electorate - a fall of three points in a month, while Labour's share increased by two points to 34 per cent.\n\nThis would return 15 SNP MPs and amount to a significant reversal in electoral performance.\n\nUnder Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP became the third largest party at Westminster, winning 56 of 59 Scottish seats in 2015.\n\nThere are currently 43 SNP MPs at Westminster.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives, whose vote share remained at 16% in the poll, would add three seats to return nine MPs - while the Liberal Democrats, on 8%, would boost their yield by one to five MPs.\n\nSupport for independence remains evenly balanced, with 48% in favour of Scotland leaving the UK and 52 per cent backing the Union.\n\nVoting intentions at Holyrood show the SNP remains a point ahead of Labour in the constituency vote at 34 per cent.\n\nThe Conservatives would pick up 14 per cent of the vote, the Lib Dems 9 per cent and the Greens 5 per cent - with the remaining 5 per cent to other parties.\n\nBut Scottish Labour has edged a point ahead of the SNP on the more proportional regional list vote with the nationalists' return of 27 per cent.\n\nThe Tories would win 17 per cent of regional votes, the Greens 9 per cent, Lib Dems 8 per cent, Reform UK 6 per cent and Alex Salmond's Alba Party 4 per cent.\n\nAn analysis by polling expert Sir John Curtice for the Sunday Times found that this result would leave Labour as the largest party at Holyrood with 40 seats.\n\nThe remainder of the chamber would be 38 for the SNP, 24 Conservatives, 10 Greens, nine Lib Dems and eight Reform parliamentarians.\n\nThis would mark a historic breakthrough for Nigel Farage's party in Scotland as it at least partially replicates its gains in England by attracting some older, Brexit-supporting Tories north of the border.\n\nSir John, professor of politics at Strathclyde University - who compiled the seat projections, said the 'question that now arises is whether the coronation of John Swinney will enable the SNP to turn the page'.\n\nHe added: 'Even among those who said they would vote Yes in another independence referendum, only 56 per cent said they were now willing to back the SNP for Westminster, as would only two-thirds who voted for the party in 2019.'\n\nNorstat interviewed 1,086 people aged 16 or over in Scotland between April 30 and May 3.\n\nSNP depute leader Keith Brown commented: 'After 14 years of cruel Tory governments inflicting endless damage on Scotland and Keir Starmer's Labour offering no meaningful alternative, it's clear only the SNP and independence offers a better future for our country.\n\n'The SNP is the only party standing up for the priorities of people across Scotland and offering a positive vision for the future where decisions about Scotland are made in Scotland.\n\n'At the general election Scottish voters have the chance to reject the cosy status quo of a broken Westminster system that is failing them and vote to elect SNP MPs who will always stand up for their interests'.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We should be seeking solutions to problems.\n\n\"I will reach out to everyone willing to join with us in good faith and seek compromises that serve our nation well. We need to stop shouting at each other and talk. More than that, actually, we need to listen. As first minister, I will do exactly that.\"\n\n- Tributes to predecessor Humza Yousaf\n\nMr Swinney praised the \"grace and dignity\" of his predecessor, and said \"moral leadership on the issue of Gaza has been a light in very dark times\".\n\nHe thanked Mr Yousaf for his contribution to the SNP and for his work as First Minister, and said he expected him to play a part in Scottish politics.\n\nMr Swinney said: \"We must continue to illuminate hope, fight for international justice and be willing to stand up for what we believe to be right. That is what Humza Yousaf did.\n\n\"I know that Humza will continue to make a substantial contribution to the public life of Scotland and I thank him for all that he has done as our party leader and First Minister.\"\n\n- Relations with SNP figures including Kate Forbes\n\nMr Swinney addressed relations with other factions within the SNP and said he had met ex-finance secretary Kate Forbes to discuss her views.\n\nHe thanked Ms Forbes for backing his leadership, and said during a meeting that the former opponents \"came together and discussed the shared ambitions we have for our country and how best to go forward\".\n\nMr Swinney added: \"The simple lesson is that dialogue can bring us to points of agreement and strength.\"\n\n- The Bute House Agreement will not be reinstated\n\nResponding to questions following his speech, Mr Swinney said he will not resurrect the defunct powersharing deal between the SNP and the Scottish Greens, known as the Bute House Agreement.\n\nHe said he would not implement that type of agreement, preferring to take issues on a case-by-case basis.\n\nMr Swinney said: \"I don't intend to return to the Bute House Agreement.\"\n\n- Scottish independence\n\nMr Swinney said the party would \"get our act together\" and win back disaffected voters.\n\nHe said the \"country could do more if we had the powers of a normal independent nation\", and cited Brexit and the cost-of-living crisis as examples of Westminster decisions \"that are bad for Scotland\".\n\nMr Swinney said: \"They demonstrate why Scotland needs to have independence to make our own decisions and create our best future.\"\n\nTo rapturous applause, he said: \"If someone is an independence supporter in Scotland and they they want Scotland to be independent there's only one political party that will ever deliver and that's the Scottish National Party.\"\n\n- The Cass Review into gender identity services for young people will be 'listened to' amid pledges of a 'rational' approach\n\nMr Swinney described the Cass Review as \"evidence based\", and pledged to listen to clinicians.\n\nHe added: \"The Government will take a rational evidence based approach to the consideration of the Cass Review.\n\n\"On matters of such sensitivity about the wellbeing of children and young people we should listen to clinicians.\"",

seats with Labour set to overtake in...", "body": "The SNP will retain just 15 of its current 43 seats at the forthcoming general election, according to a new poll for the Sunday Times.\n\nThe forecast comes as Humza Yousaf announced his resignation as First Minister on Monday after he abruptly ended the Bute House Agreement with the Scottish Green Party.\n\nThe Sunday Times poll, by Norstat - formerly known as Panelbase, is one of the first of its kind since Mr Yousaf announced his resignation, and looked at voting intentions for both Westminster and Holyrood.\n\nIt found that while support for independence remains largely unchanged, Labour is set to overtake the SNP at both Westminster and Holyrood, bringing an end to the SNP's streak of four consecutive election victories.\n\nThe survey comes as John Swinney is now expected to become first minister on Tuesday, provided no other challengers enter the race.\n\nWhen asked who would make the best first minister from a list of SNP candidates, Mr Swinney and Kate Forbes were neck and neck with the public on 23%, although Ms Forbes has said she will not be standing.\n\nThe poll found Kate Forbes was equally as popular as John Swinney in regard to who should lead the country (Jane Barlow/PA)\n\nStephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, was backed by 7%, and Jenny Gilruth, the Scottish education secretary, scored just 2%.\n\nThe SNP vote share in a Westminster election would fall to its lowest level since the 2014 independence referendum, the poll says.\n\nThe party would hold just 15 of its 43 seats with Scottish Labour winning 28 - a dramatic increase from its current two.\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times poll, the SNP would attract votes from 29% of the electorate - a fall of three points in a month, while Labour's share increased by two points to 34%.\n\nThis would return 15 SNP MPs and amount to a significant reversal in electoral performance.\n\nUnder Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP became the third largest party at Westminster, winning 56 of 59 Scottish seats in 2015.\n\nFormer first minister Nicola Sturgeon (Jane Barlow/PA)\n\nThere are currently 43 SNP MPs at Westminster.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives, whose vote share remained at 16% in the poll, would add three seats to return nine MPs - while the Liberal Democrats, on 8%, would boost their yield by one to five MPs.\n\nSupport for independence remains evenly balanced, with 48% in favour of Scotland leaving the UK and 52% backing the Union.\n\nVoting intentions at Holyrood show the SNP remains a point ahead of Labour in the constituency vote at 34%.\n\nThe Conservatives would pick up 14% of the vote, the Lib Dems 9% and the Greens 5% - with the remaining 5% to other parties.\n\nBut Scottish Labour has edged a point ahead of the SNP on the more proportional regional list vote with the nationalists' return of 27%.\n\nThe Tories would win 17% of regional votes, the Greens 9%, Lib Dems 8%, Reform UK 6% and Alex Salmond's Alba Party 4%.\n\nAn analysis by polling expert Sir John Curtice for the Sunday Times found that this result would leave Labour as the largest party at Holyrood with 40 seats.\n\nThe remainder of the chamber would be 38 for the SNP, 24 Conservatives, 10 Greens, nine Lib Dems and eight Reform parliamentarians.\n\nThis would mark a historic breakthrough for Nigel Farage's party in Scotland as it at least partially replicates its gains in England by attracting some older, Brexit-supporting Tories north of the border.\n\nEven among those who said they would vote Yes in another independence referendum, only 56 per cent said they were now willing to back the SNP for Westminster, as would only two-thirds who voted for the party in 2019 Sir John Curtice, polling expert\n\nSir John, professor of politics at Strathclyde University - who compiled the seat projections, said the \"question that now arises is whether the coronation of John Swinney will enable the SNP to turn the page\".\n\nHe added: \"Even among those who said they would vote Yes in another independence referendum, only 56% said they were now willing to back the SNP for Westminster, as would only two-thirds who voted for the party in 2019.\"\n\nNorstat interviewed 1,086 people aged 16 or over in Scotland between April 30 and May 3.\n\nSNP depute leader Keith Brown commented: \"After 14 years of cruel Tory governments inflicting endless damage on Scotland and Keir Starmer's Labour offering no meaningful alternative, it's clear only the SNP and independence offers a better future for our country.\n\n\"The SNP is the only party standing up for the priorities of people across Scotland and offering a positive vision for the future where decisions about Scotland are made in Scotland.\n\n\"At the general election Scottish voters have the chance to reject the cosy status quo of a broken Westminster system that is failing them and vote to elect SNP MPs who will always stand up for their interests\".", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf",

Scottish politics.\n\nBut as first minister he is sure to face a bulging in-tray, packed with issues to address, when he enters Bute House.\n\nPerhaps the first task facing him in his new role will be to appoint the cabinet team who will support him as part of the Scottish Government.\n\nA veteran of the Scottish Government since the SNP, Mr Swinney has already held many of the key posts, including having served as finance secretary, and education secretary, so will know what is expected of those he appoints to serve under him.\n\nA new Scottish cabinet could be announced as early as Thursday, with all eyes on what post could be given to Kate Forbes, who like Mr Swinney has previously been in charge of the finance brief for the Scottish Government.\n\nShe had ran to be SNP leader and first minister when Nicola Sturgeon stepped down, coming a close second to Humza Yousaf.\n\nMs Forbes is amongst a group of SNP MSPs who have spoken out against several of the policies pursued and promoted by the Scottish Greens while in government, such as gender recognition reforms, which were blocked by Westminster, and highly protected marine areas, a policy which was ditched by the Scottish Government after attracting criticism from the fishing sector and others.\n\nWhile Ms Forbes refused to serve in Mr Yousaf's cabinet team, bringing her back into the heart of government could help appease those within the SNP who had been concerned about the role the Greens played in power.\n\nWith the powersharing agreement with the Greens no longer in place, Mr Swinney will be forced to lead a minority government at Holyrood.\n\nAs part of this role he will have to work with other parties in the Scottish Parliament on an issue by issue basis if he wants legislation to be passed by Holyrood.\n\nHe acknowledged this when he announced he was running for the SNP leadership, saying his party must now \"work to seek common ground in the Scottish Parliament in the interests of the public and of good governance\".\n\nMr Swinney added that as a result, the party's approach in Holyrood would \"have to change, to listen, to compromise, to work with all other political parties\".\n\nAs new SNP leader he will have lead his party in what could likely prove to be a difficult general election campaign later this year.\n\nPolls suggest the SNP could lose seats at Westminster, with the party facing a challenge from a revived Scottish Labour Party in the battle for votes.\n\nMeanwhile his appointment comes as the Police Scotland probe into the SNP's finances continues, with the new party leader also having to deal with any further political fallout from that.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"},

With his own party two votes short of a Holyrood majority, Yousaf found himself unable to garner sufficient cross-party support.\n\nSwinney, who was the deputy first minister to Sturgeon during the Covid pandemic, is highly respected across the party, and previously served as SNP leader from 2000 to 2004.\n\nHe faces the ongoing challenge of passing bills and budgets as a minority government, as well as polling that suggests support for the SNP is slumping and heavy losses are likely at the coming general election at the hands of a resurgent Labour party.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "severin_carrell@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Severin Carrell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Labour_Party_leadership_election_(UK)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2015 Labour Party leadership election (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Brown_(Scottish_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keith Brown (Scottish politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Conservatives", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Conservatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deputy First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/985c1572e212a5beaa0102872f4425fb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

John Swinney was elected Monday, May 6, 2024 as leader of the SNP after no other candidates came forward. (Jane Barlow/PA via AP, File)\n\nLONDON (AP) -- Scotland's former deputy first minister, John Swinney, was confirmed Monday as head of the Scottish National Party and is expected to become the country's next leader, its third in just over a year.\n\nSwinney, who led the SNP two decades ago, was the only candidate to replace First Minister Humza Yousaf as the leader of the party that has been in turmoil since long-serving First Minister Nicola Sturgeon abruptly stepped down last year during a campaign finance investigation that eventually led to criminal charges against her husband.\n\n\"I am deeply honored to have been elected as leader of @theSNP,\" Swinney said on social media platform X. \"I will give all that I have to serve my party and my country.\"\n\nYousaf announced his resignation last week after a political miscalculation in which he booted the Green Party from his coalition government. The SNP is one seat short of a majority in the local parliament with 63 of the 128 voting seats, so it needs to partner with at least one opposition party.\n\nSwinney, 60, who joined the party at age 15, will try to bring stability to the SNP as it fights efforts by its foes to weaken it going into U.K.-wide parliamentary elections expected later this year.\n\nThe Labour Party launched a no-confidence motion against Yousaf that failed last week after he said he would step down.\n\nThe pro-independence SNP was weakened by the campaign finance scandal and divisions over transgender rights, but was ultimately brought down by Yousaf's decision to oust the Greens because of differences over climate change goals. Yousaf was unable to persuade other parties to back his minority government in Scotland's parliament.\n\nFacing the prospect of two no-confidence votes that had been scheduled, Yousaf quit rather than be forced out.\n\nHe will remain first minister until his replacement is elected. Swinney is likely to be elevated to that position later this week after potential challengers to his bid to lead the SNP said they would not run against him.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

We should be seeking solutions to problems.\n\n\"I will reach out to everyone willing to join with us in good faith and seek compromises that serve our nation well. We need to stop shouting at each other and talk. More than that, actually, we need to listen. As first minister, I will do exactly that.\"\n\nMr Swinney praised the \"grace and dignity\" of his predecessor, and said \"moral leadership on the issue of Gaza has been a light in very dark times\".\n\nHe thanked Mr Yousaf for his contribution to the SNP and for his work as First Minister, and said he expected him to play a part in Scottish politics.\n\nMr Swinney said: \"We must continue to illuminate hope, fight for international justice and be willing to stand up for what we believe to be right. That is what Humza Yousaf did.\n\n\"I know that Humza will continue to make a substantial contribution to the public life of Scotland and I thank him for all that he has done as our party leader and First Minister.\"\n\n- Relations with SNP figures including Kate Forbes\n\nMr Swinney addressed relations with other factions within the SNP and said he had met ex-finance secretary Kate Forbes to discuss her views.\n\nHe thanked Ms Forbes for backing his leadership, and said during a meeting that the former opponents \"came together and discussed the shared ambitions we have for our country and how best to go forward\".\n\nMr Swinney added: \"The simple lesson is that dialogue can bring us to points of agreement and strength.\"\n\nResponding to questions following his speech, Mr Swinney said he will not resurrect the defunct powersharing deal between the SNP and the Scottish Greens, known as the Bute House Agreement.\n\nHe said he would not implement that type of agreement, preferring to take issues on a case-by-case basis.\n\nMr Swinney said: \"I don't intend to return to the Bute House Agreement.\"\n\nMr Swinney said the party would \"get our act together\" and win back disaffected voters.\n\nHe said the \"country could do more if we had the powers of a normal independent nation\", and cited Brexit and the cost-of-living crisis as examples of Westminster decisions \"that are bad for Scotland\".\n\nMr Swinney said: \"They demonstrate why Scotland needs to have independence to make our own decisions and create our best future.\"\n\nTo rapturous applause, he said: \"If someone is an independence supporter in Scotland and they they want Scotland to be independent there's only one political party that will ever deliver and that's the Scottish National Party.\"\n\n- The Cass Review into gender identity services for young people will be 'listened to' amid pledges of a 'rational' approach\n\nMr Swinney described the Cass Review as \"evidence based\", and pledged to listen to clinicians.\n\nHe added: \"The Government will take a rational evidence based approach to the consideration of the Cass Review.\n\n\"On matters of such sensitivity about the wellbeing of children and young people we should listen to clinicians.\"", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [],

last year's contest, won by the current First Minister Humza Yousaf, cost \u00a3180,000, an expense the party won't want in a general election year.\n\nOver the weekend, Mr Swinney told Sky TV: \"Bluntly, I would just like to get on with that as quickly as I possibly can do.\n\n\"Every day we spend on an internal contest, which I think we all probably know the outcome of, we delay the ability of the SNP to start rebuilding.\"\n\nHe also told the BBC: \"Obviously the party has got internal democracy it has got to go through, and nominations close at noon - we will find out then if there are any more candidates than me contesting the election to be the next SNP leader.\n\nScottish politics is never dull - The Steamie newsletter will give you the best analysis\n\n\"But of course it is the democratic right of members of the party to come forward, there are thresholds of support they have to pass, and if it is the case we will have a contest - and I think the overwhelming majority of party members want us to get on with it.\"\n\nThis morning the party's deputy party leader Keith Brown told BBC Good Morning Scotland: \"That's the nature of internal party democracy, it is an open competition.\n\n\"But it is the case that John Swinney is the sole nominee, and having that conversation [with Graeme McCormick] going well shows he can engage with all parts of the party and parliament, which is really important for a minority government.\"", "source": {"uri": "scotsman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scotsman"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_amery@scotsman.com", "name": "Rachel Amery", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deputy First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2010 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_UK", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky UK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Brown_(Scottish_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keith Brown (Scottish politician)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.scotsman.com/webimg/b25lY21zOjE5MzViNzNhLWYxNmYtNGQzZi1hOTFmLTU2MTJkZTUwNzIyNzoxOTkyYWJjYi02MzA2LTRjNzItYjk5Mi02NDdkN2YwZjFlMzY=.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

There has been some expression of concern that Mr Swinney may have ceded too much authority to Ms Forbes as a condition for her not standing against him.\n\nWhile replacing Shona Robison may signal disapproval of the December Budget, it may be significant that the current Finance Secretary was not present today or at last week's event.\n\nMinisters who did attend today's address included Angela Constance, M\u00e0iri McAllan, Neil Gray, Shirley-Anne Somerville and Jamie Hepburn.\n\nMr Swinney was the only nomination for party leader after persuading a potential rival not to stand. Veteran SNP activist Graeme McCormick had gathered the required number of signatures to mount a challenge. He withdrew following talks with Mr Swinney on Sunday evening.\n\nIn an acceptance speech in Glasgow, the new leader called for a more constructive approach to politics but acknowledged that he had contributed to hostilities in the parliament. He has been rebuked on numerous times by the presiding officer after aggressive outbursts during debates.\n\n\"I've obviously contributed to that [the divisiveness], of course, I have,\" he told reporters, adding that politics is in \"the worst state I've ever seen\". He said \"I'm here to do something about that.\"\n\nMr Swinney, who led the SNP between 2000 and 2004, said he envisaged a country where \"people have good jobs, the climate is protected, the vulnerable are lifted up and opportunity is available for all\".\n\nHe has pledged to continue putting the case for independence but again he called for a reasoned approach from both sides of the argument.\n\n\"I will always seek, with respect and courtesy, to persuade people of the case for independence. All I ask of those that oppose that vision, is that they also act with the same courtesy and respect,\" he said.\n\n\"That means independence is not a reason for them to refuse to work with us to build the economy, support jobs and improve the health service.\"\n\nHe said he did not intend to reinstate the power-sharing Bute House Agreement with the Scottish Greens. The botched termination of the deal led to Humza Yousaf's resignation.\n\nMr Swinney said his predecessor had \"conducted himself throughout this year in office \"with grace and with dignity\".\n\nBusiness leaders representing tourism, retail and the broader spectrum of industry predictably welcomed his commitment to economic growth.\n\nSome have also noted that in his leadership launch speech last Thursday and today's address he has already blamed Westminster for limiting the scope of his government.\n\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: \"We urge him to govern for all of Scotland by abandoning his relentless push for independence - but, judging by his leadership launch slogan, that looks a forlorn hope.\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said: \"John Swinney's coronation is entirely about managing the SNP rather than running our country and delivering for Scotland.\n\n\"At a time when Scotland is crying out for change, the SNP is offering more of the same.\"\n\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said: \"It's hardly a good look for senior SNP parliamentarians to have to beg a party activist to step aside and allow a coronation because of the expense of a leadership election.\n\n\"John Swinney will now take the top role without any discussion of his preferred policies at all aside from breaking up the UK.\"", "source":

Ash Regan ended her \"reasonable letter\" to First Minister Humza Yousaf with the words \"the opportunity to write a new chapter for Scotland is in our hands\", revealing her expectation that she, as Alex's and Alba's representative, would be pulling the Scottish Government's strings if Humza were to rely on Ash's vote to survive as FM.\n\nThis was a huge opportunity lost for Alex and Alba which could have been seen to be working with the SNP, instead of against them (an impression compounded by Ash's vote to bring down the SNP Scottish Government). Such a changed perception would have encouraged many SNP voters to give their second preferences to Alba in the next Holyrood election, rather than the Scottish Greens who seemingly allowed personal recriminations, rather than the goal of independence, to dictate their intended actions on a vote of no confidence in the FM.\n\nAs for the resultant leadership contest, Alex has already been attempting to influence the SNP by blaming the \"old guard\" (alternatively read \"SNP establishment\", \"senior members of the party\" or \"continuity forces\") for his failed gamble, and regrettably some SNP supporters appear to be falling into this narrative with regard to electing a new leader of the SNP and first minister.\n\nFrom a non-party-affiliated perspective, much as I admire the talents of Kate Forbes, it would seem Kate has made a wise decision not to contest the party leadership at this time. With the Scottish Greens still looking to manipulate the Scottish Government towards a more radical green agenda, with the police investigation still hanging over the SNP and with a General Election looming, it seems a pragmatic leadership approach might best serve the immediate interests of both the SNP and the wider Yes movement.\n\nREAD MORE: SNP activist seeking to challenge John Swinney for party leadership\n\nPerhaps ideally, if achievable, a joint leadership of the party could be promoted temporarily embracing parliamentary representation at both Holyrood and Westminster. Should it be possible to elect a joint leadership of perhaps John Swinney and Stephen Flynn, with the former as FM and the able Kate as Deputy FM (returning to government in a senior ministerial role), then good stable government can be achieved at Holyrood while Stephen, with more authority in the party, can step up the campaign for independence through the coming General Election.\n\nShould the SNP win the most seats at that election then as co-leader of the party, he can immediately seek talks with the new Westminster government on progressing Scotland's democratic rights through devolving the power to hold a constitutional referendum to Holyrood, or if a majority of votes was achieved, begin independence negotiations. Should either of these aims not progress quickly, then a Constitutional Convention should guide the way forward, preferably ahead of the next Holyrood election.\n\nGiven the apparent lack of commitment shown to independence by the Scottish Greens and without a significant change of tack from Alba, the question of second preferences at that election arises.\n\nREAD MORE: John Swinney: Leadership challenge from SNP activist will 'delay' rebuild\n\nFor those SNP supporters predicting doom and gloom, their second preferences should probably also go to the SNP so as to offset possible lost constituency seats with more list seats. For those more optimistic SNP supporters, if one of the Yes groups, such as Liberation Scotland (of which Salvo is the campaigning arm aiming to restore Scotland's constitution) could, as a \"party\", put up candidates across Scotland at the next Holyrood election, then even if the direct votes for the SNP were reduced, a majority for independence could still be achieved. And subsequently, the necessary steps to self-determination could be taken - in spite of the combined efforts of the UK mainstream media and the London-centric Labour, Tory and LibDem parties.\n\nIn the meantime, perhaps the SNP should shift their focus from the moral, democratic, economic and social failures of the Tories at Westminster (through policies in the main tacitly supported by the Labour Party) to the SNP's many successes relative to the Brexit-supporting Labour Party. From Glasgow with the long-overdue equal pay award to other local authorities across Scotland not blighted by horrendously expensive PFI schemes. A country now free of most bridge and hospital parking tolls and with a new bridge across the Forth. A country delivering many social and educational benefits not provided in the rest of the UK. And one with regressive policies - introduced by a UK Government pursuing an austerity agenda - mitigated against.\n\nA country where life under the SNP is better, on nearly every directly comparable measure, than in Wales under the Labour Party, including in areas such as health and education, as well as in renewable energy generation and on making progress towards net zero.", "source": {"uri":

That essentially makes him the next first minister in waiting after Humza Yousaf's resignation.\n\nIn his pitch to SNP members on Thursday, Mr Swinney pledged to unite his party and strongly hinted at a move away from working closely with the Greens, seen by some as on the far-left, to shifting back to the centre left of Scottish politics.\n\nIn his speech in Edinburgh, the former SNP deputy first minister said that \"only the SNP stand where the majority of people want their government to be, in the moderate centre-left of Scottish politics\", adding \"that is where I stand\".\n\nHe said: \"If elected by my party and by parliament, my goals as first minister will come straight from that moderate centre-left tradition - the pursuit of economic growth and of social justice.\"\n\nThat vow was a huge hint that he intends to move away from the SNP being aligned with the Greens, who do not take a traditional approach to economic growth - something the Scottish Government has received criticism for during its co-operation agreement with the Greens.\n\nIn a further veiled dig at policies brought forward in partnership with the Greens to tackle the climate crisis, Mr Swinney insisted that \"we need to recognise that the pursuit of net zero has to take people and business with us\".\n\nHe added: \"When resources are limited, they must be used forensically to make the greatest impact on the challenge we face.\"\n\nYesterday, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross urged the potential future first minister to rule out a deal with the Scottish Greens, who he called \"extreme\" and \"anti-economic growth\".\n\nIt remains unclear whether a key role in Mr Swinney's Cabinet for Kate Forbes, who the Greens have made no secret they will not work with over her socially conservative views on equalities, would sway their support for the new administration.\n\nOn Thursday, SNP Net Zero Secretary Mairi McAllan, who introduced Mr Swinney on stage as he launched his leadership bid, confirmed the Scottish Government will not pursue the inclusion of glass bottles in a future deposit return scheme - a key principle sought for by Greens co-leader Lorna Slater, who was previously responsible for the policy.\n\nSNP backbencher Fergus Ewing, a key critic of the Greens and the Bute House Agreement, told The Scotsman that his \"message to John Swinney\" was to \"stop being afraid of and forever pandering to these extremists\".\n\nHe added: \"The extremist Greens leave a legacy of disaster behind them of dud, damaging policies.\n\n\"The SNP Government must now scrap the remaining Green party-inspired policies that would cause even more misery and mayhem such as the heat in buildings bill which would see non-compliant homes becoming unsaleable, and mortgage interest rates in Scotland higher than rest of the UK.\"\n\nMr Ewing suggested that the Greens \"cannot in practice bring down a minority SNP government\", warning that \"they would then lose half their vote by infuriating the SNP voters who in the 2021 election gave them their second votes\".\n\nHe added: \"Their MSPs would then be wiped out. We should simply ignore the Greens. Let them go back to their wine bar to prepare for the revolution.\"\n\nBut a Scottish Greens source has told The Scotsman that a move to the centre is \"what we worried about when Humza ended the Bute House Agreement\".\n\nThe source added that \"some in the SNP appear to be in panic mode about the election, but this just sounds like net zero pledges would get watered down even more\".\n\nThe Greens insider suggested that the former coalition partners may not back up key priorities if they \"do not chime with what our MSPs were elected to fight for\".\n\nThe source added: \"If the SNP moves too far to the right, they would need to look elsewhere to get their policies and budgets passed. We are not here to simply endorse an SNP minority government.\n\n\"John has a history of working with pretty much everyone in government so perhaps he would look to other parties for some things he knows he wouldn't be keen on. That is up to him.\n\n\"The Greens are still committed to the principles that were put into the Bute House Agreement. If the SNP is no longer fussed about them, they will need to think about the support they get for getting things done.\"\n\nPolling expert Mark Diffley said that Mr Swinney \"has set his stall out quite clearly\" on wanting to hone in on core policy areas but warned \"that's easier said than done in a minority government\".\n\nHe said: \"The whole idea of the Bute House Agreement was to make their lives as easy as possible and they obviously don't have that kind of benefit anymore.\n\n\"There will be more focus on what polling tells us are the key considerations that voters have.\n\n\"People want the economy to improve, particularly at a time where people have been and many still are, going through the cost-of-living crisis. They also want to see better public services, most specifically the NHS.\"\n\nMr Diffley said Mr Swinney is likely to be \"laser-focused on the key issues\" that matter to the public, but warned that \"their performance over recent times has deteriorated\".\n\nRecent polling shows that only 36 per cent of the public think the Scottish Government is doing a good job on education and the NHS, with Mr Diffley stressing that was \"considerably higher in the days of Nicola Sturgeon\".\n\nThe polling expert also warned that polling from November shows that 61 per cent believe the SNP is divided, up from just 34 per cent in the space of 12 months.\n\nMr Diffley suggested that public perception of division \"highlights the challenge that Swinney will have\", as he looks to \"reset the agenda and focus on core issues\".\n\nThe Scottish Greens have not yet decided how to approach a government headed by Mr Swinney. The Perthshire North MSP has worked closely with the party before and played a key role in drawing up the Bute House Agreement under Ms Sturgeon's administration.\n\nIf the Greens were unable to support a minority SNP Government, Mr Swinney would need to appeal, potentially on a policy-by-policy basis, to Labour, the Conservatives and the Lib Dems, in order to pass legislation and budgets at Holyrood.\n\nA spokesperson for the Scottish Greens said: \"The leader of the SNP is a decision for SNP members.\n\n\"The Scottish Greens remain committed to the progressive values and climate action that were at the heart of the Bute House Agreement, and will continue working to deliver these through the Scottish Parliament and councils across the country.\n\n\"Once a vote is scheduled to elect the next first minister our MSPs will meet to discuss our next steps.\"", "source": {"uri": "scotsman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scotsman"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_bol@scotsman.com",

delay rebuild, says Swinney", "body": "John Swinney has argued a divisive SNP leadership contest could delay the party's essential \"rebuild\" amid reports a veteran activist could enter the race to replace Humza Yousaf.\n\nThe former deputy first minister could become SNP leader from Monday afternoon if he runs unopposed, with Mr Swinney stating he would like to get on with that job \"as quickly as possible\".\n\nHowever, reports suggest a leadership battle may be on the cards after activist Graeme McCormick used the independence march in Glasgow to drum up support for his candidacy.\n\nIt is understood Mr McCormick believes he is very likely to receive the 100 nominations from at least 20 SNP branches before the Monday deadline.\n\nMr McCormick has previously been critical of the SNP-led Scottish Government, using last year's party conference to criticise its independence strategy.\n\nIf he won the leadership race against Mr Swinney, he would not be able to become first minister as he is not elected in the Scottish Parliament, with Mr McCormick reportedly telling members he believes the roles should be run by two different individuals.\n\nBut, Mr Swinney, who at this point remains the only confirmed candidate, told the Sky News programme Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips he felt an internal contest would hamper the SNP's ability to recover from its turbulent period quickly.\n\nHe said: \"I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we have had, under my leadership, and bluntly, I'd just like to get on with that as quickly as I possible can do, because every day that we spend in an internal contest, which I think we all probably know the outcome of, we delay the possibility for the SNP to start its rebuilding.\"\n\nMr Swinney told the programme his leadership bid had received \"very, very comprehensive support\", including from former finance secretary Kate Forbes, who earlier ruled herself out of the contest.\n\nShould Mr McCormick receive the required nominations, a three-week leadership contest will be triggered, with ballots opening on Monday May 13 and closing on May 27.\n\nBut if Mr Swinney runs unopposed, he will be the next SNP leader and he will likely become first minister as early as next week after a Holyrood vote.\n\nMr Swinney, who previously led his party from 2000 to 2004, faced a leadership challenge from an activist in 2003 but ultimately won the contest with 83.9% of the vote.\n\nSpeaking later on BBC Scotland's the Sunday Show, he said he would respect the \"democratic process\" if there was a contest but added: \"I think it would be better if we just got on with things, that we started the rebuilding of the SNP and its political strength.\"\n\nHe added he thought the \"overwhelming majority\" of party members \"wanted to get on with it\".\n\nAsked where the party \"disunity\" came from, he cited the difficult leadership contest in 2023, which saw Mr Yousaf, Ms Forbes and Ash Regan, condemn each other's records and social views.\n\n\"I think we have basically just had a rough couple of years,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "glasgowtimes.co.uk",

Scotland's Next Leader", "body": "The SNP confirmed Swinney's election after nominations for the post closed at noon (1100 GMT) without any other challengers emerging.\n\nScottish political veteran John Swinney on Monday was named head of the pro-independence SNP party, leaving him poised to become Scotland's new leader.\n\nSwinney, 60, said on X, formerly Twitter, that he was \"deeply honoured to have been elected as leader of the SNP\" after Humza Yousaf resigned last week after little more than a year as Scottish leader and head of the Scottish National Party (SNP).\n\nThe SNP confirmed Swinney's election after nominations for the post closed at noon (1100 GMT) without any other challengers emerging.\n\nHe told reporters later that alongside advancing the case for Scottish independence his key policy idea was the eradication of child poverty.\n\n\"It is a curse and under my leadership, I want to eradicate it in Scotland,\" he said.\n\nOn independence, he said the party would \"get our act together\" to win back the votes of supporters who may have turned away from the party in recent years.\n\nHumza stepped down last Monday as he faced a confidence vote in the Scottish parliament that he was set to lose having ditched his junior coalition partners, the Scottish Green Party, in a row over climate policy.\n\nSwinney, an old party hand who led the SNP from 2000 to 2004 when the nationalists were in opposition, will now face a vote in the Scottish parliament later this week.\n\nBut he inherits a difficult political legacy, with former SNP leader and ally Nicola Sturgeon embroiled in a party funding scandal and a challenging domestic policy landscape.\n\nCritics have accused the SNP, in power in Edinburgh for 17 years, of focusing on pursuing independence at the expense of issues like the cost-of-living crisis and health.\n\nThe party has struggled to rebuild momentum for another independence vote since Scotland voted against leaving the UK in a referendum in 2014.\n\nSupport for independence, meanwhile, has since fallen to between 41 and 43 per cent, according to three opinion polls taken in April.\n\nWith the SNP heading a minority government in the 129-seat Scottish parliament, Swinney will need the support of another party to form a governing coalition or to pass legislation.\n\nBut he said he would not resurrect the defunct powersharing deal between the SNP and the Scottish Greens, known as the Bute House Agreement.\n\n\"I don't intend to return to the Bute House Agreement,\" he said, adding that he preferred to take issues on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe government is currently two votes short of an overall majority, only surviving the no-confidence vote brought by the Labour opposition last week thanks to the backing of the Greens.\n\nThe ructions in the SNP are being closely watched in London, ahead of a UK general election later this year.\n\nThe SNP currently holds 43 seats in the UK parliament.\n\nThe UK's main Labour opposition is hoping for a resurgence in its former stronghold north of the English border to help it win an outright majority in the general election.\n\nThe Scottish Parliament, re-established in 1999, has limited powers to set policy in areas such as health, education, transport and the environment.\n\nThe UK government in London retains powers for countrywide issues such as defence and foreign policy.", "source": {"uri": "channelstv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Channels Television"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_jones_usen@channelstv.com", "name": "Tom Jones Usen",

Some stretch the definition of news. I was particularly struck by one bulletin this week. It purported to offer a \"one-month lookahead\" to events in the Scottish Parliament. How bold, I thought. Such courage. In the past week, events at Holyrood have been so fluid that, at various points, one would have hesitated to set out a prospectus for the next hour.\n\nMidweek, I chanced to be in Holyrood's Garden Lobby as the turmoil swirled. From Opposition parties, a sense of grim determination. From the SNP, the slipping smile of disquiet and fear.\n\nAt which point enter John Swinney, declining, as he put it, to walk on by. He cut a deal with Kate Forbes, he declared his intention to refocus party and government closer to the centre of politics. This scenario, this succession, is pretty much the last thing Mr Swinney envisaged.\n\nThe last time around: Scottish National Party leader John Swinney thanks supporters after being elected by a margin of two to one over rival candidate Alex Neil at the SNP conference at the Eden Court Theatre in Inverness (Image: free)\n\nIn a curious way, it reminds me of the late Alistair Darling, the Labour Chancellor who confronted the banking crash and was then prevailed upon to lead the campaign against independence in 2014. Mr Darling was somewhat less than eager. He had to be cajoled. But, having agreed, he thrust himself into the contest with vigour and vim. (Nationalists will recall the outcome.)\n\nJohn Swinney had comparable doubts. What about his family? Was it not time to settle down - rather than leading the battle to settle up with the Union? Had he not looked to a \"new generation\" of Nationalists? And yet. The party he joined as a teenager was facing a genuine, full-blown crisis - partly from circumstance and partly from a blunder by Humza Yousaf in peremptorily ending the governing pact with the Greens.\n\nEn passant, let me say that Mr Yousaf contrived to leave office with a degree of dignity restored. He turned away from a prospective deal with Alba which he saw as more trouble than a single Holyrood vote was worth.\n\nAnd so the baton passes to John Swinney. During the period of SNP government, he has been a Minister for 16 years - and an observer for one year. That prolonged period in office gives him the experience to lead. That year, gazing on, gives him the perspective to conclude that the best-laid schemes had gone agley. Hence the reset. Hence the focus upon economic growth to raise revenue for improving public services. Hence the caveat to climate action - that Ministers must \"take people and business with us\". Hence the emphasis on popular concerns. So the NHS, education, justice. The cost of living, poverty. No mention whatsoever of gender issues and culture wars. Hence too the search for a more \"cohesive\" party.\n\nRead more by Brian Taylor\n\nHumza Yousaf could have survived but he shot himself in the foot\n\nHumza Yousaf faces a crisis - of his own making, says Brian Taylor\n\nAn intriguing term; broader, less glib than \"unity\". Under Nicola Sturgeon, there was muttering about government by coterie, by cabal. Somewhat unfair, I always felt, but there it is. Under Humza Yousaf, there was more open discontent, there was talk of drift, of indecision. Again, I think he was better than frequently depicted - but the times were against him.\n\nEnough, says Mr Swinney. Unity cannot be imposed. Leaders must be open to question. A cohesive party requires open discussion, with all sectors and wings co-operating. Including fretful MPs, who face an upcoming contest.\n\nBack to that \"look-ahead\" news release. Let us essay a similar endeavour for John Swinney, the unexpected leader.\n\nFirstly, he has to be confirmed as SNP chief when nominations close on Monday. I think he can be fairly confident. Kate Forbes scarcely provided an effusive declaration of support. Her disappointment was palpable. No appearance at the Swinney launch. Simply a written statement. But it was sufficient.\n\nHe had offered enough - on the economy, on climate action, on a new moderate focus - to win her backing. They had, she said, a \"powerful common purpose\". But will that common purpose survive and thrive in the clanjamfrie of Scottish politics?\n\nSecondly, in our lookahead, Mr Swinney has to be selected as Holyrood's nominee to the King for the post of First Minister. Again, I think he can be optimistic. For all the anxious talk, the SNP are the biggest party in Holyrood by a stretch. Who is entitled to occupy Bute House if not them?\n\nFurther, I think the Greens will follow the logic of their vote against the Labour motion of no confidence in the entire Scottish Government. They make a distinction between criticising Humza Yousaf individually - and bringing down the entire house of cards. I know some resent Green influence over the choice of SNP leader. The Greens made plain they could not work with Kate Forbes, given her views on moral matters.\n\nHow will the Greens react to the new political reality? (Image: free)\n\nHowever, I believe such angst is misplaced. The SNP are perfectly free to choose their own leader. The Greens are also free to outline the consequences. Welcome to realpolitik.\n\nOnce installed, Mr Swinney has to reshape his team, to focus upon his declared priorities. He has promised a \"significant\" role for the \"intelligent, creative, thoughtful\" Kate Forbes. A major portfolio? Something economic, with redrawn remits?\n\nThen, thirdly, it really starts. Mr Swinney's newly cohesive team has to work within a decidedly fragmented Parliament. He needs support - or, at least, tolerance - from other parties for legislation to pass. The Bute House agreement is no more. So he will seek deals on an individual basis with individual parties. Which is going to be tough. Especially when it comes to the annual budget, the vote which defines an administration.\n\nUnder Bute House, the Greens agreed to endorse \"supply\" - aka cash. No more. And they will not welcome Mr Swinney's words. Their talk this week was still of fiscal redistribution, not wealth creation. But perhaps, in calmer times, talks might reopen. Or there could be a pitch to other parties. Not easy given their adherence to the Union. Enter George Adam, the SNP's Business Minister and the quintessence of guile.\n\nFinally, stage four for Mr Swinney. Convincing the people of Scotland that he is on their side. Ultimately, to advance the cause of independence. For now, though, the more immediate challenge. Political survival.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type":

A Glasgow-born son of immigrants from Pakistan and Kenya, Mr Yousaf was the first person from a minority ethnic background to become the First Minister of Scotland.\n\nThe move followed an abrupt end to a power-sharing agreement between his SNP and the Green Party last week, which ended with slim hopes that Mr Yousaf could lead a minority government.\n\n\"I am deeply honoured to have been elected as leader of @theSNP,\" Mr Swinney said on social media platform X. \"I will give all that I have to serve my party and my country.\"\n\nThat ballot could take place as early as Wednesday, with Mr Swinney likely to be officially in place in at the head of the Scottish Government the following day.\n\nMr Yousaf congratulated Mr Swinney as his successor as SNP leader and called on the party to heed his call for unity.\n\n\"Congratulations to @JohnSwinney on becoming leader of @theSNP and FM-elect,\" he wrote on X.\n\n\"John's central message has been one of unity. As a party, we must heed his call, whatever has happened in the past should remain there.\n\n\"Let's get behind John & his team so they can deliver for Scotland.\"\n\nThe party has been in turmoil since long-serving first minister Nicola Sturgeon abruptly stepped down last year during a campaign finance investigation that has led to criminal charges against her husband.\n\nMr Yousaf announced his resignation last week after a political miscalculation in which he threw the Green Party out his coalition government.\n\nThe SNP is one seat short of a majority in the devolved parliament with 63 of the 128 voting seats, so it needs to a partnership with at least one other party.\n\nMr Swinney, 60, who joined the party at the age of 15, said he will try to bring stability to the SNP as it fights efforts to weaken it as it prepares for UK-wide parliamentary elections expected later this year.\n\nThe Labour Party made a motion of no-confidence in Mr Yousaf that failed last week after he said he would step down.\n\nThe devolutionist SNP was weakened by the campaign finance scandal and divisions over transgender rights, but was ultimately brought down by Mr Yousaf's decision to oust the Greens because of differences over climate change goals.\n\nMr Yousaf was unable to persuade other parties to back his minority government in Scotland's parliament.\n\nFacing the prospect of two no-confidence votes that had been scheduled, Mr Yousaf quit rather than be forced out, saying he would remain First Minister until had replacement is elected.\n\nMr Swinney is likely to be elevated to that position later this week after potential challengers to his bid to lead the SNP said they would not run against him.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

It now heads a minority government in Holyrood.\n\nThe slide has boosted the hopes of Britain's opposition Labour Party of regaining ground in Scotland, one of the United Kingdom's four nations, as it seeks to win a British parliamentary election expected later this year.\n\nThe SNP aims to reinvigorate the push for another referendum on independence from the United Kingdom.\n\nScots voted against splitting from the United Kingdom by 55% against 45% in a referendum in 2014, but the independence movement says Britain's later departure from the European Union changed the situation and another referendum is justified - a claim that both the ruling Conservative Party and Labour reject.\n\n(Reporting by Muvija M, Editing by Bernadette Baum and Angus MacSwan)", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "swi_swissinfo_ch@swissinfo.ch", "name": "Swi Swissinfo.Ch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Party of England and Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brexit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deputy First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.swissinfo.ch/content/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2024/05/8e97bff01fcb5dac29d113485142edbc-77044281.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

But the party's seven MSPs could make life difficult for him by refusing to back SNP budgets and legislation.\n\nGreens co-leader Patrick Harvie has demanded that the new SNP leader re-commits to \"progressive policies\" to win their support, after Mr Yousaf's decision to tear up the coalition deal.\n\nMs Forbes' conservative Christian views could yet prove a sticking point. She opposed the failed move to make it easier for transgender people to self-identify, which was supported by the Greens, and previously said that she would have voted against legalising same-sex marriage.\n\nMr Harvie has said that he would not have been \"comfortable\" remaining as a minister if Ms Forbes had succeeded Ms Sturgeon as SNP leader last year.\n\nBut Mr Swinney plots how to unify his own divided party, one ally said there was confidence that the new leader could bring in Ms Forbes as his deputy while managing the relationship with the Greens.\n\nMs Forbes, who leads a group of social and fiscally-conservative MSPs pushing to ditch the policies of the Sturgeon era, held talks with Mr Swinney about a potential role last week.\n\nunderstands that has not told even her closest political allies which job has been discussed, although a senior cabinet role is expected.\n\nHowever, some allies believe she may not want the additional job as Deputy First Minister, in case any close association with Mr Swinney ruins a future leadership bid.\n\nGeoff Aberdein, Alex Salmond's former chief of staff, told that bringing in Ms Forbes as Deputy First Minister would be a smart move.\n\n\"If you really want to create an impression of a different with a renewed set of priorities, there would be no better way of doing that than bringing Kate Forbes in as his deputy.\"\n\nWarning that it may not be \"palatable\" to the Greens, Mr Aberdein added: \"It's up to John Swinney to find the issues where he can find support from other parties. He may have to compromise. But in politics that's not such a bad thing.\"\n\nAndy Maciver, the Scottish Tories' former media chief, told that Mr Swinney should \"give her any job she wants\". He added: \"He has to offer a clean break. Bringing Kate back is a way of starting to do that.\"\n\nPolling guru Prof John Curtice told that Mr Swinney faced a tricky balancing act in bringing in Ms Forbes to unite his party, while keeping the Greens onside for votes.\n\n\"Swinney's stock in the party is high,\" said Prof Curtice, adding: \"Keeping everyone happy is not going to be easy. A lot of SNP parliamentarians, let alone the Greens, burned their bridges with Kate Forbes last year.\"\n\nMr Swinney admitted at his acceptance speech at Glasgow University that the SNP has \"faced a rough time recently\", but insisted that it was \"coming back together again now\".\n\nHe told reporters he would \"reach out\" to the unionist parties. \"On some issues I'm sure we'll be aligned with the Scottish Greens, but I'm sure on other issues we'll have to find support and agreement with other political parties.\"\n\nMr Harvie said on Monday that the Greens were \"open to talks\" with Mr Swinney about offering support on certain issues.\n\nBut he warned Mr Swinney not to \"dilute\" or ditch existing legislative plans for rent control, a ban on conversion therapy, and new energy efficiency standards to encourage heat pump installation in homes.\n\n\"Will they offer a progressive vision for Scotland's future, or will they retreat toward the tepid middle ground, which would force them to rely on the Tories and other pro-union parties?\" said Mr Harvie.\n\nAlex Salmond, leader of the breakaway nationalist Alba Party, said Mr Swinney was \"not too clear on his strategy for independence\" during his acceptance speech.\n\nThe former First Minister urged the new SNP leader to ignore the Scottish Greens and reach out to single Alba MSP Ash Regan for support instead.\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said Mr Swinney's coronation had been \"stitch up by a chaotic and dysfunctional party that is more interested in protecting its own interests\".\n\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Mr Swinney was \"joined at the hip with the disgraced Nicola Sturgeon\", while Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton

The SNP does not have a majority in Parliament and will likely need to look to other parties for support to pass legislation - not least to ensure its new leader is elected first minister.\n\nGiven the acrimony between parties at Holyrood, the pro-independence Greens seem the most likely party to work with the SNP.\n\nBut Mr Ross said Green MSPs should not be appointed as ministers - as had been the case under the Bute House Agreement - and he called on the Scottish Government to commit to support new oil and gas licences in the North Sea and to \"major road upgrades\", such as dualling the A9 and A96.\n\nMs Mackay earlier said a new Bute House Agreement, or similar deal, was \"very, very unlikely\" to come to fruition under Mr Swinney.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Ms Mackay said: \"I think the likelihood is that we will be engaging on an issue-by-issue basis with whoever it is that is in the first minister's seat in the coming weeks.\"\n\nThe Central MSP added: \"We're still looking for the progressive policy package we agreed on in the Bute House Agreement, and delivering on things like rent controls and my Bill on safe access zones around abortion services. I would like to see these recommitted to by any new first minister.\n\n\"It is not certain it will be John [Swinney], but we have worked with him as part of government before. But there are several things we need to see.\"\n\nMs Mackay was also asked about the prospect of Ms Forbes being made deputy first minister under Mr Swinney. Ms Forbes has come under criticism for her socially conservative views on gay marriage and abortions, some of the causes championed by the Scottish Greens.\n\nMs Mackay said: \"There's obviously a great divide between myself and Kate on a variety of issues. It depends on what goes with that deputy first minister portfolio - there's certainly things we would be more or less inclined to look on favourably, but that's something we have to watch and wait over the coming weeks to see if Cabinet shakes out.\"\n\nPreviously the Greens were expected to support the Government in Holyrood as part of their power-sharing deal, which was signed by former first minister Nicola Sturgeon and Green co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater back in 2021.\n\nHowever, last week Humza Yousaf ended that agreement and threw the two Green ministers out of government, kick-starting the chain of events that would eventually lead to his resignation.\n\nMr Ross's comments came after one of the most senior ministers in Humza Yousaf's Government said SNP members did not want a repeat of the \"bruising\" leadership election of last year.\n\nNet zero secretary Mairi McAllan, who introduced Mr Swinney at his campaign launch in Edinburgh on Thursday, said the Perthshire North MSP was the \"right man\" to unite the party.\n\nMs McAllan said: \"There is a sense within the party that the last contest was a particularly bruising one, and I think there is absolutely a sense among members and activists that many of us would not wish to see that repeated.\n\n\"I think what the biggest deciding factor has been so far is the stature of John Swinney as somebody who has come forward. He is well loved and respected within our party, and I think, most importantly actually, he commands the trust and confidence of the people of Scotland, which we in the SNP know is exactly what is needed right now.\"", "source": {"uri": "scotsman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scotsman"}, "authors": [{"uri": "craig_paton@scotsman.com", "name": "Craig Paton", "type": "author",

just 15 of 43 seats with Labour set to overtake in Scotland: poll", "body": "The SNP will retain just 15 of its current 43 seats at the forthcoming general election, according to a new poll for the Sunday Times.\n\nThe forecast comes as Humza Yousaf announced his resignation as First Minister on Monday after he abruptly ended the Bute House Agreement with the Scottish Green Party.\n\nThe Sunday Times poll, by Norstat - formerly known as Panelbase, is one of the first of its kind since Mr Yousaf announced his resignation, and looked at voting intentions for both Westminster and Holyrood.\n\nIt found that while support for independence remains largely unchanged, Labour is set to overtake the SNP at both Westminster and Holyrood, bringing an end to the SNP's streak of four consecutive election victories.\n\nThe survey comes as John Swinney is now expected to become first minister on Tuesday, provided no other challengers enter the race.\n\nWhen asked who would make the best first minister from a list of SNP candidates, Mr Swinney and Kate Forbes were neck and neck with the public on 23%, although Ms Forbes has said she will not be standing.\n\nThe SNP vote share in a Westminster election would fall to its lowest level since the 2014 independence referendum, the poll says.\n\nThe party would hold just 15 of its 43 seats with Scottish Labour winning 28 - a dramatic increase from its current two.\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times poll, the SNP would attract votes from 29% of the electorate - a fall of three points in a month, while Labour's share increased by two points to 34%.\n\nThis would return 15 SNP MPs and amount to a significant reversal in electoral performance.\n\nUnder Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP became the third largest party at Westminster, winning 56 of 59 Scottish seats in 2015.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives, whose vote share remained at 16% in the poll, would add three seats to return nine MPs - while the Liberal Democrats, on 8%, would boost their yield by one to five MPs.\n\nSupport for independence remains evenly balanced, with 48% in favour of Scotland leaving the UK and 52% backing the Union.\n\nVoting intentions at Holyrood show the SNP remains a point ahead of Labour in the constituency vote at 34%.\n\nThe Conservatives would pick up 14% of the vote, the Lib Dems 9% and the Greens 5% - with the remaining 5% to other parties.\n\nBut Scottish Labour has edged a point ahead of the SNP on the more proportional regional list vote with the nationalists' return of 27%.\n\nThe Tories would win 17% of regional votes, the Greens 9%, Lib Dems 8%, Reform UK 6% and Alex Salmond's Alba Party 4%.\n\nAn analysis by polling expert Sir John Curtice for the Sunday Times found that this result would leave Labour as the largest party at Holyrood with 40 seats.\n\nThe remainder of the chamber would be 38 for the SNP, 24 Conservatives, 10 Greens, nine Lib Dems and eight Reform parliamentarians.\n\nThis would mark a historic breakthrough for Nigel Farage's party in Scotland as it at least partially replicates its gains in England by attracting some older, Brexit-supporting Tories north of the border.\n\nHe added: \"Even among those who said they would vote Yes in another independence referendum, only 56% said they were now willing to back the SNP for Westminster, as would only two-thirds who voted for the party in 2019.\"\n\nNorstat interviewed 1,086 people aged 16 or over in Scotland between April 30 and May 3.\n\nSNP depute leader Keith Brown commented: \"After 14 years of cruel Tory governments inflicting endless damage on Scotland and Keir Starmer's Labour offering no meaningful alternative, it's clear only the SNP and independence offers a better future for our country.\n\n\"The SNP is the only party standing up for the priorities of people across Scotland and offering a positive vision for the future where decisions about Scotland are made in Scotland.\n\n\"At the general election Scottish voters have the chance to reject the cosy status quo of a broken Westminster system that is failing them and vote to elect SNP MPs who will always stand up for their interests\".", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

member's bid to enter SNP race", "body": "The former deputy first minister could become SNP leader from Monday afternoon if he runs unopposed, with Mr Swinney stating he would like to get on with that job \"as quickly as possible\".\n\nHowever, a leadership battle may be on the cards after member Graeme McCormick, a figure unknown outside the party and some Yes activists, used the independence march in Glasgow to drum up support for his candidacy.\n\nIt is understood Mr McCormick believes he is very likely to receive the 100 nominations from at least 20 SNP branches before the Monday deadline.\n\nMr McCormick has previously been critical of the SNP-led Scottish Government, using last year's party conference to criticise its independence strategy.\n\nIf he won the leadership race against Mr Swinney, he would not be able to become first minister as he is not elected in the Scottish Parliament, with Mr McCormick reportedly telling members he believes the roles should be run by two different individuals.\n\nBut, Mr Swinney, who at this point remains the only confirmed candidate, told the Sky News programme Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips he felt an internal contest would hamper the SNP's ability to recover from its turbulent period quickly.\n\nHe said: \"I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we have had, under my leadership, and bluntly, I'd just like to get on with that as quickly as I possible can do, because every day that we spend in an internal contest, which I think we all probably know the outcome of, we delay the possibility for the SNP to start its rebuilding.\"\n\nMr Swinney told the programme his leadership bid had received \"very, very comprehensive support\", including from former finance secretary Kate Forbes, who earlier ruled herself out of the contest.\n\nShould Mr McCormick receive the required nominations, a three-week leadership contest will be triggered, with ballots opening on Monday May 13 and closing on May 27.\n\nBut if Mr Swinney runs unopposed, he will be the next SNP leader and he will likely become first minister as early as next week after a Holyrood vote.\n\nMr Swinney, who previously led his party from 2000 to 2004, faced a leadership challenge from an activist in 2003 but ultimately won the contest with 83.9% of the vote.\n\nSpeaking later on BBC Scotland's the Sunday Show, he said he would respect the \"democratic process\" if there was a contest but added: \"I think it would be better if we just got on with things, that we started the rebuilding of the SNP and its political strength.\"\n\nHe added he thought the \"overwhelming majority\" of party members \"wanted to get on with it\".\n\nAsked where the party \"disunity\" came from, he cited the difficult leadership contest in 2023, which saw Mr Yousaf, Ms Forbes and Ash Regan, condemn each other's records and social views.\n\n\"I think we have basically just had a rough couple of years,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party",

Parliament, where he will need to win the support of MSPs.\n\nIt is likely other party leaders could put themselves forward for the ballot, though it is in reality unlikely that they would be successful in this.\n\nHowever for Mr Swinney to win the vote in Holyrood, which could take place as early as Wednesday, he will need some MSPs from opposition parties to either back him in the vote, or at least abstain.\n\nThe support of Scottish Greens therefore could still be crucial going forward, in this vote and in others to come at Holyrood.\n\nAssuming he wins the vote, Mr Swinney will then become the Scottish Parliament's nominated candidate to be the country's seventh first minister.\n\nAfter that he would be formally appointed via a royal warrant, a legal document that is authorised by the King.\n\nFollowing that he would officially be sworn into the post in a ceremony at the Court of Session in Edinburgh by the Lord President, Scotland's most senior judge.\n\nHe will also have to appoint his his ministerial team of cabinet secretaries and junior ministers, with much attention on what position will go to Kate Forbes.\n\nThe former Holyrood finance secretary had been tipped as a possible challenger to Mr Swinney for the SNP leadership, but announced on Thursday she would not stand and would instead back the former deputy first minister in his bid for the top job.\n\nMr Swinney, in announcing his candidacy sought to praise Ms Forbes, who last year ran Mr Yousaf a close second in the contest to succeed Nicola Sturgeon, and giving her a top post in his cabinet team would be seen as a move towards restoring unity within the different factions of the SNP.\n\nMs Forbes has been out of the Scottish cabinet since then, but could return to a senior post under Mr Swinney.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Leadership nominations will close at noon tomorrow.\n\nMs Forbes is a divisive figure among sections of the party with some not agreeing with her views\n\nJohn Swinney is set to reward Kate Forbes for not challenging his leadership bid\n\nIt was also claimed yesterday that Mr Swinney is prepared to sack Ministers as part of a slimmed-down government.\n\nIt is thought that current Deputy First Minister and Finance Secretary Shona Robison may be moved from her current role.\n\nThe SNP was thrown into a state of flux when Humza Yousaf announced last Monday that he was resigning as First Minister - and a party source said: 'The SNP is now a deeply divided party, with sides who are miles apart.\n\n'There are those more traditional in their views and those who like to describe themselves as the \"progressive\" side of the party.\n\n'One side are interested in policies that affect the lives of many, such as the economy and the NHS, while the other is into identity politics and fixated on niche policies like gender reform. The result is deep division.'\n\nThe source added: 'Clearly, John Swinney is the continuity figure, given his closeness to Humza Yousaf and Nicola Sturgeon, who remains a huge influence.\n\nKate Forbes is close to others and John has agreed to have her on the inside, with the signal it sends that she, and those loyal to her, have a relevance.\n\n'The problem is that she is so unpopular with some, including many who absolutely cannot and will not tolerate her, that there is a tangible risk that the whole thing could blow up.'\n\nA further party source said: 'Deals are what happens in politics and this one makes sense, because Kate is a class act and everyone knows that - even those who might not agree with her views.\n\n'Having someone with her intelligence at your side would be invaluable. She is well known for her clear views but she is smart and it's hoped she can bring the different sides together.'\n\nSpeaking last week, Mr Swinney described Ms Forbes as his 'colleague and friend', adding that she is an 'intelligent, creative, thoughtful person who has much to contribute to our national life'.\n\nHe added: 'If elected, I will make sure Kate is able to make that contribution.'\n\nThe possibility of her becoming his deputy, however, would almost certainly lead to a terminal rift with the Scottish Greens.\n\nAnother party source said: 'The fallout from the split with the Greens remains a big problem and some want to appease them, while others want them cut adrift.\n\n'Having Kate as deputy won't exactly help get them back on board, and then you have a problem with numbers when it comes to getting things done.\n\n'However, the overriding feeling is that Kate is a smart operator and having her as deputy would be a sensible move - not least given the lack of viable alternatives.'\n\nThere are currently 26 Scottish Ministers, but Mr Swinney and Ms Forbes are understood to be united in favouring a more 'concentrated' group.\n\nSome Ministers, including those now worried about their political futures, have already privately voiced concerns - even before any official announcement over her appointment - that too much power has been conceded to Ms Forbes.\n\nIt was also reported yesterday that sources close to Mr Swinney expect him to 'park' policies that proved to be unpopular during the Green-SNP Bute House power sharing deal, which saw Green co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater handed Ministerial positions.\n\nMr Swinney has played down talk of any imminent independence referendum, saying that the party must firstly 'win more hearts and minds.'\n\nWhile pragmatists in his party may welcome the stance, it will inevitably spark unease among those for whom independence is the priority.\n\nMr Swinney also rejected suggestions that he would be an 'interim' or 'caretaker' leader. One of his senior Ministers appeared to suggest this may not be the case, with Economy Secretary Mairi McAllan saying that Mr Swinney was the right man 'for the moment'.\n\nYesterday Mr Swinney declined to confirm any new position for Ms Forbes, saying: 'Any discussion of appointments to Government before the election of the First Minister is entirely premature.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deputy First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Secretary_for_Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet Secretary for Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Mail_(Scotland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunday Mail (Scotland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shona_Robison", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shona Robison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Identity politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00e0iri_McAllan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e0iri McAllan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorna_Slater", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lorna Slater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Scottish_independence_referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2014 Scottish independence referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bute_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bute House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Harvie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Harvie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/04/19/84460381-0-image-m-23_1714848740508.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The 2022 Supreme Court dismissal of the bid to hold a second referendum has left the party without a clear way forward.\n\nThe polling shows that voters in Scotland have been firmly deadlocked on the question for several years now, remaining roughly 50-50 throughout the turmoil of Brexit and Covid. There is little on the horizon that would seem likely to shift the dial.\n\nIn a noticeable change in tone from Humza Yousaf, who quit as SNP leader and First Minister, Mr Swinney appears to be realistic about the immediate years ahead.\n\nHe refused to repeat Mr Yousaf's claim that winning a majority of seats at the general election would mean a mandate for another referendum, saying he would focus on a back-to basics campaign to persuade Scots of independence's merits.\n\nHe also said a \"really convincing and demonstrable increase\" in polling was needed to push the UK government into agreeing to another referendum. The SNP veteran told Sky News: \"It's not supported by enough people for it to be a compelling proposition within Scotland.\"\n\nIs that sort of attitude good enough for independence activists, inside and outside of the SNP?\n\nMr Swinney may not get the chance to breeze into the top job without a fresh debate on the subject. An obscure SNP activist called Graeme McCormick could throw a spanner in works.\n\nIf Mr McCormick gets the 100 signatures across 20 branches required by noon on Monday, it would mean the strategy for separation is openly scrutinised during a three-week contest.\n\nThe activist, who used a weekend pro-independence march in Glasgow to drum up support, attacked the party's approach to independence at last year's conference - calling it \"flatulence in a trance\".\n\nAside from his uphill battle on the big constitutional question, Mr Swinney faces a more pressing struggle to win votes in the Scottish Parliament while leading a minority government.\n\nThe pro-independence Scottish Greens remain bitter at the manner in which the coalition deal was ripped up under Mr Yousaf, and will be determined to show their own voter base that they are not at Holyrood just to nod through SNP policies.\n\nMr Swinney said on Sunday that he could \"probably\" win the support of the unionist parties - Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats - to pass budgets and get other things done.\n\nBut their antipathy towards the SNP, and their desperation to get the nationalists out of office, is now fiercer than under previous periods of minority government.\n\nSo if Mr Swinney does get his speedy coronation, or whether he has to spend three weeks in tedious debates with an unknown activist, he knows his main job is running a competent government.

delay rebuild, says Swinney", "body": "John Swinney has argued a divisive SNP leadership contest could delay the party's essential \"rebuild\" amid reports a veteran activist could enter the race to replace Humza Yousaf.\n\nThe former deputy first minister could become SNP leader from Monday afternoon if he runs unopposed, with Mr Swinney stating he would like to get on with that job \"as quickly as possible\".\n\nHowever, reports suggest a leadership battle may be on the cards after activist Graeme McCormick used the independence march in Glasgow to drum up support for his candidacy.\n\nIt is understood Mr McCormick believes he is very likely to receive the 100 nominations from at least 20 SNP branches before the Monday deadline.\n\nMr McCormick has previously been critical of the SNP-led Scottish Government, using last year's party conference to criticise its independence strategy.\n\nIf he won the leadership race against Mr Swinney, he would not be able to become first minister as he is not elected in the Scottish Parliament, with Mr McCormick reportedly telling members he believes the roles should be run by two different individuals.\n\nBut, Mr Swinney, who at this point remains the only confirmed candidate, told the Sky News programme Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips he felt an internal contest would hamper the SNP's ability to recover from its turbulent period quickly.\n\nHe said: \"I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we have had, under my leadership, and bluntly, I'd just like to get on with that as quickly as I possible can do, because every day that we spend in an internal contest, which I think we all probably know the outcome of, we delay the possibility for the SNP to start its rebuilding.\"\n\nMr Swinney told the programme his leadership bid had received \"very, very comprehensive support\", including from former finance secretary Kate Forbes, who earlier ruled herself out of the contest.\n\nShould Mr McCormick receive the required nominations, a three-week leadership contest will be triggered, with ballots opening on Monday May 13 and closing on May 27.\n\nBut if Mr Swinney runs unopposed, he will be the next SNP leader and he will likely become first minister as early as next week after a Holyrood vote.\n\nMr Swinney, who previously led his party from 2000 to 2004, faced a leadership challenge from an activist in 2003 but ultimately won the contest with 83.9% of the vote.\n\nSpeaking later on BBC Scotland's the Sunday Show, he said he would respect the \"democratic process\" if there was a contest but added: \"I think it would be better if we just got on with things, that we started the rebuilding of the SNP and its political strength.\"\n\nHe added he thought the \"overwhelming majority\" of party members \"wanted to get on with it\".\n\nAsked where the party \"disunity\" came from, he cited the difficult leadership contest in 2023, which saw Mr Yousaf, Ms Forbes and Ash Regan, condemn each other's records and social views.\n\n\"I think we have basically just had a rough couple of years,\" he added.", "source": {"uri":

He is, like Humza Yousaf, a continuity candidate and, having been closely associated with what many regard as Nicola Sturgeon's culture wars agenda, will doubtless persist in pandering to the Greens' far-left agenda to ensure an SNP Holyrood majority.

The Noughties are 'retro' and anything from that period -- Nokia mobiles, iPods, the Xbox -- are considered 'vintage'.\n\nI am placing inverted commas around these terms as a self-defence mechanism. To my ageing mind, the early 2000s were just a few years ago, and they didn't make the best first impression.\n\nThe Noughties were the era of Big Brother, 9/11, dodgy dossiers, Simon Cowell, happy slapping, the Cheeky Girls and, worst of all, someone let Tony Parsons become a novelist.\n\nIt was the worst of times; it was the absolute worst of times.\n\nJohn Swinney says he wants to govern from 'the moderate centre-Left'\n\nIt was the time, and a very unhappy one at that, of John Swinney's first foray into the leadership of the SNP.\n\nSwinney succeeded Alex Salmond in the top job in 2000 and spent the next four years trying and failing to impose discipline on his party.\n\nDepending on who you ask, the hierarchy under Swinney were autocratic control freaks, or the rebels were wreckers and malcontents more interested in factionalism than attaining power.\n\nWherever the truth lies, everyone agrees Swinney was damaged by the loss of eight seats in the 2003 Holyrood election and a failure to gain ground in the following year's European Parliament poll.\n\nCalls to quit grew and he eventually realised the jig was up.\n\nNow he's back and, with Kate Forbes deciding not to contest the leadership this time, looks unlikely to face a serious challenger for the crown.\n\nAfter the calamitous conclusion to Humza Yousaf's ill-starred tenure, it's understandable that SNP members would gravitate to Swinney.\n\nThe party's entry into government in 2007 saw him take up a series of senior Cabinet roles, including deputy first minister, finance secretary and education secretary.\n\nFor 16 of the 17 years the SNP has been in power, Swinney has been around the Cabinet table.\n\nHis achievements are limited. A limp economy during his time at finance, collapsing school performances when he was in charge at education.\n\nBut his appeal to rank-and-file Nationalists is that he weathered one row after another in those portfolios.\n\nThat he did so with bluster and parliamentary invective is irrelevant.\n\nSNP members know they're not electing a man who will turn around the government's fortunes.\n\nThey're putting in a canny bruiser who knows how to handle himself. After the abrupt departures of first Nicola Sturgeon and now Humza Yousaf, the SNP is starting to resemble the UK Tory party with its conveyor belt of hapless leaders.\n\nMembers want stability and they see it in Swinney.\n\nAre they right? Or do they risk repeating their earlier mistake by electing a more experienced Humza Yousaf?\n\nIt is true Swinney is more cautious than the man he is expected to succeed.\n\nHe would not have ended the Bute House Agreement in the peremptory fashion that Yousaf did.\n\nNor would he have allowed his government to drift quite as far to the Left, to the point where it became difficult to distinguish SNP ministers from Green ones.\n\nSwinney is a man of the centre Left, but with more emphasis on the adjective than the noun.\n\nGiven his bitter experience, it is unlikely he would have allowed relations with the backbenches to deteriorate as they did under Yousaf.\n\nBut a less impulsive leadership style aside, it is not at all clear what Swinney brings to the job.\n\nThe parliamentary arithmetic remains the same. The SNP is shy of a majority and will have to convince opposition members if it wants to pass its legislation.\n\nYet with a UK election in the offing and a Holyrood vote only two years away, there will be ever less incentive for the opposition to back SNP budgets and other key bills.\n\nThis may leave Swinney with no choice but to rely on the Greens, and their price is clear.\n\nThey aren't going to vote for a budget that includes funding for fully upgrading the A96.\n\nThey're going to be pushing the government to press ahead with legislation such as a ban on conversion practices, including parents trying to stop their children changing genders.\n\nSwinney says he wants to govern from 'the moderate centre-Left' but as long as he must depend on Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, his government risks being dragged further leftwards.\n\nUnfortunately for Swinney, it won't be as easy as giving the Greens whatever they want in exchange for his political survival.\n\nThere is a faction of SNP backbenchers who are pro-development and sceptical of radical social policy.\n\nThey spent almost three years longing to get out of the Bute House Agreement and they will not take kindly to it returning as a Bute House Special Handshake.\n\nWith the Greens finally gone, these Nationalists want to keep them gone. And the loss of the government's majority will have emboldened them.\n\nFergus Ewing, Hammer of the Lentil Brigade, has already demanded progress on the A96. The next First Minister cannot take Ewing or any like-minded MSP for granted now.\n\nThen there is the phalanx of progressive Nationalists. They are fully signed up to the radical social agenda and may make their displeasure known if there is any attempt to back away from it\n\nThese are the characters who were preparing to block Kate Forbes at any cost.\n\nThe cost, it turns out, was going back to Swinney.\n\nNow he has to balance all these competing interests, and if there's one thing we know about him, it's that his first shot at leadership was hobbled by his inability to do just that.\n\nWhile juggling all this, he will have to run a government creaking under the pressure of 17 years of policy failure and deteriorating services -- and a voting public that is finally starting to blame the SNP.\n\nIt is a matter of months until that public goes to the polls in what looks set to be the SNP's most bruising encounter with the electorate in some considerable time.\n\nIt could be that Swinney is able to stabilise the party enough to halt further decline but it is not apparent that he has the political charisma to draw back voters already minded to vote Labour.\n\nThe self-created image of Honest John, the boring bank manager, might reassure nervous SNP parliamentarians but Retro John, the blast from the past, is unlikely to excite voters.\n\nNo one looks back fondly on Swinney's first leadership and there is little cause to look forward to his second go.\n\nAlready there are senior Nationalists briefing about plans to replace him with Westminster leader Stephen Flynn after the general election.\n\nNo wonder, when the latest poll has the SNP plummeting to just 15 seats at Westminster and losing the Holyrood election to Labour.\n\nJohn Swinney's second term as SNP leader hasn't even begun and already he's losing two elections and his colleagues are talking about ditching him.\n\nThere are less auspicious circumstances under which to take the helm of a political party, but not many.\n\nSwinney insists he won't be a caretaker and is in it for the long haul. It might not be up to him.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf",

Not only did the attainment gap widen on his watch, he was also responsible for the Covid exam scandal in which the SQA attempted to downgrade the exam results of pupils in the most deprived communities.\n\nAnd of course, he was the Finance Secretary responsible for destroying public finances and laying the groundwork for the current budget blackhole.\n\nFor all the cries that the SNP make of wanting to make Scotland Tory free, the fact is that every budget John Swinney passed from 2007 to 2011 was with Tory support.\n\nThanks to John Swinney, the SNP and the Tories cut local services and centralised power for four years.\n\nLet's be clear - John Swinney has been brought in to try and manage his chaotic and divided party - not to focus on running our country.\n\nThe return of John Swinney is the result of the SNP putting their own party's survival before the national interest.\n\nParty before country, spin before facts - this is all the SNP has to offer.\n\nFor all his claim that he is not a caretaker leader, this is just the start of the longest SNP leadership contest in history.\n\nDon't take my word for it - climate secretary Mairi McAllan said Swinney is the right man 'for the moment.'\n\nBoth John Swinney and the entire SNP's record is mired in chaos and failure - so it's no wonder they are running scared from an election.\n\nIt's hard to escape a sense of de ja vu watching a deeply chaotic and hopelessly divided government impose its second unelected leader in a row on our country.\n\nIn 2022 the Tories reduced the office of Prime Minister to a game of musical chairs, giving us Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak in under a year.\n\nThe SNP were rightly scathing of this farce at the time, with then-leader Nicola Sturgeon describing it as \"preposterous, democratically\".\n\nAnd yet here we are, watching the SNP lift directly from the Tory playbook and install a revolving door at Bute House.\n\nHumza Yousaf was in the job for just over a year when he took a wrecking ball to his own government - but this is not just about one man's incompetence.\n\nThe chaos engulfing this SNP government has been 17 years in the making.\n\nFor 17 years, the SNP has mismanaged lifeline services and squandered Scotland's potential.\n\nEvery single institution in our country has been left weaker by this government.\n\nThere are over 800,000 people stuck on NHS waiting lists and almost 10,000 children living in temporary accommodation.\n\nIn schools, violence is rising and standards are falling, while police officer numbers are being cut and crimes are being given a free pass.\n\nOur economy is flatlining and millions of pounds are being wasted on failed projects.\n\nThis is a party that has lost its way and a government that has lost touch, and swapping around the person at the top for the second time in 14 months won't fix that.\n\nThat is particularly true when the SNP's answer to their current woes is also the architect of them.\n\nWhile the SNP is once again putting its own party interests ahead of Scotland's national interest, Scottish Labour is ready to deliver the change our country needs.\n\nIt used to be the SNP who relished elections while Scottish Labour feared them - but now the opposite is true.\n\nScottish Labour has a plan to rebuild our struggling NHS, revive our flatlining economy and put optimism and hope back in Scottish politics.\n\nAcross the UK, we are ready to boot out this disastrous Tory government and improve lives here in Scotland by making work pay and cutting energy bills.\n\nIt's time for change - and the sooner Scottish voters get a say the better.\n\nBring on a U.K. and a Scottish election.\n\nTo sign up to the Daily Record Politics newsletter, clickhere", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anas_sarwar@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Anas Sarwar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deputy First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00e0iri_McAllan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e0iri McAllan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Conservative_Party_leadership_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2019 Conservative Party leadership election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Labour", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Truss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liz Truss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Salmond_government", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Salmond government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bute_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bute House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Record_(Scotland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Record (Scotland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boris Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Lineage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Lineage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Recycling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Highland_Games", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Highland Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32418282.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS324574352.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

contest stops opposition from gloating", "body": "John Swinney at Glasgow University giving his acceptance speech as leader of the SNP (Image: PA)\n\nJohn Swinney has become leader of the SNP and is set to become the next first minister after nominations closed at noon today and he was the only candidate.\n\nThe other names mentioned as possible candidates, former finance secretary Kate Forbes and party stalwart Graeme McCormick, both dropped out of the race after meeting with the former deputy first minister.\n\nThey both announced they had productive meetings with him and were withdrawing their candidacies and giving Swinney their full support.\n\nThere was a widespread feeling within the party that following weeks of upset and trauma, the very last thing the party needed right now was the expense and uncertainty of a three-weeklong leadership contest.\n\nREAD MORE: What happens next for SNP leader John Swinney?\n\nIt would have given Scotland's anti-independence media no shortage of negative SNP on SNP sound bites to headline and publicise, a prospect which was being eagerly anticipated on social media by anti-independence politicians.\n\nOver the weekend, BBC Scotland had been excitedly talking up the possibility of a leadership contest, and when it became clear that there wasn't going to be one you could hear the wails of disappointment from Pacific Quay.\n\nYou could hear them all the way over in the offices of Labour's Scottish accounting unit in John Smith House in West Regent Street, where they'd be drowned out by the wails of disappointment originating from within the building.\n\nAfter he was confirmed as the new leader of the SNP, Swinney wrote on social media that he was \"honoured to have been elected\".\n\nJohn Swinney gave his acceptance speech at Glasgow University\n\nHe could become first minister as early as tomorrow after out-going first minister Humza Yousaf holds his final Scottish Government cabinet meeting and officially tenders his resignation to King Charles.\n\nMSPs will then be given the opportunity to vote on the new first minister and if the Scottish Greens vote alongside the SNP the result is a foregone conclusion.\n\nHowever, the debate will of course provide Anas Sarwar and Douglas Ross the opportunity for grandstanding and for demanding the immediate elections that neither called for when Mark Drakeford, the first minister of Wales, stood down or at any point during the revolving door leadership changes in the Tory party.\n\nIt is not absolutely certain that the Scottish Greens will vote with the SNP or abstain.\n\nHowever, they have signalled their openness to discussions with Green co-convenor Patrick Harvie, saying in a statement: \"Scottish Green MSPs will meet to discuss our approach to the votes taking place this week.\n\nREAD MORE: John Swinney: SNP must work ' very hard' to win back independence supporters\n\nWe are committed to delivering on our vision of a fairer, greener, and more equal Scotland, and are open to talks with John Swinney and his team about how we can work together to make that happen.\"\n\nFollowing his successful election by MSPs, the new first minister will then have to swear three oaths of office at the Court of Session in Edinburgh before officially taking office.\n\nFor his part Scottish Tory leader, who got his own job as a consequence of an internal party putsch which unseated the previous leader Jackson Carlaw who had been democratically elected by the Scottish Tories' dwindling and elderly membership, passive-aggressively congratulated Swinney on becoming SNP leader \"for a second time\".\n\nCarlaw then immediately demanded that he abandon \"his relentless push for independence.\" Then without a scintilla of self-awareness, he criticised the SNP for engineering a \"stitch-up\" to \"ensure Swinney's coronation.\"\n\nScottish Tory leader Douglas Ross at FMQ's\n\nHave a wee look in the mirror Ross son, is that not the ghost of Carlaw looming over your shoulder?\n\nIn other news, it looks as though a leadership challenge to Rishi Sunak will not come to pass despite his party's dire showing in last week's local and mayoral elections in England as well as a Westminster by-election in Blackpool South - the results have been described as the party's worst performance in 40 years.\n\nThe Tories have belatedly realised that a change of leader won't do anything to improve their dismal electoral prospects and potential leadership hopefuls are going to sit back and let Rishi Sunak be the fall guy for deep-rooted Tory problems which, to be fair, are not entirely of his own making - although he certainly bears a not inconsiderable share of the blame.\n\nPlenty of influential voices in the party want the Tories to pivot even further to the right because apparently the party's real problem is that it's not nasty enough and is not completely unmoored from reality.\n\nThe fact that one of those influential voices is Liz Truss tells you all you need to know about how deranged the modern Conservative party has become.\n\nIf Truss was a doctor she'd have been struck off, but the Tories still think that there is value in her patient slaughtering snake oil.\n\nIn the aftermath of the election results, Suella Braverman, another cruel and incompetent right-wing Tory with her eye on the leadership who would never rise above the back benches in any party which still maintained a tenuous grasp on self-awareness, took to the BBC to insist that a change of leadership would not turn her party's fortunes around, and demanded that Sunak must own the Conservatives' failures.\n\nSunak's grasp on the leadership is really - and paradoxically - being protected by just how dreadful things are for the Tories right now.\n\nThere are plenty of vultures circling, not the least of which is Braverman, but none of them want to make a move until after Sunak carries the can for the inevitable drubbing that the Tories are set to take at the Westminster general election expected later this year.\n\nSunak will stagger on for the time being, unloved by his own party, but safe in his job for the sole reason that no one else wants it.", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

seats with Labour set to overtake in Scotland: poll", "body": "The SNP will retain just 15 of its current 43 seats at the forthcoming general election, according to a new poll for the Sunday Times.\n\nThe forecast comes as Humza Yousaf announced his resignation as First Minister on Monday after he abruptly ended the Bute House Agreement with the Scottish Green Party.\n\nThe Sunday Times poll, by Norstat - formerly known as Panelbase, is one of the first of its kind since Mr Yousaf announced his resignation, and looked at voting intentions for both Westminster and Holyrood.\n\nIt found that while support for independence remains largely unchanged, Labour is set to overtake the SNP at both Westminster and Holyrood, bringing an end to the SNP's streak of four consecutive election victories.\n\nThe survey comes as John Swinney is now expected to become first minister on Tuesday, provided no other challengers enter the race.\n\nWhen asked who would make the best first minister from a list of SNP candidates, Mr Swinney and Kate Forbes were neck and neck with the public on 23%, although Ms Forbes has said she will not be standing.\n\nStephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, was backed by 7%, and Jenny Gilruth, the Scottish education secretary, scored just 2%.\n\nThe SNP vote share in a Westminster election would fall to its lowest level since the 2014 independence referendum, the poll says.\n\nThe party would hold just 15 of its 43 seats with Scottish Labour winning 28 - a dramatic increase from its current two.\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times poll, the SNP would attract votes from 29% of the electorate - a fall of three points in a month, while Labour's share increased by two points to 34%.\n\nThis would return 15 SNP MPs and amount to a significant reversal in electoral performance.\n\nUnder Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP became the third largest party at Westminster, winning 56 of 59 Scottish seats in 2015.\n\nThere are currently 43 SNP MPs at Westminster.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives, whose vote share remained at 16% in the poll, would add three seats to return nine MPs - while the Liberal Democrats, on 8%, would boost their yield by one to five MPs.\n\nSupport for independence remains evenly balanced, with 48% in favour of Scotland leaving the UK and 52% backing the Union.\n\nVoting intentions at Holyrood show the SNP remains a point ahead of Labour in the constituency vote at 34%.\n\nThe Conservatives would pick up 14% of the vote, the Lib Dems 9% and the Greens 5% - with the remaining 5% to other parties.\n\nBut Scottish Labour has edged a point ahead of the SNP on the more proportional regional list vote with the nationalists' return of 27%.\n\nThe Tories would win 17% of regional votes, the Greens 9%, Lib Dems 8%, Reform UK 6% and Alex Salmond's Alba Party 4%.\n\nAn analysis by polling expert Sir John Curtice for the Sunday Times found that this result would leave Labour as the largest party at Holyrood with 40 seats.\n\nThe remainder of the chamber would be 38 for the SNP, 24 Conservatives, 10 Greens, nine Lib Dems and eight Reform parliamentarians.\n\nThis would mark a historic breakthrough for Nigel Farage's party in Scotland as it at least partially replicates its gains in England by attracting some older, Brexit-supporting Tories north of the border.\n\nSir John, professor of politics at Strathclyde University - who compiled the seat projections, said the \"question that now arises is whether the coronation of John Swinney will enable the SNP to turn the page\".\n\nHe added: \"Even among those who said they would vote Yes in another independence referendum, only 56% said they were now willing to back the SNP for Westminster, as would only two-thirds who voted for the party in 2019.\"\n\nNorstat interviewed 1,086 people aged 16 or over in Scotland between April 30 and May 3.\n\nSNP depute leader Keith Brown commented: \"After 14 years of cruel Tory governments inflicting endless damage on Scotland and Keir Starmer's Labour offering no meaningful alternative, it's clear only the SNP and independence offers a better future for our country.\n\n\"The SNP is the only party standing up for the priorities of people across Scotland and offering a positive vision for the future where decisions about Scotland are made in Scotland.\n\n\"At the general election Scottish voters have the chance to reject the cosy status quo of a broken Westminster system that is failing them and vote to elect SNP MPs who will always stand up for their interests\".", "source": {"uri":

With the Greens refusing to back him, Yousaf decided to step down before facing a vote of no confidence.\n\nThe Greens have said the government would need to continue pursuing progressive policies to secure their support.\n\nSwinney has pledged to follow a \"moderate, left of centre\" policy agenda that he hopes to effect by working with others in parliament through \"respectful dialogue\".\n\nTo pass legislation, including all-important budgets, as a minority government will require careful negotiation with opposition parties, a task he believes he can achieve given his long experience as a former finance secretary.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Labour", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centre-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252Fd25147c1-6f97-4113-999c-5366546caf6b.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900&overlay=https://www.ft.com/__assets/creatives/x/ft-overlay.png&overlay_height=0.15&overlay_y=30&overlay_gravity=south_east", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

This has to change,\" he said in his speech on Thursday morning.\n\nSNP MSP Kate Forbes pictured during her party's leadership contest last year. Photo Colin Mearns.\n\n\"Just as we must fight against the polarisation of our politics, we cannot allow the SNP to be polarised.\"\n\nHe heaped praise on former finance secretary Kate Forbes saying if he became First Minister she would have a \"significant role\" in government.\n\n\"We have many talented people leading the work of the Scottish Government. I want Kate Forbes to play a significant part in that team. She is an intelligent, creative and thoughtful person, who has much to contribute to our national life. And if I am elected, I will make sure that Kate is able to make that contribution,\" he said.\n\nMr Swinney declined to say if Ms Forbes would be given the role of his deputy when questioned by reporters after his speech.\n\nThat is certainly the expectation among some. However, it would mean a demotion for Shona Robison, who was Humza Yousaf's deputy and also finance secretary in Mr Yousaf's government.\n\nIt will also be interesting to see if Mr Swinney makes any other changes to his top team. For instance, will Neil Gray, Jenny Gilruth and Mairi McAllan remain in their respective roles as health, education and net zero secretaries?\n\nAnd in terms of other ministerial appointments, will allies of Ms Forbes such as former business minister Ivan McKee and her former campaign manager Michelle Thomson, be handed roles in government in a further move to unify the party and heal divisions?\n\nMr Swinney also underlined in his speech that there would be a shift of focus of his administration onto growing the economy to fund and deliver public services and fight child poverty.\n\nHow will that ambition be reflected in the new cabinet and ministerial team? Will policy areas be reviewed perhaps to give more weight to the needs of business and economic growth?\n\nA further issue to watch out for will be whether there will be less government focus given to policies around transgender rights.\n\nThe policy was given a significant focus under both Nicola Sturgeon and Humza Yousaf but has been hugely difficult for the SNP in regards party unity.\n\nThe gender recognition reform bill - blocked in the end by the UK Government - saw a large revolt of SNP MSPs in 2022 over plans to make it easier for transgender people to legally change their gender through a process of self-declaration.\n\nIt was telling, that when asked by a reporter on Thursday to say whether a transgender woman was a woman, Mr Swinney was keen to moved the question on.\n\nHe responded: \"If our politics is defined purely and simply by these questions, I think we're not addressing the core issues and challenges that people face in our society. So, today, I am going to address the core challenges and priorities that face people in our society.\"\n\nDoes such a shift of direction onto bread and butter issues mean less of a focus on the debate over transgender rights?\n\nIf so, will prominent advocates of gender self-identification such as equalities minister Emma Roddick remain in her role or be moved to another portfolio or out of government altogether?\n\nAnd longer term, what will happen to plans to ban conversion therapy, a commitment to the Greens in the now defunct Bute House Agreement?\n\nShould Mr Swinney press ahead with such plans he is likely to meet opposition from some in his party. But if he does not, others in his party could be unhappy.\n\nOver the coming months, as a general election looms, and then a Holyrood election is held in 2026, the new First Minister will have to unite his party, keep it united, and drive the key legislation of his minority government - reforms he wants to see tackle the core issues of economic growth and social justice - through parliament.\n\nMr Swinney will require all his experience and political skills to steer a steady course.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"},

SNP would delay rebuild, says Swinney", "body": "John Swinney has argued a divisive SNP leadership contest could delay the party's essential \"rebuild\" amid reports a veteran activist could enter the race to replace Humza Yousaf.\n\nThe former deputy first minister could become SNP leader from Monday afternoon if he runs unopposed, with Mr Swinney stating he would like to get on with that job \"as quickly as possible\".\n\nHowever, reports suggest a leadership battle may be on the cards after activist Graeme McCormick used the independence march in Glasgow to drum up support for his candidacy.\n\nIt is understood Mr McCormick believes he is very likely to receive the 100 nominations from at least 20 SNP branches before the Monday deadline.\n\nMr McCormick has previously been critical of the SNP-led Scottish Government, using last year's party conference to criticise its independence strategy.\n\nIf he won the leadership race against Mr Swinney, he would not be able to become first minister as he is not elected in the Scottish Parliament, with Mr McCormick reportedly telling members he believes the roles should be run by two different individuals.\n\nBut, Mr Swinney, who at this point remains the only confirmed candidate, told the Sky News programme Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips he felt an internal contest would hamper the SNP's ability to recover from its turbulent period quickly.\n\nHe said: \"I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we have had, under my leadership, and bluntly, I'd just like to get on with that as quickly as I possible can do, because every day that we spend in an internal contest, which I think we all probably know the outcome of, we delay the possibility for the SNP to start its rebuilding.\"\n\nMr Swinney told the programme his leadership bid had received \"very, very comprehensive support\", including from former finance secretary Kate Forbes, who earlier ruled herself

It certainly won't be John Swinney", "body": "Ms Marr was effusive in backing Michael Matheson as an honest politician yet he tried to defraud Scotland of \u00a311,000 before blaming it upon his own family. He was found to have broken the ministerial code and we still await news of the sanctions to be applied.\n\nShe called Humza Yousaf a competent First Minister yet he had to resign after he admitted his own catastrophic failure.\n\nShe hails Kate Forbes' decision to stand aside. Really? It appears that Ms Forbes was taken behind closed doors and the old guard's intentions made very clear to her.\n\nNow she lauds John Swinney as the new leader of the SNP who will miraculously cure all the SNP's ills and woes. She seems to have forgotten the failure in court of his Named Persons Bill and the absolute slating it received from the judiciary who likened it to the act of a dictatorship. As Education Secretary he took us out of PISA and other standards because they confirmed his disastrous tenure. Just to cap it all, he is the next continuity candidate of the discredited Sturgeon era - although in his defence it shall be hard to find out his record in that era due to the number of records that were deleted or never recorded in the first place.\n\nAs a professional seaman, there is one thing that makes me react spontaneously to help someone in peril no matter the situation: that is hearing Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! That is what went through my mind when I listened to John Swinney as he announced his intention to run for the post of First Minister on May Day. There was added irony in The Herald reporting seven ferries out of action (\"CalMac chaos escalates further\", The Herald, May 1) that actually became nine when the Isle of Cumbrae sitting in for Loch Shira on the Cumbrae service broke down and was withdrawn and the Loch Dunvegan on the Colintraive service having to implement a reverse-on drive-off service due to problems with her forward ramp and no backup vessel being available. Mr Swinney tells us that transport will be a priority in his First Minister role, when will he give us a fully financed plan to replace our ageing ferry fleet and end the unworkable CMAL/CalMac arrangement?\n\nSo just who is going to save Scotland? It won't be Mr Swinney. Just like CalMac, the SNP has run out of lifeboats to launch and deck chairs to rearrange.\n\nWHILE I would prefer Kate Forbes to be Scotland's First Minister, the deliberations over the last few days about who would be more suitable have brought out quite a lot of vitriol towards both contenders.\n\nNone of us are the same people we were 20 years ago and while Professor Sir John Curtice may have been right to say that John Swinney \"wasn't really that good at it\" first time round as leader (\"Curtice says Swinney should make Flynn his running mate in SNP leadership contest\", The Herald, April 30), if people are judged forever on their unwise decisions they made 20 years ago it is a very sad state. It seems no one must ever be allowed to forget their past. This reflects a very unforgiving society, as is demonstrated by the hounding of people of influence who once made a foolish statement on social media when they were teenage and continue to be vilified for their immaturity.\n\nMr Swinney talked about respect on Radio Scotland and commented that First Minister's Questions had been anything but respectful. Hopefully he can encourage more respect and kindness across the parties if he does become First Minister next week.\n\nIrene Munro, Conon Bridge.\n\n* SURELY everyone knows why Kate Forbes decided not to stand for the position of leader of the SNP. Once again she has proved how astute she is by holding back at this time.\n\nMild-mannered John Swinney will lead the party to a humiliating defeat at the next election and will be forced to resign. Ms Forbes will then step into the breach to take control of the SNP for the next five years.\n\nAlan McGibbon, Paisley.\n\n* PASS the sick bag. I find all the recent drivel being spoken about what's best for the people, the country and so on a bit nauseating and disingenuous. We can all see through this charade and know perfectly well it is nothing to do with these lofty aims. It's about how can a politician maintain his/her/etc snout in the trough for as long as possible.\n\nBRIAN Wilson hasn't held back in his views (\"Swinney as FM? That would be a democratic outrage\", The Herald, May 2).\n\nI will leave to one side all that Mr Wilson has to say about John Swinney's record because it is not relevant to Mr Wilson's ultimate point, which is that \"the case for a Holyrood election is unanswerable\". However, the fact is that the UK and devolved Scotland are representative parliamentary democracies, not presidential systems.\n\nHowever much any of us might not like it there is nothing constitutionally, or even democratically, under the existing system wrong with Liz Truss and then Rishi Sunak succeeding Boris Johnson. The same applies to the succession of Nicola Sturgeon by Humza Yousaf and now Mr Swinney. Under our system, candidates for Prime Minister and First Minister are nominated by their party and appointed by a majority of elected representatives in parliament.\n\nWhere many might agree that Mr Wilson has a point lies rather in the politics of this rather than in the parliamentary system. Both Mr Sunak (definitely) and Mr Swinney (most likely), and their parties, will have their meeting with electoral accountability, which is as it should be. If there is any \"outrage\" it would be better directed at the political system itself, preferably with a proposed, and better, alternative arrangement.\n\nWe can now, perhaps, expect complaints about a \"coronation\" rather than a leadership contest. I suspect though, that in the event of a contest, those same people would be trying to make political capital from it with claims of a party riven by division and wasting time and energy that would be much better spent governing. But that's partisan politics for you.\n\nI am confident that Mr Wilson would not dream of contributing to your pages in such a vein.\n\nREAD MORE: Hard luck, unionists: SNP will be more united than ever\n\nREAD MORE: SNP's big problem is it won't accept the world has left it behind\n\nREAD MORE: Humza Yousaf was set up to fail by Nicola Sturgeon\n\nSo who controls Scottish Labour?\n\nI HAVE to say that I am shaking my head in disbelief. First we had Rachel Reeves demanding (yes, demanding) that all MSPs vote to try and bring down the Scottish Government. Now I have to ask: why does an Opposition MP in London believe that they are in a position to demand anything from democratically elected representatives of the voters in Scotland?\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, guess what happened next? There was a vote in Holyrood to give the Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) women the compensation they are entitled to. I would have expected Labour to support this and vote for it, but no, they abstained! Why? Instructions from London again?\n\nIt has to be one of two things. Either Labour in Scotland doesn't think that these women deserve the compensation they are entitled to or they have been told by Keir Starmer to abstain and obeyed. Which is it?\n\nI have to wonder, who does Labour in Scotland answer to? Is it the people of Scotland or their bosses in London?\n\nAS the conflict in Gaza continues and Western leaders refuse to restrain Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet from their savagery, I find my \"bleeding heart\" (which I thought had became cauterised and inured to the relentless suffering of the Palestinian people because it is just not possible to walk around with that level of grief), I am once again consumed with sadness and rage.\n\nA Palestinian surgeon, Adnan Al-Bursh, who trained at King's College London, has been tortured to death in an Israeli prison. Just weeks ago another surgeon had been shot in his own operating theatre after refusing to leave a patient lying open on the table, imprisoned for 45 days without medical care, had his right eye poked out with a rifle butt and then dumped near the Gaza border where he had to crawl for two hours before seeking help. Why are the medical professional bodies not speaking out in solidarity with the hundreds of their colleagues being treated like this?\n\nBritish politicians with the honourable exception of the departing First Minister have abjectly and cravenly colluded in this utterly monstrous evil. But a spark of hope, not seen since the days of my childhood during Vietnam and the civil rights movement, has lit up the world. The students protesting are the conscience of the world. Confronting police brutality, hired thugs beating them with baseball bats and the threat to graduating or future employment have not deterred them. They are heroic, and whether the UK media reports it fairly or not we know the truth and we know that history is on the side of those challenging the moral cowardice of the US Congress and the disgraceful collusion of the Westminster Parliament.\n\nLAST December you published my letter lamenting Jon Rahm's decision to accept Saudi Arabian money and join the LIV tour and expressing concern that he was severely compromising his ability to win majors by playing 54-hole \"resort golf\" against inferior competition.\n\nIt gives me no pleasure to say \"told you so\" but his performance at the recent Masters was, to say the least, lacklustre, finishing a distant 45th and never in contention.\n\nGolf is a capricious game, and I would be the first to say that you can't judge a player on a single performance but he looked out of sorts and gave a number of frankly embarrassing interviews seeking to justify his decision and insisting he was ready for the fight.\n\nAs further observation: none of the LIV players really threatened the winner, Scottie Scheffler, and those who started well all fell away on the Sunday, perhaps because they had got too used to playing 54 holes and having the Sunday off.\n\nThe next major up for grabs is the PGA and I would be happy to eat humble pie if Rham or his LIV cohorts make a decent fist of it, but I have my doubts.\n\nIt seems difficult to choose between Mammon or majors, but Jon Rham will not be remembered for the amount of money he made in his career.\n\nKeith Swinley, Ayr.\n\nCould top golfer Jon Rahm be ruing his decision to join up with the LIV tour? (Image: PA)\n\nService fee\n\nBRIAN Watt's tale of being called a \"member\" of OVO energy (Letters, May 3) brings to mind the stewardship campaign of a church of which I was a member in the true sense of the word.\n\nOne elder adopted the tactic of telling the members of his district that, just like being members of a golf club, they were members of the Christ club, and that there was a

It now heads a minority government in Holyrood.\n\nThe slide has boosted the hopes of Britain's opposition Labour Party of regaining ground in Scotland, one of the United Kingdom's four nations, as it seeks to win a British parliamentary election expected later this year.\n\nThe SNP aims to reinvigorate the push for another referendum on independence from the United Kingdom.\n\nScots voted against splitting from the United Kingdom by 55% against 45% in a referendum in 2014, but the independence movement says Britain's later departure from the European Union changed the situation and another referendum is justified - a claim that both the ruling Conservative Party and Labour reject.\n\n(Reporting by Muvija M, Editing by Bernadette Baum and Angus MacSwan)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Party of England and Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Catalan_independence_referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2017 Catalan independence referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brexit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deputy First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/photos-for-speed-desk-29.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

A leadership contest would have exposed old wounds and given new life to those more recent ones which brought about the downfall of Humza Yousaf.\n\nJohn Swinney's first test as SNP leader will be to secure the backing of parliament in a vote to become First Minister. This is one he is expected to pass, with the support of the Greens.\n\nWhile some within the party will be frustrated that they didn't get a chance to vote on their next leader, many will be relived to see John Swinney at the helm.\n\nHe is a man with extensive experience in the highest levels of government and within the SNP itself. As a former leader of the SNP and a former Deputy First Minister, he will be uniquely placed to hit the ground running.\n\nThe party stalwart won't need an orientation session or a period to settle into his new role. As Nicola Sturgeon's former right-hand man, he already knows the ins and outs of the job. The last week has been a real-time demonstration of his political experience.\n\nHe was deft in his manoeuvres, managing to bring his biggest threat, former leadership challenger Kate Forbes, into the Swinney fold. At the launch of his leadership bid, he spoke a message of unity, promising to work collaboratively to bring the divided party back together again.\n\nHe pledged to give Kate Forbes a high-profile role in his cabinet and she offered him her support.\n\nHe also managed to stave off a move from the grassroots which would have forced a leadership election.\n\nGraeme McCormick had gathered enough signatures for a leadership nomination but decided not to continue with his bid after a ''lengthy and fruitful'' discussion with Swinney. The new SNP leader not only neutralised the threat, he managed to secure McCormick's support too.\n\nThe ability to persuade others is one of the core skills that a politician needs. Over the last decade, it has gone out of fashion.\n\nWe now judge our politicians not on their ability to convince others of their position, but on how vociferously they trash their opponents.\n\nJohn Swinney will need powers of persuasion\n\nAs the leader of a minority government, John Swinney will have to rely on his powers of persuasion to get legislation through. He will have to work in the very way that the Scottish Parliament was set up to encourage. In this, his political opponents may come to regret their success in forcing Humza Yousaf out of office.\n\nThere is no doubt that John Swinney has inherited a poisoned chalice. The problems that Humza Yousaf faced haven't miraculously vanished with him. John Swinney will now be responsible - and accountable for - the pressures on the NHS, falling living standards and the drugs death crisis, to name just a few.\n\nThere is also the small matter of achieving his party's stated aim of independence for Scotland.\n\nBut when it comes down to it, Douglas Ross and Anas Sarwar would much rather be squaring off against Humza Yousaf on those issues than John Swinney.\n\nWhere Humza Yousaf sometimes seemed overwhelmed by the scale of the challenges he inherited from Nicola Sturgeon, John Swinney has been around the block a few times.\n\nHe is much better placed to see beyond the bad headlines, rather than being consumed by them. His critics say he is too close to the old guard of the SNP and, in particular, Nicola Sturgeon, to be able to meaningfully implement real change. Time will tell on that front, but in the short term at least, his opponents might wonder whether it was the smartest move to switch out Humza Yousaf for somebody of John Swinney's experience and ability.\n\nAt the weekend, my boyfriend promised us a gentle walk up an easy hill.\n\nHowever, as we approached the bottom of Ben A'an to begin our stroll, I strongly suspected I had been hoodwinked.\n\nWe were accompanied on the walk by a duo of reluctant ramblers, in the form of my 10-year-old daughter and seven-month old-puppy. Neither seemed particularly enthused by the journey ahead.\n\nMy boyfriend was responsible for stopping the dog from jumping off the rocky terrain and I was responsible for cajoling my daughter up it.\n\nMotivational speeches were offered and eyerolls were given in return. The ascent to the summit was in parts more akin to rock climbing than walking.\n\nMany fellow walkers who saw my daughter and I struggling gave us words of encouragement. It must have been patently obvious that this was not our natural habitat.\n\nFinally, we reached the top and we enjoyed a brief picnic that was only occasionally interrupted by the puppy trying to make a deadly bid for freedom.\n\nA lovely time was eventually had by all, but I will be Googling all my boyfriend's walking route suggestions before agreeing to them in the future.", "source": {"uri": "thecourier.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Courier"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Conservative_Party_leadership_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2019 Conservative Party leadership election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deputy First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Party of England and Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Labour_Party_leadership_election_(UK)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2015 Labour Party leadership election (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Ross_(Scottish_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Ross (Scottish politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anas_Sarwar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anas Sarwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2024/05/7a6c3138-21d9-436f-a927-2da589321e2f-2abvkjbph.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Managing devolution is now incompatible with prosecuting independence. As a result, our support is waning.\"\n\nMcCormick added: \"The party must waste no time in debating and resolving this fundamental issue. The leadership contest is the ideal forum.\n\n\"I believe with all my heart and soul that the SNP can deliver a majority vote for an independent Scotland. The polls for Independence are consistently positive. The SNP has the opportunity to regain its lost support if it promises to dissolve the union through the Ballot Box. No other party can do so.\"\n\nIf McCormick secures enough nominations and puts his name forward before a deadline of noon tomorrow then a leadership contest will take place between May 13 - 27 and potentially derail Swinney's ascension as leader and First Minister.\n\nSwinney, meanwhile, argued a divisive SNP leadership contest could delay the party's essential \"rebuild\".\n\nHe told the Sky News programme Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips: \"I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we have had, under my leadership, and bluntly, I'd just like to get on with that as quickly as I possible can do, because every day that we spend in an internal contest, which I think we all probably know the outcome of, we delay the possibility for the SNP to start its rebuilding.\"\n\nSwinney also said his leadership bid had received \"very, very comprehensive support\", including from former finance secretary Kate Forbes, who earlier ruled herself out of the contest.\n\nIf McCormick won the leadership race against Swinney, the activist would not be able to become First Minister as he is not elected in the Scottish Parliament, with the activist reportedly telling members he believes the roles should be run by two different individuals.\n\nMcCormick has been contacted for comment and more details.", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot",

It's easy and will only take a moment.\n\nA day is a long time in politics. How often have we heard that quip over recent times? If my prematurely greying hair is anything to go by, too often.\n\nI recall what it was like working in the UK Parliament during those rapidly changing Brexit votes in 2019; long days, moving goalposts, and uncertainty for the country. We were told then by many a nationalist that political conduct at Holyrood is different, how badly that has aged.\n\nThe SNP's Maree Todd will feel that. Just hours before Humza Yousaf unceremoniously booted the Scottish Greens from government she was still defending their coalition. A lesson in what happens when your job is to repeat central party lines, not shape them.\n\nJohn Swinney offers Kate Forbes a top government job in bid to become First Minister\n\nKate Forbes will NOT run to be First Minister, instead she backs John Swinney\n\nWhat could John Swinney and Kate Forbes working together mean for the Highlands?\n\nBut on a serious note, all the oxygen in the room is being taken up by the political turmoil in the SNP. People have had enough and want their politicians to focus on the job at hand. That is certainly the feeling I have had shared with me on the doors.\n\nFor too many, access to GPs and dental care is next to impossible. For too many, the opportunity to buy an affordable home in their community is all but gone. For too many, their local school that was once the pride of the community is now left crumbling down.\n\nWe desperately need a government focused on these priorities.\n\nSome may suggest that a new First Minister will do that. That it will be the long awaited day that the government in Edinburgh fixes its broken relationship with rural Scotland. For the interests of our communities, I genuinely wish I shared that hope.\n\nBut a change in SNP leader will do nothing more than put icing on a burnt cake. With 17 years in government, too many in the SNP have for too long chosen to toe the party line and leave rural voices to feel ignored.\n\nThe Highlands has endured - and Liberal Democrats have fought against - the hollowing out of community policing with the centralisation of the police force, the ill judged attempt to impose Highly Protected Marine Areas, endless delays with the dualling of the A9 and now plans to seize control of care services.\n\nThis catalogue of decisions, that run against the interest of our local communities, only points to a centralising diktat in the SNP that runs deeper than one person. I fear this leopard simply cannot change its spots.\n\nThat fear is only reinforced by the SNP's anointed continuity candidate, John Swinney. He is SNP establishment with a history of threatening councils, ring fencing funding and centralising power. He stood shoulder to shoulder with Salmond, Sturgeon and Yousaf and he cannot hide from their shared failures. Is this Back to the Future? It's certainly not a break from the past.\n\nThe Highlands cannot afford more chaos and more of the same.\n\nPeople deserve a real alternative. They deserve their say. We need a change of direction and, across the Highlands, it is the Liberal Democrats that offer it.\n\nDavid Green\n\nScottish Liberal Democrat candidate for Caithness, Sutherland and Ross.", "source": {"uri": "northern-times.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Northern Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maree_Todd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maree Todd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brexit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Highlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Highlands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General practitioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Democrats (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caithness,_Sutherland_and_Ross_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caithness, Sutherland and Ross (Scottish Parliament constituency)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Liberal_Democrats", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Liberal Democrats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Salmond", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Salmond"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.northern-times.co.uk/_media/img/BDB2PAB72HV7ZSZS4MYM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

By all opinion polls and recent by-election results, the SNP vote is hovering around the 30% range. In the time we have left it will be very difficult, if not impossible, for any first minister to turn the ship around and avoid the loss of a potentially large number of SNP seats. In the past few years some SNP policies and performance have not been attractive to the average voter.\n\nREAD MORE: John Swinney: Leadership challenge from SNP activist will 'delay' rebuild\n\nThe real challenge starts the day after the Westminster elections. May 2026 will by that time probably be only 18 short months away. A week is, as the saying goes, a long time in politics. With a good campaign, who knows what the overall result will be?\n\nIt could well be argued that the current lack of a large independence majority in the Scottish Parliament is a direct result of the policy of voting SNP on both ballot papers in May 2021. As a result, more than a million SNP votes on the regional lists ended up being wasted.\n\nA question which must be asked and answered fairly soon is - are we going to repeat the same mistake? Perhaps it is time for personality to be put aside in favour of practicality and for hearts and minds to come together to find a way to maximise the independence vote in May 2026.\n\nI hesitate to quote Winston Churchill, but \"those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\"\n\nBrian Lawson\n\nPaisley\n\nWITH the General Election at some stage in the future I am left with several questions.\n\nAre the people of Scotland going to change back to pre-1997 voting trends, when the Labour Party ruled the Scottish roost, with Tony Blair and Gordie Broon, who both created and saved us from the financial collapse in 2007?\n\nREAD MORE: Patrick Harvie speaks out after end of Bute House Agreement\n\nOr will the time machine carts us all back further back to 1955 when the Conservatives owned Scottish voters' hearts and minds?\n\nNo! The genie is out of the bottle and, despite the misinformation in some media sources, Scots can see the good and admittedly the bad in our Scottish Government.\n\nThe bad is brought up at every opportunity by most media sources, as we all know that bad news sells. The bad could be reduced but not eliminated by the Scottish Government having the full levers of power, a higher focus on making stuff work better, and not being required to back-fill gaps in the social policy of UK Government. I am not sure if the media noise would reduce much.\n\nThe good could be even better when full fiscal autonomy is achieved, with increased support for the early and later years. I am thinking about care workers and the like, social care in the community, increased dentistry and GP practices.\n\nHowever, on the horizon is a UK General Election which is a fight between Labour and Tory, where the difference is not worth arguing about.\n\nThe Labour Party under Starmer are wedded to sticking to the fiscal austerity that Tories in Westminster have been dishing out like the Dickensian medicine of \"brimstone and treacle\" since 2010, or 14 years.\n\nNo wonder we need them out, but Labour, no change then?\n\nAlistair Ballantyne\n\nAngus\n\nONCE again a week is a long time in politics, especially Scottish politics this week. Over the last week we have seen the fall of the coalition agreement at Holyrood, the resignation of the SNP party leader and First Minister Humza Yousaf, and now we have one candidate forward to be SNP leader and possibly Scotland's new first minister.\n\nIn this candidate, John Swinney MSP, you have experience and commitment, because Mr Swinney has held the second most senior post in government, deputy first minister, along with a number of top-ranked ministerial posts. And it was during Mr Swinney's service in the Cabinet for a number of years that the SNP secured four election victories at Holyrood.\n\nGoing forward, should Mr Swinney secure the position of first minister his experience and service to the Scottish political scene over many years will surely be called upon.\n\nCatriona C Clark\n\nFalkirk\n\nHAVING watched Thursday's FMQs, I cringed as I had to listened to Douglas Ross bumping his gums about how he had single-handedly had removed the FM from post to the rapturous cries and desk-banging from the Tory rabble.\n\nHaving now heard the various SNP announcements about a successor, surely even D Ross must now realise that he \"single handedly\" had managed to remove a FM who, although I had great respect for, was not always universally popular with what can only be described as \"The Dream Team\" so far as reviving SNP fortunes and future electoral success is concerned.\n\nNOW that chattering classes are turning their ire/fire on to John Swinney, we can no longer tell friend from foe. May I offer a word of advice to all backstabbers, saboteurs and agents provocateurs?\n\nWhen the hunting season starts in the US, it is safer to be a bear, as the rednecks are too busy shooting each

He should call one.", "body": "This article appears as part of the Unspun: Scottish Politics newsletter.\n\nBreathe deep. Can you smell the Scottish exceptionalism in the air? It's quite something.\n\nIt seems that unless the nation is subjected to the spectacle of another - this time last-minute - outbreak of factionalism within the SNP, John Swinney will receive his coronation as First Minister.\n\nThe SNP hate the word 'coronation', incidentally. For the nationalist base, it really gets under their skin.\n\nUnderstandably so. Every time the Tories dump a leader and crown a new one without seeking a fresh mandate from voters, the SNP screams for a general election. And they're quite right in their oft-repeated demands.\n\nYet, strangely, they never seem to fancy an election when it's they who are crowning their own Top Cat, as they've done for a second time in a row now that Swinney's moment has come.\n\nHere, for example, is Nicola Sturgeon in October 2022, back when she was First Minister herself, commenting on what should happen after the vertiginous fall of Liz Truss: \"Of course there should be general election.\n\n\"The governance of any country cannot simply be a revolving door that one party gets to pick time and time again who occupies the highest office in the land. It's preposterous, democratically.\"\n\nThe Tories, she said, \"can't keep changing who occupies Number 10 without getting democratic legitimacy... Do I think that is going to happen? That the Tories are voluntarily going to concede that? No.\"\n\nUnspun | Neil Mackay: Yousaf and the SNP deserve to fall, and Scotland deserves an election\n\nHmm. The then Westminster leader Ian Blackford also called for a general election, as did a certain John Swinney.\n\nAt the time, Conservative Party chairman Craig Hoy cravenly insisted the party should serve out its full five-year term.\n\nSwinney, then Sturgeon's deputy, called on the Conservatives to \"do the decent thing\". He added: \"We should have a general election and I don't think the Conservative Party should be allowed to play any more of their games... The people of this country must be given the chance to decide on the way we are governed moving forward.\"\n\nOne again: hmm. This is so confusing, isn't it? As the SNP insist there's absolutely no need for an election now Swinney is in the chair. The excuse - obviously - is that the Scottish Parliament votes in the First Minister, not the ruling party.\n\nYes, well, that's all very 'angels dancing on pinheads' really in terms of its merit as an argument. There's no question of Swinney not getting voted in by the parliament thanks to the numbers commanded by the SNP, the Greens and the lonely Alba representative. The smokescreen is rather thin, to be honest.\n\nUnspun | Neil Mackay: Yes movement is not prepared for crushing blow lying ahead\n\nYet surely there's more to this than just sticking to parliamentary bureaucracy? Isn't there such a thing called 'honour'? What's good for the goose is good for the gander, right? If the SNP wanted to they could trigger an election to give Swinney a valid mandate.\n\nUnder the Scotland Act, it just takes a two-thirds majority of MSPs to vote for an election and it happens. I'm sure the opposition parties would oblige in making up the numbers.\n\nNot that the opposition parties have anywhere to hide either. Labour in Wales just installed a new First Minister with no election, and as we know Rishi Sunak, like Liz Truss, took power with no recourse to the electorate.\n\nBoth Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss took the reins of power without a general election mandate\n\nAll these parties can, of course, hide behind parliamentary rules and structures to stop the people having a say when they change the heads of our governments, but it looks thoroughly dishonourable, cowardly, manipulative and hypocritical.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what the SNP's position should be in the very near future if the Tories turn on Sunak and inflict another new leader on Britain without an election.\n\nIt's entirely likely, after all. The knives are already being sharpened for the Prime Minister after the Tory Party's dismal performance in England's local elections and at the Blackpool by-election.\n\nOf course, the SNP would simply fall back on the line that its Holyrood which elects the First Minister, not the ruling party as in Westminster. But that's such a transparent fig leaf, it feels almost inappropriate.\n\nSwinney is now running an administration for which Sturgeon won a mandate. After she scarpered, we had Humza Yousaf. The deal with the Greens is done. Yet we are supposed to accept that nothing has changed substantively to demand a fresh mandate. It just doesn't wash. In truth, it's thoroughly anti-democratic.\n\nNobody is demanding perfection from politicians - just a little consistency and integrity. Trust in democracy is at rock bottom. If we want strong political systems we need to have politicians not just held to account, but willing - eager, in fact - to have their mandates tested and affirmed at every opportunity which demands it by the electorate.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

"Holyrood's longest-serving deputy first minister is now set to become first minister after being announced as the SNP's second new leader in the space of 13 months.\n\nSeveral high-profile figures in the party backed John Swinney as the best candidate for the post in the wake of Humza Yousaf's abrupt resignation as First Minister.\n\nThe parliamentarian thought to be his main challenger, Kate Forbes, announced she would not stand and backed his bid, as he said he hoped she would play a significant part in his team.\n\nMr Swinney, one of the original intake of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, is seen by many as being able to provide calm leadership at what is a time of political turmoil for Scotland's governing party.\n\nBut it is not be the first foray into the leadership for the former Tayside North MP.\n\nMr Swinney celebrates after being elected SNP leader in 2000 (PA)\n\nIn September 2000, he took over as leader following the first departure of Alex Salmond, having served as his deputy for two years previously.\n\nHis tenure was not a happy one.\n\nUnder his leadership, the SNP's fortunes slid, returning just five MPs at the 2001 Westminster election and 22 MSPs in the 2003 Holyrood vote.\n\nAfter seeing off an attempt to oust him by a party activist, Mr Swinney stepped down voluntarily after a poor showing at the 2004 European election.\n\nJohn Swinney as finance secretary with then first minister Alex Salmond in 2010 (PA)\n\nBut that was not the end of his political story as he was brought back by Mr Salmond to serve as finance secretary when the SNP took power in 2007.\n\nHe served in the role for the entirety of Mr Salmond's tenure, before being appointed deputy first minister by Nicola Sturgeon when she took over.\n\nOver the following nine years, the Perthshire North MSP occupied several ministerial offices in the Scottish Government, including as education secretary, Covid-19 recovery secretary and again in finance, taking over that brief from Ms Forbes while she was on maternity leave.\n\nNicola Sturgeon and John Swinney embrace after her final session of First Minister\u00b4s Questions in 2023 (Jane Barlow/PA)\n\nDuring his time as Ms Sturgeon's deputy, he cemented his reputation as a dogged defender of his boss, as well as an SNP stalwart.\n\nBut it was not without its challenges, as he faced two close no confidence votes in Holyrood, first over the handling of school exams during the pandemic, and his initial refusal to publish legal advice during the inquiry into the botched handling of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond.\n\nThe election of Mr Yousaf as first minister saw Mr Swinney call time on his career in the Scottish Cabinet, but he is now gearing up to take the helm.", "source": {"uri":

It could, however, turn out to be a pyrrhic victory. Mr Ross may have forced the bad guy out of town, but the SNP has rallied behind an old gunslinger who is promising to restore order.\n\nJohn Swinney has put unity at the core of his campaign for leadership of the SNP that, barring any late bids, will be confirmed on Monday. He has been described as the 'continuity continuity' candidate by opponents who say he represents a seamless transition from Nicola Sturgeon and Mr Yousaf. That may be so in so far as he clearly arrives at Bute House with lots of baggage from previous ministerial posts and being the architect of much that has gone wrong for the SNP during its 17 years in government.\n\nMr Swinney is re-packaging his record as \"experience\" that will serve him well in knowing not only where the bodies are buried, but what works and what doesn't. His first Cabinet will reveal who he believes will deliver and who won't. \"We need all the talents available to us,\" he declared in his leadership launch speech on Thursday. He want to end the divisiveness that has riven the party by drawing together all its expressions in parliament, councils and at grassroots.\n\nHe will need to move quickly. He says he intends to win back support in the general election and the 2026 Scottish Election and serve for a full term after that. As such he wants to establish a Swinney legacy. So what will that look like and, more to the point, what can we expect in the next week?\n\nWe will see the first stones laid in building the New SNP when Mr Swinney announces his first Cabinet. He has promised a significant role for Kate Forbes, who was likely to be his own rival for the top job. Reinstating her as Finance Secretary to replace Shona Robison may be too brutal even in a radical shake-up of posts. It might also signal disapproval of the Scottish Budget which Ms Robison delivered only in December. Ousting her would therefore cast doubt on its validity and open the party to more criticism.\n\nDon't be surprised, however, if Ms Forbes snatches Ms Robison's role as Deputy First Minister. Alternatively, she may be made minister without portfolio with responsibility for bringing about the cohesion in government policy-making that Mr Swinney spoke about. A third, and possibly additional role, could be providing maternity cover for Wellbeing Economy and Net Zero Secrertary Mairi McAllan.\n\nAs for policy, there is talk of promoting housing to a full Cabinet post. This would be a smart move, appeasing the many critics of government policy. In a stroke, Mr Swinney could see unity in action by satisfying the needs of tenants's rights groups, housebuilders and overseas investors.\n\nThose who witnessed the mauling that housing minster Paul McLennan received at last month's Scottish Property Federation conference were left in no doubt about the strength of feeling in the sector, though to be fair, much of their anger is really aimed at the Green party for its damaging rent controls and costly environmental measures.\n\nThat brings us to the future of the Greens. Despite their voting down Labour's opportunistic confidence vote in the government, there is little chance of a return to ministerial office for Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater who must live with the memory, not only of rent controls, but of the failed deposit return scheme and marine protection.\n\nThat said, Mr Swinney will run a minority administration and in a spirit of greater consensus and less hostility in the chamber, he wants to reach out to all parties in order that the government can function. In that respect, it will spread power rather than diminish it.\n\nAlready, however, his insistence on ploughing on with the independence campaign could prove his Achilles Heel, the issue that will divide rather than unite. He is the latest to claim that he will be the First Minister to deliver it. He has not said how. In fact, he has not said how in all his years in the parliament. He is the independence continuity minister. Or least the minister who will continue to over promise and under deliver on a plan that remains out of reach.", "source": {"uri": "magazine.dailybusinessgroup.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

John Swinney, formerly Nicola Sturgeon's deputy FM and onetime leader of the SNP himself, has been elected - unopposed - as the new leader of the Scottish National party. Thought to have been parachuted in by the party establishment, Swinney's coronation was almost foiled by 'flatulence in a trance' SNP activist Graeme McCormick who, by some quirk in the SNP's constitution, had enough nominations to stand against the MSP for the leadership. But, at the eleventh hour, the renegade backed down after having 'lengthy and fruitful' talks with Swinney himself.\n\nBranded the 'unity' candidate, the new SNP leader is thought to have made a pact with Kate Forbes, who was expected to run against him for the top job. Forbes announced she would not be standing on Thursday, endorsing Swinney instead as offering a vision of 'competent, candid government earning the trust of the people'. Mr S will believe it when he sees it...\n\nThe Scottish parliament is still to vote Swinney in as First Minister - but before it does, Mr S would be keen to take a look at some of the former leader's worst moments...\n\nCovid WhatsApps\n\nWhen Humza Yousaf became First Minister in 2023, he promised Scots that he would usher in a new era of 'openness and transparency'. Then followed three arrests in relation to SNP finances, an \u00a311,000 iPad scandal and, of course, a rather unedifying Covid inquiry that revealed Nats had been routinely deleting their WhatsApp messages - after slamming senior figures in the UK government for doing similar. Awkward...\n\nOne of the key SNP figures at the heart of the Covid WhatsApp scandal was, you guessed it, Swinney himself. Once it emerged that Sturgeon hadn't retained her pandemic messages, it wasn't long before her former deputy was outed for not holding onto his either. Swinney admitted he had been 'periodically' deleting his message exchanges, adding that to his mind, this approach had always been government policy. Since entering Holyrood in 2007, Swinney said that he'd 'deleted material after I had made sure any relevant information was placed on the official record of the government, and that was the approach I was advised to take'. Golly.\n\nHowever his former boss and then-first minister Alex Salmond was quick to rebuke the claims:\n\nHonest John, as John Swinney used to be called, said he was doing this manually and that he said he was doing it since 2007. As First Minister between 2007 and 2014 can I assure everyone that no such policy was in existence in these years and John was doing it off his own back.\n\nAn accolade that Mr S is rather sure Swinney won't be putting on his CV is his reputation as one of Scotland's worst education ministers. When he was education secretary between 2016 and 2021, Swinney's tenure was far from a smooth success. He faced two confidence votes, had to scrap plans for his own education bill and was responsible for the Scottish exam results scandal during the pandemic.\n\nSturgeon was adamant she was going to close Scotland's poverty-related education gap - but the former FM's right-hand man was of no great help, with the attainment gap even widening in some areas. Not content with the damage he'd already caused Scotland's schooling, Swinney narrowly faced off a confidence vote in 2020 - after it emerged his Covid scoring system (that graded pupils who were unable to take exams due to restrictions) led to children from poorer areas being penalised.\n\nAnd Swinney presided over Scotland's new 'Curriculum for Excellence' education strategy that, er, saw a remarkable nosedive in schooling standards and international league tables. As the Times Educational Supplement put it, 'it highlighted a disconnect between the ambitions of CfE and the qualifications in upper secondary, where the focus is on traditional exams'. Displaying a disconnect between fantasy and reality? Not the SNP, surely...\n\nNamed persons law\n\nThe Scottish government faced immense backlash after it tried to introduce a radical 'Named Person' law in 2016. Its objective was to have a 'named person' act as a point of contact between every child under 18 years old and the authorities. But the planned bill was criticised by judges for making 'perfectly possible' the chance that a young person's confidential information could be disclosed to authorities without the child or their parents knowing. Crikey.\n\nSlammed as a 'snooper's charter', the proposals were found to breach human rights laws - namely the right to privacy and a family life - by the Supreme Court. The bill was ditched in 2019 with the clumsy U-turn dubbed a 'complete humiliation'. Its architect? John Swinney.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Salmond", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Salmond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radical politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TES_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TES (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crikey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crikey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right to privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_for_Excellence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curriculum for Excellence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-492949660.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Over the weekend, there were also reports that party activist Graeme McCormick was hoping to challenge Swinney for the leadership, but Sky News reported late on Sunday that he had decided not to proceed with his nomination,\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Party of England and Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_05_2019_12_10_51_4304562.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

I can't think of an occasion where the coup was carried out by the hired help.\n\n\"The machinery of the SNP, which appears now to be the SNP, seems to be able to wake up one morning and say lets replace leader. To say that is bad for democracy is an understatement.\"\n\nA senior government source said: \"The question you need to ask is who is in control of the SNP if its not the leader of the party and the answer is Nicola Sturgeon, John Swinney, Angus Robertson, Ian Blackford, Liz Lloyd and a small but influential group bonded by their absolute antipathy towards Alex Salmond and determination to block him gaining any influence.\n\n\"Swinney has been talking about unity but the truth is that for personal reasons these people will never find common ground with the Salmond wing of the party which wants to drop gender based identity politics and the Green Party, and return to sharp focus on the economy, public services and independence.\"\n\n\"Yousaf had to go and Kate Forbes also had to be stopped because she would never have been able to work with the Greens and so would also have been likely to team up with Regan, of whom she is a friend.\n\n\"Swinney was seen as the only candidate to keep her out and take over the reigns for a couple of years, take the general election hit, and then let a proper leadership race take place further down the line.\n\nThursday April 25\n\nHumza Yousaf calls a 10am press conference confirming he had ended the Bute House Agreement with the Green party after a car crash interview where co-leader Harvie had refused to accept The Cass Report into gender reform.\n\nTwo hours earlier the Greens, summoned to the FM's offical residence, faced total humiliation when their former SNP colleagues cheered, applauded and thumped the table after the FM axed them.\n\nA source told the Sunday Mail: \"There was a decision before the full cabinet that the Bute House Agreement was to be terminated. \"Patrick and Lorna then went into the cabinet meeting where they were handed letters from Humza and the rest of the cabinet members in the SNP were thumping the table and cheering.\n\n\"These are people who were relying on our support less than 24 hours before. To then be cheered out of Bute House by the rest of the cabinet and marched straight in front of the press - is it any wonder they were so angry about what happened?\"\n\nLorna Slater calls it \"a spectacular breach of trust\".\n\nFriday April 26\n\nThe FM tells the Greens he understands their anger and urges them not to back a Tory vote of no confidence. He's back at home in Dundee and announces \u00a380million for affordable housing in Scotland. Scottish Labour table a vote of no confidence in his government.\n\nAlex Salmond's Alba party MSP Ash Regan writes to him and tells him: \"My door is open.\"\n\nA SNP source said that Humza realised that he'd made a fatal error and considering resigning but was talked out of it by pregnant wife Nadia. The friend said: \"At that point, he thought he could fight on.\"\n\nEx-FM Nicola Sturgeon is understood to to have approached the Greens to try and get them to change their minds but failed. Tentative plans were then discussed about replacing Humza with Swinney should Humza be forced out.\n\nSaturday April 27\n\nLetters\n\nYousaf writes to leaders of the other parties to meet with him in a bid to find \"common ground\" ahead of the vote of no confidence. He is dismissed by Scottish Labour's Anas Sarwar, the Tories Douglas Ross and the Lib Dem's Alex Cole Hamilton.\n\nHumza's team confirms to the Sunday Mail that lines of communication have been opened between him and Ash Regan in a bid to secure her vote in a bid to survive.\n\nRegan tells us that she wants him to prioritise independence, Grangemouth and safeguarding women and children. But behind the scenes, senior figures were becoming increasingly furious at the prospect of Alex Salmond's reemergence\n\n.\n\nSunday April 28\n\nThe First Minister believed an agreement with Regan could still save him, but the Sunday Mail's front page which declared \"Humza: I'll work with Salmond\" sent SNP officials into meltdown.\n\nThe plan to install Swinney as leader of the SNP and First Minister was enacted. Senior sources began briefing newspapers and broadcasters that Humza was resigning and Swinney was to take over. They were also told about a Resolution Foundation thinktank event in London the following day where Swinney was set to speak..\n\nA source said: \"At least two members of the government were determined at all costs not to allow a situation to develop which could see the SNP relying on Alba's support.As much as Humza wanted to cast this as a deal with Regan and not Salmond, the undeniable reality is that Salmond is the leader of the party.\n\n\"Very senior Sturgeon allies in the government and party made it clear that a deal with Alba could not go ahead under any circumstances.\n\n\"If he had been stronger Humza would have told them where to go, but by Sunday night he was no longer in control of his own destiny.'\n\nMonday April 29\n\nRegan texts the FM asking him if they are meeting. The FM calls her and said her requests to give him her support are \"very reasonable\".\n\nBut within a few hours, Humza appears in Bute House to resign.\n\nSalmond later tells reporters: \"The reason he didn't do a deal with Alba is because there are forces within his own party who stopped him doing it - let's call them the old guard.\"\n\nWithin hours MSPs and MPs including Stephen Flynn and M\u00e0iri McAllan were backing Swinney despite the fact he had not even announced he would stand. He tells reporters he is considering it.\n\nA SNP source said : \"It is incredibly stressful and disorientating to be the person at the centre of a political bun-fight and you need the people around you to be fighting your corner. Humza is going to wake up a few days from now and begin to wonder whether that was the case.\"\n\nTuesday April 30\n\nTory leader Douglas Ross announces he was withdrawing his party's planned vote of no confidence in Humza Yousaf, saying \"job done\" on their plans to oust the First Minister.\n\nLabour then faced pressure from the Greens and SNP to drop their motion of no confidence in the government as a whole.\n\nWednesday May 1\n\nThe Scottish Labour vote of no confidence in the government goes ahead but fails.\n\nKate Forbes reveals she is still considering standing as leader.\n\nSturgeon makes an appearance at Holyrood and denies \"working behind the scenes\" of the leadership contest. She says: \"I have spent almost my entire life in the thick of political drama and I'm actually quite enjoying not being in the thick of political drama any more.\"\n\nA source close to Nicola Sturgeon said: \"The Greens made their position on the vote of no confidence clear on the day the Bute House Agreement ended. That doesn't mean constructive relationships can't continue. Nicola talks to colleagues and former colleagues regularly - there is nothing surprising in that.\"\n\nA SNP spokesperson said: \"Humza Yousaf has set out in straight in terms what led to his decision to stand down as First Minister and SNP leader which included refusing to trade his values and principles, simply to retain power.\"\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond -

But what might that look like?\n\nThe SNP veteran has already said he wants Kate Forbes to play a \"significant part\". Ms Forbes, the former finance secretary, was considering her own leadership bid before pulling out on Thursday. She will be offered a \"very involved, senior position\", Mr Swinney told journalists.\n\nThere is speculation she could become his deputy and finance secretary. This role is currently filled by Shona Robison under Humza Yousaf. However, she was notably absent from Mr Swinney's campaign launch on Thursday morning, despite the presence of several other senior ministers, and some believe she is on the way out.\n\nSupporters of Ms Forbes see her possible return to the finance brief, which she held between 2020 and 2023, as a smart move that will help heal the party's divisions. One praised Mr Swinney's pitch to activists. \"Kate could have written that speech,\" they said.\n\nAnother SNP politician noted: \"I think, given everything that's been said, and given who she is, I think it would look strange if there was not some sort of economic brief.\"\n\nOne party source took it a step further. They pointed to the famous pact between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown in 1994, in which Mr Brown agreed not to run for the Labour leadership in return for control over economic and social policy as chancellor.\n\n\"What it needs to be is a Blair-Brown deal,\" they said. \"It can't be that Swinney's in charge and he tells her what to do. But he's not a delegator. He keeps a tight rein. There's no way he will do that. I know him. While I want to give him a chance, I'm not really holding my breath.\"\n\nThey said Ms Forbes would be a \"big, big improvement\" on Ms Robison.\n\nMr Swinney stressed the need for party unity during his campaign launch, and said he would build a \"cohesive, inclusive team\". There has been speculation he will seek to appoint some of Ms Forbes' supporters, such as the MSPs Michelle Thomson and Ivan McKee, to ministerial positions.\n\nMr McKee was previously a minister for business and trade under Nicola Sturgeon. However, his recent swipe at Mr Swinney in the pages of a tabloid newspaper may hinder any chance of a government comeback. \"Rushing to endorse a 'continuity' candidate at this early stage is eerily reminiscent of what happened in last year's contest - and we all know now how well that turned out,\" he wrote in the Daily Record on Wednesday.\n\nAside from Ms Forbes' return, some SNP insiders are not expecting major changes to the existing Cabinet. After all, a few senior ministers have simply not had time to make their mark.\n\nNeil Gray, for example, was only appointed health secretary in February. M\u00e0iri McAllan, who introduced Mr Swinney at his leadership campaign launch, was handed the new wellbeing economy, net zero and energy portfolio as part of the same reshuffle. She is expected to retain a big role.\n\nJenny Gilruth, the education secretary, is on the brink of outlining her vision for the sector. Mr Swinney, who previously held the education brief, will surely recognise the benefit of stability in this area, rather than more uncertainty.\n\nMs Gilruth backed Mr Swinney's leadership bid, as did most of her fellow Cabinet ministers, including culture secretary Angus Robertson, social justice secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville, transport secretary Fiona Hyslop and rural affairs secretary Mairi Gougeon.\n\n\"I would be surprised if there were massive, sweeping changes,\" said one party figure. However, they speculated about changes among the junior ministers.\n\nOne SNP politician said they suspected Mr Swinney would reduce the overall number of ministers, to make the Government \"smaller and more focused\". There are currently 26 ministers, including the 10-strong Cabinet. This amounts to around 40 per cent of SNP MSPs.\n\nThe end of the power-sharing deal between the SNP and the Greens saw the ministerial responsibilities previously held by Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, the Green co-leaders, absorbed into other briefs.\n\nOf course, reshuffles often contain surprises. As one MSP put it: \"I have been guessing reshuffles for a number of years now and always get them wrong. It's like picking lottery numbers.\"\n\nOne thing is fairly certain: Mr Swinney's top team will not include his predecessor. Mr Yousaf has made it clear he wants a break.\n\n\"First and foremost, I'm looking forward to a stint on the backbenches, because I've been a government minister for almost 12 years,\" he told journalists in the wake of his resignation. \"I don't really remember what life was like before being a government minister, and the workload, and the intensity of the pressure that comes with that. So I'll look forward to making a contribution from the backbenches.\"", "source": {"uri": "scotsman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scotsman"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The activist who thinks he can deliver indy in 12 months", "body": "Nominations in the process close at noon tomorrow and any candidate wishing to stand has to be nominated by 100 or more members over 20 different party branches.\n\nYesterday Mr McCormick told The Herald's Andrew Learmonth he was confident of reaching the required level of support.\n\nMr McCormick has been known before to be keen to take on senior figures in the party with issues he doesn't agree with.\n\nDuring the party's annual conference last year in described Humza Yousaf's independence strategy as \"flatulence in a trance\".\n\nHe told party delegates at the event in Aberdeen last October said: \"What we have here is flatulence in a trance because we are being offered things that nobody knows what we are talking about -- 'this thing' and 'that thing' and all the rest of it.\"\n\nMr McCormick challenged the then party's president Michael Russell for his role at last year's conference, losing by 79 votes to 599 in a ballot of delegates.\n\nIn his draft pitch to become SNP president sent to The Herald last year he promised he could deliver independence within a year.\n\nThe timescale would be eight months shorter than that proposed by Alex Salmond ahead of the 2014 referendum. The then First Minister's white paper suggested independence would be achieved on March 16, 2016, some 18 months after the September 2014 referendum if Scots had voted Yes.\n\n\"History tells us that there comes a point in the march of a nation when the old traditions must be replaced with the floodgates of opportunity to achieve our mission; Independence,\" he said.\n\n\"As National President I offer you the key to the floodgates so that Scotland will be an independent nation state in 12 months.\n\n\"But to get us over the line we, the members of the SNP, must embrace independence and not vacillate between just advancing independence and asking permission. We are a nation, not a pressure group.\"\n\nHe added: \"The next election must be the Independence Election just as Mr Yousaf said at Dundee. There has never been a better time to gain Independence. It is within our grasp.\n\n\"The electorate supports, or is broadly sympathetic to it, yet the SNP's appeal is waning.\n\n\"Therein lies the warning for the SNP. Managing Devolution is not now enough. We must replace it. Our politicians must lead us to deliver our historic purpose and all our candidates must show their full commitment to the Independence Plan to get us over the Line.\"\n\nMr McCormick, previously stood in 2021 for the role of party president but later withdrew his nomination saying he had ticked the box inadvertently.\n\nA solicitor by profession, he is convener of the SNP's Dumbarton constituency branch and a director of the pro Yes campaign organisation Business for Scotland.\n\nHe is not a well known figure outside the party, but is familiar to many inside the organisation where he is known to campaign on land reform issues.\n\nThe Herald has contacted Mr McCormick to find out if he will be putting his name forward before a deadline of noon tomorrow.He has not yet responded to The Herald's request.\n\nBut today he faces criticism from other figures in the party for challenging Mr Swinney and potentially drawing out the process of putting in place a new leader.\n\nSome fear a race could focus public attention on internal party divisions in the coming weeks ahead of a general election, expected later this year.\n\nPollster Mark Diffley noted the party's concerns on Twitter should Mr Cormick put himself forward.\n\n\"To put it mildly, if this happens it is not the situation that either John Swinney or the SNP will want. A three week series of debates and hustings which delays the inevitable, exposes divisions and costs money is not what the party needs right now,\" he said.\n\nIn TV interviews this morning, Mr Swinney warned potential rivals about entering the race saying it would \"delay the ability for the [party] to start its rebuilding\".\n\nResponding to his intervention, Gillian Martin, SNP MSP for Aberdeenshire East, and minister for energy, just transition and fair work, wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"The question anyone who cares about our cause should ask themselves is, are my actions furthering that cause? The question that anyone cares about our country should ask is, is what I'm doing good for my country. John Swinney can answer a confident yes on both counts.\"\n\nFormer SNP minister Marco Biagi, now a councillor in Edinburgh, wrote on X: \"While all 70k SNP members have the right under the party's constitution to stand for election as leader, anyone considering it desperately needs to grow a sense of perspective. Read the room.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the SNP announce the timetable of leadership contest.\n\nUnder the timetable, nominations opened on Monday 29 April at 11:59pm, will close at noon tomorrow, while\n\nany potential ballot would open on Monday 13 May at Noon and close on Monday 27 May at noon.\n\nWriting on X today some pro-Union activists appeared to relish to prospect of Mr McCormick standing.\n\nSam Taylor, who runs the pro-UK group These Islands, posted Mr McCormick's speech from last year's SNP conference.\n\n\"Leadership contender Graeme McCormick gets a rapturous reception at last year's special SNP conference in Dundee. (He proposes a unilateral declaration of independence.),\" he wrote.\n\nMr Taylor also noted: \"John Swinney writes off Graeme McCormick's chances before the contest has even begun. Very disrespectful.\"\n\nHe also wrote: \"Who is Graeme McCormick, the SNP activist rumoured to have secured the 100 nominations required to stand against John Swinney for the leadership? He made a name for himself at last year's conference with the memorable \"flatulence in a trance\" speech.\"", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"},

His presentation is often described as bank managerial, but in person his wry humour and comradely decency is much more in evidence. He is an active member of the Church of Scotland, and Labour's Jim Murphy - who was Scottish secretary at the time - once joked: \"There's nobody in Scotland who doesn't like John Swinney.\"\n\nThough firmly on the gradualist wing of the party when it comes to Scottish independence, he remained close to the more radical Alex Salmond, taking over after he unexpectedly quit as leader in 2000, until Swinney resigned in 2004 after party critics moved against him following a poor European elections result.\n\nHe went on to serve as an unstintingly loyal deputy to Salmond's successor, Nicola Sturgeon, surviving a vote of no confidence in 2021 after a row over the government providing its legal advice to the special Holyrood committee set up to examine the handling of harassment complaints against Salmond.\n\nLast year, after Sturgeon's home was searched and she and her husband, Peter Murrell, were arrested as part of the police investigation into SNP finances, Swinney chaperoned her around the Holyrood parliament, standing by her side as she spoke to reporters.\n\nThe SNP's return to minority government will demand the negotiating skills he is renowned for - he garnered plaudits for his protracted discussions with Westminster after the Smith commission, which gave further powers to Holyrood after the 2014 independence referendum. Swinney is admired for his steeliness as much as his quiet charm.\n\nWhen Sturgeon quit last spring, Swinney also announced his own return to the backbenches after 16 years as a cabinet secretary, expressing his desire to spend more time with his wife, Elizabeth, who has lived with multiple sclerosis for many years and with whom he has a son.\n\nIn his leadership acceptance speech on Monday, Swinney admitted he had been \"physically and mentally exhausted\" at that point but said that 12 months later he was \"rested and ready\".\n\nAlthough viewed as the ultimate safe pair of hands, last week Swinney nevertheless dismissed the notion that he would merely be a \"caretaker\", saying he intended to lead the party into the 2026 Holyrood elections and beyond.", "source": {"uri":

and all these problems are aggravated by sluggish economic growth.\n\nSwinney should put his hand up and say sorry to voters for SNP Government mismanagement.\n\nHe should admit his party has failed to prioritise the issues of importance to everyday Scots.\n\nHis predecessors spoke about the cost of living crisis, but they rarely followed through on the rhetoric.\n\nNicola Sturgeon and Humza Yousaf got sidetracked by gender law reform, the deposit return scheme and other low priority issues.\n\nAn apology could be a watershed moment for the Scottish Government and provide Swinney with the

will have no majority for anything and will need cooperation from opposition parties to push through a reset agenda.\n\nIf he is willing to reach out to political rivals, they should respond positively.\n\nThe main reason for his party's reliance on the Greens was the determination of the pro-UK parties to block the SNP on everything.\n\nNot only does this approach fail voters, but it undermines devolution by giving the impression of constant chaos at Holyrood.\n\nCutting waiting lists and growing the economy should be cross-party issues and not become hostages of petty politics.\n\nSwinney must also look at resetting relations with a future Labour Government at Westminster.\n\nThe current Tory administration is a right wing freak show that has abandoned any pretence of decency.\n\nA Starmer Government would be different and Swinney should be fleshing out possible areas of cooperation.\n\nHis comments about securing extra immigration powers were interesting, but so too was his praise for the last Labour-led Scottish Executive on the Fresh Talent Initiative.\n\nLabour and the SNP will never agree on independence and there is little prospect of this rift healing.\n\nBut Swinney and Starmer Governments could work together in the national interest and boost flagging support for devolution.\n\nTo sign up to the Daily Record Politics newsletter, click

The party is expected to lose up to 28 seats and, of course, much can change in the intervening months. But when some MPs who were confident about holding their seats a few months ago are now telling you they're not so sure it's a sign that this party is standing on the precipice of political oblivion.\n\nThis is reinforced by the number of SNP diehards telling me that they feel the party needs to experience a spell in opposition at Holyrood to recover fully from the damage wrought by Ms Sturgeon and her acolytes.\n\nNor can you over-estimate how much the Scottish Greens in government have damaged the SNP's reputation. The Bute House Agreement lasted almost three years, yet not once during this time did I ever hear an SNP supporter or Scottish nationalist ever say: \"The Scottish Greens have been good for us.\"\n\nAt Holyrood last week, on the day that it became clear that Mr Swinney was virtually assured of becoming First Minister, I expressed my bemusement to several MSPs that Mr Yousaf hadn't stood his ground and faced down the Sturgeon loyalists who have hollowed out this party. This was greeted with uncomfortable shrugs, but no denials.\n\nHe was, after all, the leader of a party that had won more than 10 elections in four different jurisdictions since 2007. He had become leader following a bruising six-week contest barely 14 months ago. He had decided to ditch the two Scottish Green ministers and to terminate their Harry Potter departments because it was becoming clear that they had become an electoral liability and a blight on the wider independence movement.\n\nThen it emerged that a subversive Star Chamber of Sturgeonistas had threatened to fillet him in last week's no-confidence votes if he cut a deal with Alba's Ash Regan. It was probably the first time in his gilded life and professional career when he'd ever encountered a hint of jeopardy.\n\nHe should have faced down this cabal and simply declared his intention to go to the electorate. Then he should have said something along the lines of \"you'd better hope I don't win. Because if I do, then I'll see to it that your careers in politics are over (insert your own profanities in the appropriate places)\".\n\nThe conduct and clandestine manoeuvring of this faction also confirmed something else many of us had long suspected: that this had never been about Scottish independence for them. Rather, to them the SNP exists merely as a conduit to impose a cultural revolution where science, reason and equality have been replaced by the magic beans of the gender cult. And all of it rooted in the intimidation of feminists and gay people.\n\nREAD MORE: How will a John Swinney and Kate Forbes government look?\n\nREAD MORE: Inside the Holyrood bubble: Kevin McKenna peeks behind the curtain\n\nREAD MORE: Only the people can sort out Humza Yousaf's mess\n\nThe extent to which he can bring back those many activists who have deserted the party specifically because of this will define his tenure.\n\nReports over the weekend suggest that the Sturgeon faction and the Scottish Greens are now gathering to resist any attempts by Mr Swinney to distance the party from self-ID. The Scottish Greens continue to delude themselves that they have any relevance in the lives of most people living in Scotland.\n\nThey're urging Mr Swinney not to dilute the proposed ban on conversion therapy, even though such a practice is inherently homophobic and seeks to remove vulnerable children from the protection of their parents.\n\nMr Yousaf's unwillingness to face down these malevolent forces emboldened them to bring him down. Mr Swinney simply cannot allow the Greens or the Sturgeon loyalists to dictate the future direction of his administration.\n\nHe could begin the task of marginalising them by appointing Kate Forbes to be his deputy and handing her the Finance brief. No one else in the party is better qualified to handle this area. And no one else is more capable than her of winning over the soft unionist votes required to get independence over the line when the opportunity next presents itself.\n\nHow will John Swinney deal with the transgender issue? (Image: Getty)Ms Forbes too must be prepared to play for keeps. Her Christian faith shouldn't prevent her from deploying dark political arts and stratagems to rout her opponents within the party. She is possessed of a far greater and more nimble intellect than they and enjoys the support of the party membership. She shouldn't be above using all of these to expose them and cast them aside.\n\nMr Swinney must also do as Anas Sarwar has now finally done and declare the scientific truth that transwomen are men and that the full findings of the Cass Review will be implemented with immediate effect. This aligns with the instincts and preferences of the overwhelming majority of Scottish voters.\n\nIf he retreats from these challenges - as his predecessor did - then his tenure will last barely much longer than his did.\n\nIn his acceptance speech yesterday after being formally installed as SNP leader he said his focus will be \"the economy, jobs; the cost of living. It will be the NHS, our schools and our public services.\" However, he'll simply not be taken seriously in any of these pursuits if he can't bring himself to state straightforward scientific truths.\n\nHe also said that while the SNP has a mandate to form the government \"it does not mean we can stop listening to people and voices outside our party.\n\nThe polarisation of politics does not serve our country well.\" Later, he said: \"We need to stop shouting at each other and talk. More than that, actually, we need to listen.\"\n\nNicola Sturgeon's refusal to listen to wise counsel inside her own party about the consequences of gender fanaticism and the bullying of females was exposed during the Isla Bryson and Andrew Miller scandals last year.\n\nIt's vital that Mr Swinney sends a clear message to the Scottish public that never again will any Scottish Government allow itself to be manipulated by the Scottish Greens, the most unsuccessful party in the history of the Parliament and the SNP's most expensive mistake.\n\nIf he allows them anywhere near the levers of power then his tenure will end at the 2026 Scottish election.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He has not yet responded to The Herald's request.\n\nBut today he faces criticism from other figures in the party for challenging Mr Swinney and potentially drawing out the process of putting in place a new leader.\n\nSome fear a race could focus public attention on internal party divisions in the coming weeks ahead of a general election, expected later this year.\n\nPollster Mark Diffley noted the party's concerns on Twitter should Mr Cormick put himself forward.\n\n\"To put it mildly, if this happens it is not the situation that either John Swinney or the SNP will want. A three week series of debates and hustings which delays the inevitable, exposes divisions and costs money is not what the party needs right now,\" he said.\n\nIn TV interviews this morning, Mr Swinney warned potential rivals about entering the race saying it would \"delay the ability for the [party] to start its rebuilding\".\n\nResponding to his intervention, Gillian Martin, SNP MSP for Aberdeenshire East, and minister for energy, just transition and fair work, wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"The question anyone who cares about our cause should ask themselves is, are my actions furthering that cause? The question that anyone cares about our country should ask is, is what I'm doing good for my country. John Swinney can answer a confident yes on both counts.\"\n\nFormer SNP minister Marco Biagi, now a councillor in Edinburgh, wrote on X: \"While all 70k SNP members have the right under the party's constitution to stand for election as leader, anyone considering it desperately needs to grow a sense of perspective. Read the room.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the SNP announce the timetable of leadership contest.\n\nUnder the timetable, nominations opened on Monday 29 April at 11:59pm, will close at noon tomorrow, while any potential ballot would open on Monday 13 May at Noon and close on Monday 27 May at noon.\n\nWriting on X today some pro-Union activists appeared to relish to prospect of Mr McCormick standing.\n\nSam Taylor, who runs the pro-UK group These Islands, posted Mr McCormick's speech from last year's SNP conference.\n\n\"Leadership contender Graeme McCormick gets a rapturous reception at last year's special SNP conference in Dundee. (He proposes a unilateral declaration of independence.),\" he wrote.\n\nMr Taylor also noted: \"John Swinney writes off Graeme McCormick's chances before the contest has even begun. Very disrespectful.\"\n\nHe also wrote: \"Who is Graeme McCormick, the SNP activist rumoured to have secured the 100 nominations required to stand against John Swinney for the leadership? He made a name for himself at last year's conference with the memorable \"flatulence in a trance\" speech.\"", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Herald_(Glasgow)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Herald (Glasgow)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_1974_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "February 1974 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Biagi_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marco Biagi (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillian_Martin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gillian Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeenshire_East_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aberdeenshire East (Scottish Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateral_declaration_of_independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unilateral declaration of independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Councillor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Councillor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dundee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dundee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/17302941/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 2010, "textEnd": 2018}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 2108, "textEnd": 2114}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 2143, "textEnd": 2149}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

I'm trying to think who exactly that is,\" she replied, perhaps betraying her 31 years.\n\nMs McAllan is likely to be rewarded for her support, though maternity leave opens the door for Kate Forbes to step in.

no confidence in Holyrood.\n\nThe former finance secretary, a close ally of Nicola Sturgeon, will now formally become First Minister later this week after a vote in the Scottish Parliament.\n\nSwinney has spoken of his intention to unite his party after it endured a miserable 14-month period following the shock resignation of Sturgeon in February 2023.\n\nHer exit from frontline politics came just weeks before Police Scotland ramped up a long-running investigation into SNP finances.\n\nSturgeon's resignation prompted the first open SNP leadership contest in 20 years and saw Yousaf become entangled in a bitter three-way race with Kate Forbes and Ash Regan.\n\nYousaf's year-long spell in Bute House saw the Nationalists slide in the polls and critics within the party openly criticise Sturgeon's legacy.\n\nSwinney must now attempt to put a positive spin on his decision to return as SNP leader two decades after he resigned from the job.\n\nKeith Brown, the SNP depute leader, claimed

Yes, snarled Swinney.", "body": "For a moment, it was almost as if he got it. Announcing his decision to stand as SNP leader on Thursday, John Swinney told his audience of supporters their party had to change.\n\n'We just can't go on the way we are,' he said. 'If we go on the way we are, we'll face tough times.'\n\nThe fact the SNP began facing the toughest of times some time ago, aside, this sounded like a rare example of a Nationalist politician indulging in a little self-reflection.\n\nThe SNP's obsession with holding a second independence referendum it has no power to deliver has shown contempt for both the pro-UK majority of Scots who want Ministers at Holyrood to focus on the issues that matter to them - the NHS, education and the economy - and Nationalists, cynically misled into believing a repeat of 2014 was imminent.\n\nAn SNP leader truly committed to change would recognise that some honesty on the constitutional question is long overdue.\n\nThe SNP's obsession with holding a second independence referendum shows contempt for the pro-UK majority of Scots who want to focus on more important issues\n\nThere will not be a referendum any time soon and, privately, senior SNP figures accept as much. Some say the question will not return for a generation.\n\nHowever, asked on Thursday whether he would lead Scotland to independence, Mr Swinney's affable smile fell.\n\n'Yes,' he snapped, then quickly moved on to another question. So much for the need for change.\n\nMr Swinney says he will unite Scotland 'for independence', which as evidence of poor country-reading skills takes some beating.\n\nMost Scots are sick and tired of the SNP's referendum monomania and if John Swinney doesn't recognise this soon then his leadership of his party will be brief.\n\nNicola Sturgeon paralysed Scotland while she pursued her obsession with breaking up the UK.\n\nPublic services were neglected as she and her senior colleagues - including her Deputy First Minister John Swinney - played petty constitutional games.\n\nMinisters invested money in pointless independence briefing papers while cutting budgets for vital services and refused to listen as voters - in poll after poll - said another referendum was at the bottom of their list of priorities.\n\nHow, I wonder, is Mr Swinney going to lead Scotland to independence?\n\nSupport for the SNP, mired in scandal, tied up in a police investigation, and hopelessly split on strategy and policy, is on the slide.\n\nThe new leader will be considered a miracle worker if he stops his party losing power.\n\nWhen Mr Swinney becomes First Minister, he will have no more right than his predecessors to hold a referendum.\n\nThere is no short-cut to secession, no wheeze - claiming an election is a 'de facto' referendum, for example - that will allow him to achieve his objective.\n\nScotland's seventh First Minister must start his time in office by doing something his predecessors could not. He must show some humility.\n\nScotland has been failed by the SNP. Ministers who promised stable government have let public services rot and decay while showboating about a referendum that was never coming.\n\nAnd it is not solely on the matter of independence that Mr Swinney will have to understand and respond to public concerns.\n\nDuring his campaign launch, a journalist raised the matter of identity politics which has been at the heart of many of the fiercest political debates of recent years.\n\nWhat, she asked, was Mr Swinney's view on whether a trans woman was a woman?\n\nHis response was pitiful.\n\n'If our politics is defined purely and simply by these questions,' said Mr Swinney, 'I think we're not addressing the core issues and challenges that people face.\n\nSo, today, I am going to address the core challenges and priorities that face people in our society.'\n\nIf the next First Minister thinks he can continue to dodge this question, he is very much mistaken.\n\nThe truth is the SNP's obsession, encouraged by Ms Sturgeon during her years in charge, with gender ideology has caused serious splits in the party and infuriated mainstream voters.\n\nMs Sturgeon ignored the warnings of feminists, the advice of legal experts and the opposition of a majority of voters to push ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, a move that would have allowed anyone to self-identify in the sex of their choosing.\n\nMs Sturgeon's SNP was so fully captured by gender ideologues that when Nationalist MP Joanna Cherry received death and rape threats for speaking out against the plans, nobody from the party's leadership team reached out to her to offer support.\n\nMs Cherry's entirely reasonable view that sex is a matter of biology saw her defamed as a bigot by scores of young SNP members.\n\nIt is to Ms Sturgeon's eternal shame that, even though she disagreed with Ms Cherry's views, she did not leap to her defence. So much for the SNP as a broad church, safe and welcoming for all.\n\nAnd when feminists who shared Ms Cherry's concern about an ideology that encourages young people who are confused about their gender to follow dangerous medical pathways and expects female victims of sexual violence to share their single-sex safe spaces with men spoke out, Ms Sturgeon treated them with sneering contempt.\n\nThe writer and philanthropist JK Rowling, the feminist activist and writer Julie Bindel, the SNP Minister (later to defect to Alba) Ash Regan and scores more women were dismissed by the then First Minister.\n\nMs Sturgeon declared herself the 'real' feminist.\n\nOn announcing her resignation as First Minister, she conceded she had become such a divisive figure that she could not advance the independence cause.\n\nOne of the things that played a significant part in her becoming such a polarising character was her hopeless misjudgment of the public mood on gender issues.\n\nThe subject was also to play its part in the end of Humza Yousaf's First Ministership.\n\nThose same campaigners concerned about the impact on women's rights of trans ideology are also opposed to the medicating of children suffering gender dysphoria. They feel the prescription of so-called 'puberty blocker' drugs and cross-sex hormones to children is unethical and dangerous.\n\nA number of SNP politicians -many too scared to speak up - feel the same.\n\nWhen Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie appeared on BBC Scotland's Sunday Show and refused to agree that the review by Dr Hilary Cass into NHS treatment of children and young people with gender dysphoria was a 'valid' scientific document, Nationalist backbenchers were outraged.\n\nThey could not countenance sharing the same space with a party that was playing down the dangers of 'puberty blockers' and undermining an important piece of scientific work.\n\nThe backlash from his members against Mr Harvie was the final straw for Mr Yousaf who tore up the Bute House Agreement, the power-sharing deal agreed by Ms Sturgeon and the Greens in 2021.\n\nSome politicians asked 'what is a woman?' try to squirm out of answering, dismissing it as a 'gotcha' question. It is nothing of the sort.\n\nPowerful lobbying groups - funded by taxpayers' cash by the SNP - have spent years trying to redefine what a woman is and it is perfectly reasonable to expect Mr Swinney to have come to a conclusion on the matter.\n\nThe way the SNP has traduced women with legitimate concerns about the demands of trans activists is revolting.\n\nThe party's next leader has bridges to build.\n\nPerhaps Mr Swinney could begin his leadership by apologising on behalf of his party to Ms Cherry for the way she was failed?\n\nThat might help him start convincing voters that he takes seriously their entirely legitimate concerns about the impact of dangerous gender ideology on the lives of confused young people and that he shares the majority belief that women must have single-sex spaces, free of men.\n\nIf John Swinney continues to focus on the SNP's twin obsessions of independence and gender ideology, he will lead his party to new lows in the polls.", "source": {"uri":

He is a favourite at the party conference and his admirers recognise in him a burning desire for independence.\n\nEdinburgh born and bred, the 60-year-old has something of the traditional Scottish banker about him, and indeed he spent five years working for Scottish Amicable Life Assurance before winning the Tayside North seat at Westminster in 1997.\n\nBut by then he was already a party veteran, having joined in 1979 aged just 15.\n\nHe ran the SNP's youth wing before climbing through senior roles in the national party, becoming its secretary at 22.\n\nMr Swinney is full of contradictions. He rose rapidly among the fiery young party activists yet there is something quite old-fashioned about him.\n\nHis cautious strain of nationalism was forged in the era of SNP leader Gordon Wilson, who headed the party from 1979 to 1990.\n\nYet he became a close and trusted colleague of the next leader, Alex Salmond, who had emerged from the more radical wing of the party.\n\nThrough his time at Westminster and then at Holyrood from 1999, he was a trusted lieutenant to Mr Salmond and so it seemed natural that he should succeed him in 2000, when the leader stood down.\n\nHis own time as leader, however, was not seen as a success. The early years of devolution were a surprisingly unhappy time for the party.\n\nThe Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition seemed to quell the nationalists. Seats were lost in the 2003 Holyrood election and there was a disappointing result in the 2004 European poll.\n\nTowards the end of his four years in the top job, it was clear his time as leader was over.\n\nHis party colleague Michael Russell borrowed from tales of Conservative fixers in grey suits to warn that Mr Swinney was facing a visit from \"the men in grey kilts\".\n\nMr Swinney was furious, and as he stood down launched a scathing attack on Mr Russell and other senior members of his party, blaming them for briefing against him and creating a \"fog of media speculation\" about his position.\n\nThose people \"should know better'\" than to \"import the grubby concepts from the Conservatives,\" he said.\n\n\"Our leader is democratically elected and, once democratically elected, should be supported by every single member of the party,\" he added.\n\nYet his ability to adapt and fit in, get on with the job and put duty first served him well when, after a spell on the back benches, he joined Mr Salmond's first government as finance secretary.\n\nIt was a job he would fill for the next nine years, adding the title deputy first minister to his office door when Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond in 2014.\n\nHe remained her loyal deputy, moving to take over the education brief in 2016.\n\nHis time in office was not without its problems. He was particularly criticised for falling standards in science and mathematics and survived two votes of no confidence while in the role, one in 2020 and the other a year later.\n\nJust two months after that second vote he was moved to head the Scottish government's response to Covid, while remaining Ms Sturgeon's deputy.\n\nAnd until this week that looked like being his final job in government. Just after Ms Sturgeon stood down in February 2023, he announced that he too was going, returning to the back benches after 16 years as a cabinet secretary.\n\nHe remains liked and respected by both colleagues and political opponents.\n\nBut remember those contradictions.\n\nPolite and moderate in person - and much funnier than on camera - Mr Swinney is also a ferocious parliamentary performer and has been a serious political operator for almost 40 years.\n\nAs he announced his candidacy he spoke of uniting the party for independence.\n\nAlmost his first act was to say there would be a place for Kate Forbes - who had considered a rival bid - in his government and he denied he would be a \"caretaker\" leader, saying he was in it to lead the SNP through the next Westminster and Holyrood elections.\n\nAlmost 20 years after standing down, John Swinney is stepping up once again.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

after being announced as the SNP's second new leader in the space of 13 months.\n\nSeveral high-profile figures in the party backed John Swinney as the best candidate for the post in the wake of Humza Yousaf's abrupt resignation as First Minister.\n\nThe parliamentarian thought to be his main challenger, Kate Forbes, announced she would not stand and backed his bid, as he said he hoped she would play a significant part in his team.\n\nMr Swinney, one of the original intake of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, is seen by many as being able to provide calm leadership at what is a time of political turmoil for Scotland's governing party.\n\nBut it is not be the first foray into the leadership for the former Tayside North MP.\n\nIn September 2000, he took over as leader following the first departure of Alex Salmond, having served as his deputy for two years previously.\n\nHis tenure was not a happy one.\n\nUnder his leadership, the SNP's fortunes slid, returning just five MPs at the 2001 Westminster election and 22 MSPs in the 2003 Holyrood vote.\n\nAfter seeing off an attempt to oust him by a party activist, Mr Swinney stepped down voluntarily after a poor showing at the 2004 European election.\n\nBut that was not the end of his political story as he was brought back by Mr Salmond to serve as finance secretary when the SNP took power in 2007.\n\nHe served in the role for the entirety of Mr Salmond's tenure, before being appointed deputy first minister by Nicola Sturgeon when she took over.\n\nOver the following nine years, the Perthshire North MSP occupied several ministerial offices in the Scottish Government, including as education secretary, Covid-19 recovery secretary and again in finance, taking over that brief from Ms Forbes while she was on maternity leave.\n\nDuring his time as Ms Sturgeon's deputy, he cemented his reputation as a dogged defender of his boss, as well as an SNP stalwart.\n\nBut it was not without its challenges, as he faced two close no confidence votes in Holyrood, first over the handling of school exams during the pandemic, and his initial refusal to publish legal advice during the inquiry into the botched handling of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond.\n\nThe election of Mr Yousaf as first minister saw Mr Swinney call time on his career in the Scottish Cabinet, but he is now gearing up to take the helm.",

So there's been an immediate lift from the discussions, which John Swinney has had first of all with Kate Forbes and it now appears Graeme McCormick,\" Brown said.\n\nMcCormick, a serial rebel who told the party's conference last year that the SNP's independence strategy was \"flatulence in a trance\", had initially told his allies he wanted to stop Swinney winning the leadership unopposed.\n\nMcCormick had claimed over the weekend he would secure the 100 nominations needed to stand before the noon deadline on Monday after approaching activists at an All Under One Banner pro-independence rally on Saturday.\n\nLate on Sunday evening, he announced he had pulled out, after a \"lengthy and fruitful conversation\" with Swinney.\n\n\"John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP, our government and our people face, and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident, as they are advanced, will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months,\" McCormick said.\n\nBrown said Swinney's persuasiveness was evidence of his ability to bring different parts of the party together. \"I don't think 'lean on him' is true,\" Brown said.\n\n\"We've seen repeated references to stitch-up, some backroom deals and coronations and so on, and also the idea of a contest, it can't be just a contest of ideas. It's got to be divisive. That's not the case. What you've seen, as has been reported, is discussions taking place from somebody who wants to stand for leadership, John Swinney, positive discussions with other people in the party, the party coming together in a way that it hasn't done for some months, and looking very positive and united.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_Scotland", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Brown_(Scottish_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keith Brown (Scottish politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian independence movement"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/de5f4d6d43a6f6af974809f79da612ce", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

deputy first minister is now set to become first minister after being announced as the SNP's second new leader in the space of 13 months.\n\nSeveral high-profile figures in the party backed John Swinney as the best candidate for the post in the wake of Humza Yousaf's abrupt resignation as First Minister.\n\nThe parliamentarian thought to be his main challenger, Kate Forbes, announced she would not stand and backed his bid, as he said he hoped she would play a significant part in his team.\n\nMr Swinney, one of the original intake of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, is seen by many as being able to provide calm leadership at what is a time of political turmoil for Scotland's governing party.\n\nBut it is not be the first foray into the leadership for the former Tayside North MP.\n\nIn September 2000, he took over as leader following the first departure of Alex Salmond, having served as his deputy for two years previously.\n\nHis tenure was not a happy one.\n\nUnder his leadership, the SNP's fortunes slid, returning just five MPs at the 2001 Westminster election and 22 MSPs in the 2003 Holyrood vote.\n\nAfter seeing off an attempt to oust him by a party activist, Mr Swinney stepped down voluntarily after a poor showing at the 2004 European election.\n\nBut that was not the end of his political story as he was brought back by Mr Salmond to serve as finance secretary when the SNP took power in 2007.\n\nHe served in the role for the entirety of Mr Salmond's tenure, before being appointed deputy first minister by Nicola Sturgeon when she took over.\n\nOver the following nine years, the Perthshire North MSP occupied several ministerial offices in the Scottish Government, including as education secretary, Covid-19 recovery secretary and again in finance, taking over that brief from Ms Forbes while she was on maternity leave.\n\nDuring his time as Ms Sturgeon's deputy, he cemented his reputation as a dogged defender of his boss, as well as an SNP stalwart.\n\nBut it was not without its challenges, as he faced two close no confidence votes in Holyrood, first over the handling of school exams during the pandemic, and his initial refusal to publish legal advice during the inquiry into the botched handling of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond.\n\nThe election of Mr Yousaf as first minister saw Mr Swinney call time on his career in the Scottish Cabinet, but he is now gearing up to take the helm.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Making people believe its empty promises", "body": "For 17 years of abject failure, the SNP prioritised soundbite over substance. Now it falls to John Swinney to maintain the illusion that his party is delivering\n\nThe energising skirl of the bagpipes echoed across the Firth of Clyde on the rainy morning of November 21, 2017.\n\nThe sky may have been grey but the mood among the crowd, sheltering under a canopy of umbrellas, was sunny.\n\nThose gathered at Ferguson Marine in Port Glasgow were - quite understandably - excited because after years of community decline, here was what they dared to hope might be the rebirth of the shipbuilding industry.\n\nNicola Sturgeon, then the all-powerful leader of the SNP and First Minister, stepped up to a podium and quieted the crowd.\n\nOn a slipway in front of her stood MV Glen Sannox, one of two passenger ferries ordered, under a \u00a397million contract, by the Scottish Government.\n\nThree SNP stooges: Sturgeon, Salmond and Swinney are serial failures\n\n'This,' she told her audience, 'is a very emotional occasion, as all ship launches are.\n\nBut this is emotional in particular because of the very special place the shipyard has in the heart of this community and indeed in the heart of Scotland.'\n\nCalling for God's blessing on the ferry and all who sail on her, Ms Sturgeon released the traditional champagne bottle, which smashed on the hull before the vessel slipped into the water.\n\nThe cheers were deafening.\n\nHowever, this triumphant moment was not all it seemed. In fact, it was a sham.\n\nThe ferry was very far from being completed.\n\nIt looked the part, all right, but its windows were painted on, its funnels didn't work and the bow wasn't fit for purpose.\n\nCould there be a more perfect metaphor for the SNP's 17-year political reign in Scotland?\n\nWhile the Nationalists have enthusiastically told a story of progress and achievement, the truth is they have done nothing of substance with the powers they hold.\n\nFrom a distance, they might look like a government of competence, but get up close and you can see the bits they've painted on.\n\nThe reason for this is simple; at the heart of the SNP's political project is a void, a great echoing black hole of nothing.\n\nThere are no serious ideas, only monomania about achieving the chaotic break-up of the UK.\n\nThere is no drive to create a better country using the powers of Holyrood, only the destructive urge to foment anger and division.\n\nA LMOST seven years after what turned out to be nothing more than a stunt, neither MV Glen Sannox nor its sister ferry MV Glen Rosa are in service, while costs have soared to more than \u00a3360million.\n\nSNP ministers insisted the new ferries be built on the Clyde not because it was the option that offered best value for the Scottish taxpayer, but because of the symbolism of the deal.\n\nThe Nationalists wished to give the impression they had brought the once-thriving Scottish shipbuilding industry back to life.\n\nSymbolism is, of course, all important to the SNP which, since taking power in 2007, has prioritised introducing legislation that might bolster their story of Scots as uniquely different to the English.\n\nThis instinct to prioritise storytelling over substance was evident from the moment the SNP took control.\n\nLook at the Nationalists' approach to the NHS, for example. In opposition, Ms Sturgeon insisted only her party could protect the health service.\n\nIts health spokesman at the time told us that, under Labour (which, it might be uncomfortable for SNP members to remember, created the NHS at the same time some senior Nats were still regretting the Allies' victory in the Second World War), the NHS was in terminal decline.\n\nBut what, when the SNP won the 2007 election, was their big idea to improve services? With much fanfare, the SNP extended the existing provision of free prescriptions to include the wealthy and took the ticket machines out of hospital car parks.\n\nThese were policies that spoke of good old fashioned Scottish compassion and common sense, apparently.\n\nIn fact, there was little sense in directing resources away from those areas of the service that needed investment.\n\nThe prescriptions policy costs more than \u00a350million a year. Common sense would, for example, have been to use that money to hire more medical staff to deal with the needs of an ever-growing elderly population.\n\nAnd when, finally, the SNP Government did begin to address the problem of growing waiting lists and delays for treatment, their solution was as hollow as any other SNP wheeze.\n\nMinisters put new waiting time guarantees into statute, placing upon themselves a legal obligation to keep their promises.\n\nThis certainly looked like a government taking things seriously but there was just one small problem with the new law.\n\nMinisters neglected to include in the legislation any meaningful sanction for failure to meet these now legally binding guarantees.\n\nThis is a law - and we should use the word loosely in this instance - that may be broken with impunity.\n\nThe SNP instinct to prioritise imagery over action grew stronger when Ms Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond as First Minister.\n\nWhen the Nationalists wished to present Scotland as uniquely compassionate towards children, did they target investment towards areas of deprivation?\n\nDid they focus on solving already identified problems in schools such as the tendency of many boys to slip academically and go off the rails socially during the transition years between primary and secondary school?\n\nOf course, Ms Sturgeon's government did none of these things. Instead, it pushed ahead with plans to appoint a state guardian to every child.\n\nThe dangerously illiberal Named Person Act was supposed to send a signal to the world that Scotland really cared about its kids.\n\nThe problem was that this proposed intrusion into the lives of every family in the country was not, itself, legal.\n\nMinisters hadn't put the effort into thinking about whether the law was workable. It fell to the Supreme Court to tell them it was not, on the grounds that it breached human rights law.\n\nJust about every SNP Government promise made during the eras of Ms Sturgeon and Humza Yousaf has been hollow. And Scots have paid a price for that.\n\nBoth leaders' obsessions with delivering a referendum have put Scotland on hold.\n\nNeither dared take on any difficult challenges as they feared the risk of controversy that might harm the independence cause.\n\nThis cowardice renders all SNP claims towards radical progress utterly hollow.\n\nSNP First Ministers may have delivered speech after speech about how committed they are to driving up standards in schools and creating an NHS fit to meet the demands of the 21st century but their words have meant nothing.\n\nReality shows us as much.\n\nYears of soundbite-over-substance have seen the NHS lurch towards breaking point and standards in literacy and numeracy among children slide, while empty promises of action in place of ideas for change mean there has been next to no progress on tackling Scotland's shameful level of drug-related deaths.\n\nJohn Swinney's imminent return as party leader tells us a great deal about the void at the heart of the SNP's project.\n\nMr Yousaf, for the time being, has two deputies. Keith Brown is deputy leader of the SNP, while Shona Robison is Deputy First Minister.\n\nThese are, by any standard, substantial roles in Scotland's party of government.\n\nWasn't it remarkable, then, that when Mr Yousaf announced his resignation on Monday, there was absolutely no suggestion within SNP ranks that either Mr Brown or Ms Robison might step up?\n\nF or years, the SNP has boasted of the breadth and depth of its pool of talent while attacking its opponents for being tired and out of ideas.\n\nHow does that story of the SNP as home to the brightest and best in our politics marry up to the reality of the return to leadership of Mr Swinney, whose last spell in charge between 2000-04 was disastrous?\n\nOne might make the argument for Kate Forbes, the former Finance Secretary who, rather than standing against Mr Swinney has accepted his offer to join his new Cabinet in a senior role, as a politician of some substance but beyond her, when it comes to talent, the SNP has produced nobody of note since Alex Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney got together more than three decades ago.\n\nMr Swinney's return is an admission of failure by the SNP. And no amount of SNP spin can divert us from that truth.\n\nThe party wishes Scots to unite around the idea that Mr Swinney represents change for Scotland.\n\nThat's quite the ask, what with Mr Swinney having spent most of his career at the very top of an SNP government that has so conspicuously failed Scotland.\n\nFor all but one of the 17 years of decline in public services under the mismanagement of the SNP, Mr Swinney was one of the most powerful and influential figures in government.\n\nHe encouraged and supported Ms Sturgeon throughout almost a decade where the Scottish Government prioritised agitating for a second referendum over addressing the priorities of the Scottish people.\n\nWhen Ms Sturgeon was on her feet in the Holyrood debating chamber, angrily dismissing concerns over the hugely unpopular and ultimately unworkable plan to reform the Gender Recognition Act, Mr Swinney was by her side, thumping his desk in support.\n\nAnd when Ms Sturgeon was ignoring the advice of business leaders and pushing up income tax for Scots workers, Mr Swinney was fully on board.\n\nCan Mr Swinney really offer the change Scotland needs when, the last time he was in office, his government showed absolutely no interest in the needs of the entrepreneurs and wealth creators who keep the economy afloat.\n\nAnd what do Scots get for all the extra tax they pay? An ever worsening slate of public services, that's what.\n\nHow can a man who helped lay the foundations for the current crisis in the SNP - and its impact on a nation being so poorly served by a dysfunctional government - be the agent for change?\n\nLittle more than a year ago, Mr Swinney stepped down as Deputy First Minister, making it clear his days on the frontline were over.\n\nThere was, he said, a breadth of talent in the SNP at Holyrood. He and Ms Sturgeon were leaving the party in capable hands, whoever became the next leader. And then Humza Yousaf got the job.\n\nW HEN it comes to talent, the SNP has always made a little go a long way.\n\nThe electoral surge which led to it gaining an unprecedented Holyrood majority in 2011 was not achieved because of the remarkable calibre of its candidates but because of the campaigning skills of a very small group of people at the top of the party.\n\nA cadre of Mr Salmond, Mr Swinney, Ms Sturgeon, her husband and then SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, spin doctor Kevin Pringle (who was hired for that role by Mr Yousaf) and the MSP Bruce Crawford, whose skill in cutting deals with rival parties when the Nationalists ran a minority government were crucial to the SNP's ongoing success.\n\nThat team created the illusion of substance in Nationalist ranks.\n\nThe reality, however, was that during the time Ms Sturgeon and Mr Swinney were running the show, they had so little faith in the abilities of Cabinet secretaries that they effectively micromanaged each of them, making key decisions over the heads of ministers across all portfolios.\n\nThis lack of talent has contributed to years of hollow government.\n\nWhile party leaders have spent much of their time agitating for referendums they had no power to deliver, their Cabinets have been stuffed with intellectual lightweights whose analysis of the needs of families across Scotland stretches little further than blind faith in the idea that breaking up the UK is the answer to everything.\n\nFar too many of their MSPs think pushing a big red button marked 'independence' will transform Scotland.\n\nSNP spinners talk of the party's record in government as one of progress and change but the reality is that years of Nationalist leadership are marked by inaction and missed opportunity.\n\nOh, cries the pious Nationalist, what about the baby box? Isn't that proof of our government's progressive politics?\n\nThe answer is no. This much vaunted 'proof' of wise government is - with its packs of nappies and bibs - perfectly useful but studies show its provision does nothing to improve the lot of children born into deprivation. It is just another hollow Nationalist symbol, an empty gesture.\n\nJohn Swinney will be First Minister within days. He will be the SNP's seventh leader at Holyrood since 1999. The roll call will run: Alex Salmond, John Swinney, Nicola Sturgeon (holding the fort while Mr Salmond was at Westminster), Alex Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon, Humza Yousaf and John Swinney.\n\nDoes that sound like a party of fresh ideas and new beginnings to you?\n\nThe idea we're finally about to enter an era of substantial, reforming government under the SNP is as convincing as the windows of the MV Glen Sannox on that wet November morning in 2017.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Labour rising. Is this really the dawn of something else?", "body": "But is that the future, or merely a reanimation of the past? For most of my life, even in the Tory-leaning north-east where I grew up, voting anything other than Labour was the sort of thing that made you an outlier and, in most places, the sort of thing that was a complete waste of time too. In more recent years, the same thing's applied to the SNP, one monoculture replaced with another. What we need is a bit of biodiversity.\n\nBut what will we get? According to the new poll, which was carried out by Norstat for The Sunday Times, the SNP would hold on to just 15 of their 43 seats at the general election. At Holyrood, they'd get slightly more support but according to analysis of the polling by Sir John Curtice, Labour would still become the largest party there too. The question now, says Sir John, is whether the election of John Swinney will enable the SNP to turn the page.\n\nGood question. I spoke to Sir John the other day about all of this and the subject of trends returning from the past came up quite a bit. Specifically - because his record for predicting the political future is so very good - I asked him where he thought we were going this time. Sturgeon gone, Yousaf gone, Tories in freefall, Labour on the rise. In some ways, this feels like 1997 again: a big old turnaround. So is that where we're headed?\n\nSort of. Sir John was definitely up for talking about '97 because it's the subject of an event he's doing at the Boswell Book Festival in Ayrshire this weekend. But he was also keen to point out that, although the current situation has some similarities to Blair's first big victory (government party divided, political reputation trashed, opposition on the rise) there are serious differences too. Be in no doubt, Labour's going to win the election, but the interesting bit is why, and how.\n\nOne of the biggest factors is Tony Blair himself. In some ways, Sir John believes it wasn't actually Blair wot did it in '97 - had John Smith lived, he says, Labour would have won anyway, so unpopular were the Tories. But he does point out that Blair was able to generate a sense of enthusiasm for his party in a way that Keir Starmer can't, and Humza Yousaf can't. So there isn't the overwhelming passion for Labour there was in '97 and the English local election results would seem to prove that. The lack of passion will undoubtedly affect things in Scotland too.\n\nBut assuming a win for Starmer at the general election - and Sir John has said there's a 99% chance of it happening - I asked him if he was able to put a percentage on Anas Sarwar becoming First Minister. Too early, he said, and for good reason: Labour will be coming into power against the backdrop of an economy that may still be stuttering and lo and behold public services may continue to struggle and they'll have to put up taxes. Give that another couple of years and Labour (and therefore Scottish Labour) may be none too popular by the time of the next Holyrood election, considerably damaging Mr Sarwar's chances.\n\nHow things will pan out at the general election is also up for grabs. Effectively at the moment, there's a battle going on about how to frame the election north of the border. Labour want to sell it as \"you want to get the Tories out, therefore vote for us\" whereas the SNP is saying \"if you want independence, you need to vote for us\". In fact, it's much simpler than that: it's Labour that's taking votes off the SNP so it's Labour the SNP need to focus on and to a great extent the result will depend on how well they can do this.\n\nThe problem according to Sir John is there are a number of serious drags on the SNP's ability to do the job. Firstly, the party is divided (and John Swinney may or may not be able to fix that). Secondly, the constitutional question that's worked in the SNP's favour does not dominate Scottish politics in the way it once did. And thirdly (and some might say about time too) more voters are making the connection between the state of hospitals, schools and so on and the SNP.\n\nRead more: John Curtice on the SNP's biggest problem: it all goes back to Sturgeon\n\nRead more: Mark Smith: New leader's top priority should be to end the culture of 'free stuff'\n\nThe result is the emergence of a new species of voter: voters who until recently were pretty firmly SNP but are now willing to break away and vote for Labour. Some of them are probably doing it not because they're passionate about Labour 1997-styley, but because they feel like they have no choice - the Tories are terrible, the SNP are terrible, so we might as well give these guys a chance. Also significant is the fact that something similar isn't happening on the unionist side; Tory or Labour supporters going across to the SNP in any significant numbers just isn't going to happen, John Swinney or no John Swinney.\n\nAll of this lays the groundwork for a bad general election for the SNP. As Sir John pointed out after the poll at the weekend, even among those who reported they'd vote Yes in another referendum, only 56% of them said they'd be willing to support the SNP for Westminster. This is a new development and means the projection of the SNP going from 43 seats to 15 is perfectly possible-slash-probable-slash-it's going to happen isn't it?\n\nThe longer term? Less certain. Sir John told me there was a time when politics in Scotland had almost become like it was in Northern Ireland: completely polarised. But that's now fractured somewhat and what that means for the general election is becoming increasingly clear: Labour dominance, possibly including Scotland.\n\nBut the recent polling shows something else as well: it shows support for independence is still high at 48%, and that's a strong base on which to build. Undoubtedly, the deflector shield of independence is no longer what it once was. But if and when Labour stumble (and they will) and if and when the SNP find a good leader again (and they will), it could be deflector shields on max again captain. It could be game on.\n\nSir John Curtice is at the Boswell Book Festival on May 11 at 6.30pm", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tony Blair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smith_(Labour_Party_leader)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Smith (Labour Party leader)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Curtice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Curtice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sunday Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayrshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ayrshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Labour", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anas_Sarwar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anas Sarwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unionism_in_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unionism in Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/17534442/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 6059, "textEnd": 6065}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Today, the SNP is in the deepest crisis of its 90-year history. Public support is sliding and the sudden resignation of leader Humza Yousaf has exposed bitter divisions among nationalist ranks. John Swinney, deputy to Nicola Sturgeon during her nine years as first minister, is the sole candidate to replace Yousaf. But for all his experience, he may struggle to revive a party which has slumped from dizzying heights.\n\nAfter becoming the largest party in the Holyrood parliament in 2007, the nationalists swiftly supplanted Labour as the dominant political power in Scotland. Over the years that followed, Alex Salmond and then Nicola Sturgeon cemented the party's position as the preference of almost half of voters. Poll after poll suggested their grip on power in Scotland was unshakeable.\n\nBut the SNP's own narrative -- that it's a uniquely moral and progressive party for a uniquely moral and progressive country -- has now been shattered by events. After the chaos of the past 10 days, senior party figures are unanimous in their support for Swinney though his spell as leader between 2000-2004 was a disaster. The situation does not suggest a party overflowing with talent or ideas.\n\nYousaf is responsible for his own downfall. His decision to end the power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens, which deprived him of a governing majority, blew up in his face. Attempts over last weekend to build bridges were entirely unsuccessful and Yousaf fell on his sword.\n\nBut the crisis in Scottish nationalism began under Sturgeon, who replaced Salmond as SNP leader and first minister after defeat in the 2014 independence vote.\n\nSalmond increased support by recognising the power -- and responding to the desires -- of small-c conservative Scotland. Policies such as free university tuition and prescriptions appealed to the suburban middle classes. With Sturgeon as his deputy and Swinney as a sober finance secretary, Salmond built a fortress on the middle ground.\n\nWhen Sturgeon took over, she promised to respect the referendum result -- 55-45 in favour of the staying in the UK -- and govern for all Scots, regardless of their position on the constitutional question.\n\nThis pledge lasted longer than a Liz Truss premiership but only just. While leader, Sturgeon repeatedly promised a second referendum that she had no power to deliver. Meanwhile, she moved her party to the left, basing her arguments on the myth of a radical Scotland, wildly different in its views and instincts to England. The policy agenda, including a failed attempt to reform the Gender Recognition Act, set her at odds with many of the voters who put the nationalists in power.\n\nSwinney has already made clear he intends to set a course back towards the electorate, declaring that he stands with \"the majority\" in the \"moderate, centre-left of politics\". He warned there was work to do persuading more Scots to back independence.\n\nRepeated election victories may -- understandably -- have given the impression that Sturgeon had her finger on Scotland's pulse. But the reality was that, post-referendum, Scots divided behind the parties which represented their views on the constitution. This allowed Sturgeon to demand she be judged on her record on education, safe in the knowledge that almost half the voters wouldn't look too hard and would continue to back the nationalists regardless of policy failures.\n\nAnd so Sturgeon travelled the world, an admired ambassador for a successful, progressive Scotland that existed only in imagination. And, all the while, the nationalists -- fearful that difficult reforms might backfire and stall independence plans -- neglected the NHS, education and economy.\n\nWhen she resigned last February, Yousaf was the continuity candidate but foolishly he then tried to govern as a continuity national leader. He pressed on with her agenda, promising independence was one last heave away (it wasn't) and pursuing controversial policies on gender and hate speech when voters' priorities were the cost of living, education and health.\n\nIn a bizarre development, Police Scotland raided SNP headquarters and the Glasgow home Sturgeon shares with her husband, former SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, investigating allegations of financial impropriety. Murrell has now been charged with embezzlement.\n\nSwinney will inherit a party divided both on how to achieve independence and on the so-called culture war, with Scottish Labour resurgent. He may be able to slow the SNP's decline but there is very little chance of him being the leader to take Scotland out of the UK. Senior figures now accept the independence argument is dead for a generation. Privately, they admit they've nobody but themselves to blame.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But I wonder if - as John Swinney prepares to take the helm uncontested - Labour and the Tories feel they miscalculated too; that by seeking to capitalise on the SNP's troubles, they whipped up troubles of their own.\n\nBecause having brought Yousaf down, what are they left with as they head into a General Election? A more experienced and well-liked First Minister, and an SNP that's stopped fighting like rats in a sack.\n\nThis is suboptimal for Scottish Labour which has looked set to rise on the SNP's fall (the latest poll suggested it will gain 26 Scottish seats, while the SNP will lose 24). But it is catastrophic for the Scottish Tories, who were already forecast to lose one of their six Scottish MPs, and who are facing up to the party's worst local election results for more than 40 years along with a crushing Blackpool byelection defeat.\n\nAll of this comes with caveats. Swinney may be popular, experienced and invested with a degree of \"elder statesman\" gravitas but he, too, has his flaws.\n\nHis last spell as party leader ended with a visit from the infamous \"men in grey kilts\". In his time as education secretary, he presided over the 2020 results debacle and faced two no confidence votes.\n\nHis \"knight on a white charger\" schtick at his press conference last week was faintly embarrassing. The SNP remains in a parlous state. After 17 years in power, it is exhausted and out of ideas.\n\nSwinney can do nothing to dispel the shadow cast by the embezzlement charges against its former chief executive Peter Murrell and - given he was criticised for a 'lack of candour' in his report into the Edinburgh trams scandal - his \"honest John\" tag may be overstated.\n\nYet, within the realms of the possible, his forthcoming \"anointment\" is the best outcome the party could have hoped for. It avoids a repeat of last year's brutal leadership contest (and the bad blood that lingers on). Swinney may not lift the beleaguered party out of its current doldrums and into a bright new era, but there is no-one better placed to steady the ship..\n\nSwinney's first asset is that everyone understands he is a reluctant leader. He has - as he himself has stressed - been trying to escape frontline politics since 2016. This means - unlike some of the younger, fresher MSPs - he ought to be driven less by personal ambition than what he perceives to be the best interests of the party and the country.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with personal ambition - it can prove a powerful, energising factor. But, right now, what the SNP needs is less: \"How can I play off the warring factions to my own advantage?\" and more: \"How can I bring those factions together?\"\n\nLong-buried tensions\n\nAs we know, Nicola Sturgeon's departure brought the party's long-buried tensions exploding to the surface. Of all the fault lines running through the SNP and the wider independence movement, the most likely to produce an off-the-Richter scale earthquake - has been trans rights, with the \"gender critical wing\" pitting itself against the \"progressives\" (and vice versa).\n\nThe tension with the Greens was rooted in its support for trans rights, with many party members believing it was driving SNP policy. The severing of the deal came after co-leader Patrick Harvie criticised the Cass review and the decision to pause the prescription of puberty blockers.\n\nThis fault line deepened when \"continuity candidate\" Yousaf took on social and fiscal conservative Kate Forbes in the battle to replace Sturgeon last year. Winning by a tiny margin - and with the help of votes cast less for him than against his rival - the victor was in no position to kick-start a healing process.\n\nThe gulf between Yousaf's economic vision and Forbes' was so wide he could not keep her on as finance secretary, and - both smart and driven - she was never going to settle for his offer of the rural affairs job. And so off she went to the backbenches where she became a magnet for internal disaffection.\n\nWhat Labour and the Tories were hoping for, no doubt, as they watched Yousaf crash and burn, was Round Two; another vicious ding-dong. And, initially, everything seemed to be going their way. With Forbes the most obvious leadership candidate, trenches were quickly dug around her Wee Free faith.\n\nOn one side stood those who saw her opposition to abortion and same sex marriage as an impediment to becoming First Minister, on the other those who held any attack on her retrogressive beliefs as misogyny and anti-Christian discrimination.\n\nWithin a matter of hours, the atmosphere had grown febrile, with angry columns, slanging matches and Twitter pile-ons all seized upon by Anas Sarwar and Douglas Ross as evidence of a party and government dissolving into chaos.\n\nSwinney's apparent coronation undermines that perception and offers the possibility of reconciliation. Neither \"woke\" enough to provoke those on the gender critical wing, nor socially conservative enough to be anathema to the Greens, he has called for an end to polarisation.\n\nMore importantly, perhaps, he shares Forbes' fiscal conservatism. Whatever you think about this, it does mean he will be able to offer her a prominent Cabinet position such as finance secretary and/or Deputy FM; to bring her back inside the tent, where her talents can be harnessed and her potential for damage neutralised.\n\nGreater unity\n\nForbes' decision not to stand against him suggests she, too, recognises the need for greater unity. Or maybe she just thinks it would be better for her to wait until a potentially disastrous General Election is over.\n\nEither way, the impact of their deal is already being felt. Swinney's promise to govern from the mainstream - the moderate left - seems to have calmed frayed nerves. Some of those who backed Forbes are now throwing their weight behind Swinney. One of Forbes' most vocal supporters, Joanna Cherry, has said that, while she would have preferred a contest, she understands the acrimony it would have generated is not desirable at this point.\n\nAs for Alex Salmond's Alba - which briefly saw Ash Regan as a kingmaker - it overplayed its hand and was sent back off into the wilderness.\n\nIt would be naive to suggest the SNP's problems are over or that infighting will cease. Whether or not the party wins the most seats in the 2026 Holyrood election (and a period out of government might be to its advantage) many matters remain to be resolved. Forbes' long-term leadership ambitions have not been dampened.\n\nAt some point, the question of whether it is possible for her to separate her beliefs from her politics will have to be thrashed out (although the fact she voted in favour of abortion clinic buffer zones was reassuring). Cherry made it clear that, for her and others, a reset is still a priority.\n\nFinally, of course, there is the question of independence. In his resignation speech Yousaf suggested it was \"frustratingly close\" - something no-one on either side of the constitutional divide believes.\n\nIt was refreshing to hear Swinney being more candid, and promising to focus on bread and butter issues such as poverty, health and education. But at some point, SNP supporters are going to expect progress on a second referendum, and he has no more of a magic wand at his disposal than his predecessors.\n\nStill, for now, the party appears to be more stable and harmonious than it's been since Sturgeon's resignation. How galling that must be for Douglas Ross, who was so recently congratulating himself on his part in Yousaf's downfall.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

It won't work. John Swinney will be an excellent first minister and party leader - and he has my full support.\"\n\nParty hopes to mend divisions\n\nHumza Yousaf's leadership collapsed following a number of failed policies spearheaded by the Greens, such as the deposit return scheme and Gender Recognition Reform Bill, as well as abandoned flagship climate goals.\n\nHe also faced criticism for failing to find a way to bring one-time leadership rival Kate Forbes into his Cabinet.\n\nIt is understood Forbes will now be offered a significant role as part of Swinney's top team. Party figures hope the move will help to mend divisions.\n\nPerthshire South and Kinross-shire MSP Jim Fairlie, whose constituency neighbours John Swinney's, said the level of unity felt among the SNP group in Parliament on Thursday is one he has never experienced before.\n\nHe said Greens co-convener Patrick Harvie's refusal to say if he backs the Cass review into gender services was set to present more problems for Yousaf before the plug was pulled on the SNP-Green power sharing agreement.\n\nFocusing on what matters to voters\n\nFairlie hopes the end of the deal will now provide an opportunity for the SNP to win over voters alienated by policies seen as tied to the Greens.\n\nHe said: \"We're going to get back to the issues that people want us to deal with. We're going to get back to growing the economy and eradicating poverty, dealing with our climate change targets.\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned, the divisive stuff, the culture wars, all of that kind of thing, we need to just get rid of it. Nothing good has come out of it and I think this is perfect opportunity to do that.\"\n\nSNP MP Chris Stephens said Swinney represents a good choice and an opportunity to move on.\n\nHe told us: \"We're on the doors campaigning three times a week.\n\n\"I think there was a feeling among some voters that we weren't dealing with the things that matter to people, like cost of living.\n\n\"I've been concentrating on cost of living, Stephen [Flynn] has been concentrating on cost of living, but it's not been cutting through because people watch what is going on up the road and we seem to be talking more about everything else but these issues.\n\n\"I think it's an opportunity for some focus.\"", "source": {"uri": "thecourier.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Courier"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Secretary_for_Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet Secretary for Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Flynn_(Scottish_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Flynn (Scottish politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bute_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bute House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sunday Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Fairlie_(MSP)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Fairlie (MSP)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Recognition_Reform_(Scotland)_Bill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perthshire_South_and_Kinross-shire_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perthshire South and Kinross-shire (Scottish Parliament constituency)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Party of England and Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_constituencies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom constituencies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Stephens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Stephens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Harvie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Harvie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2024/05/POLITICS_57474220-dxiytq68-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

The cherry on top for the normally ultra-cautious Labour leader was the party's surprise victory in the West Midlands mayoral election. Labour's Richard Parker took the mayor's job from Conservative candidate Andy Street by a majority of just 1,508 votes.\n\nIt was a real \"Were you up for Portillo moment\" though it happened on Saturday evening rather than in the wee small hours.\n\nKeeping Street in place in the West Midlands, and Lord Ben Houchen in Tees Valley, were among thee key tests that Rishi Sunak had to pass to quell talk of a revolt within his party. Losing Street means the Prime Minister is in for another difficult week, his only comfort being that there is no obvious candidate to replace him.\n\nMark Harper, the transport secretary, was the lucky minister sent out to tour the Sunday shows with a dual message from Number 10: yes the results were disappointing, but the plan is to stick to the plan. Clear enough?\n\nNot to Suella Braverman, who popped up on BBC1's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg. The former home secretary appeared more furious than disappointed, saying it was a \"disgrace\" for the Tories to be trailing Starmer, a man with \"the charisma of a peanut\".\n\nREAD MORE Swinney urged to overturn ban on wood burning stoves\n\nREAD MORE Who thinks he can deliver independence in 12 months?\n\nSubscribe here for more Scottish news\n\nYet she stopped short of saying Mr Sunak should go, saying a change of leader was not feasible before a general election. \"There is no superman or superwoman who can do it.\"\n\nIf Keir Starmer was scoring highly on the happiness index and Ms Braverman was bumping along the bottom, Scotland's politicians were somewhere in the middle.\n\nFirst along for BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show was John Swinney. Barring the last-minute appearance of a challenger, he will be back in the job of SNP leader and Scotland's First Minister this week.\n\nIf his relaxed manner is any guide, Mr Swinney has not had any sleepless nights since throwing his hat into the ring after Humza Yousaf's resignation.\n\nThe caption did not state where Mr Swinney was speaking from but it was not the spot he usually uses at home. Instead of a chair against a relatively plain background, he was on a sofa, complete with cosy checked throw, with photos and books in the background. Was this the new, chilled, fireside John Swinney we saw before us? His version of Tony Blair's sofa government?\n\nReferring to Kate Forbes as \"my colleague and friend\", he was positively chipper about the prospect of leading the party again. Not as chipper as Starmer with his election results, more \"content\" and ready to get going.\n\nThere was speculation at the weekend about the job he will offer Forbes, with Deputy First Minister, including a business/economy brief, mentioned in several papers. That would mean demoting or sacking the incumbent, Shona Robison. Would Mr Swinney really want to start a new term as leader with such a move?\n\nOther reports suggested he would cut the number of ministers from the current 26, and that a leaner cabinet would be focussed on a few key areas that matter most to the public. Whether this slimmer administration has a place for a minister for independence is another wait-and-see.\n\nMr Swinney expanded on what made him go for the leadership having stepped back from the front line when Nicola Sturgeon resigned as First Minister. What was different now, Geissler asked.\n\nMr Swinney said he was mindful that he had asked a lot of his family over the years. \"You know my personal circumstances, my wife has multiple sclerosis, I'm very heavily involved in supporting her as I should be, and want to be, as her husband.\n\n\"If I had stood last year I would have been going into office - and I probably would have won last year - pretty tired and pretty mentally and physically drained by 16 years in office. I've had a year out of frontline politics.\n\n\"I am physically and mentally rested, and my family are confident that we can manage our way through this if I become First Minister. \" Opposition parties lost no time last week in calling Swinney \"yesterday's man\", a line the Conservative MP Andrew Bowie returned to in his interview.\n\n\"He was last leader of the SNP when Bill Clinton was prime minister (sic), Bob the Builder was number one and I was 12-years-old,\" said Mr Bowie.\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said Mr Swinney's job would be managing the decline of the SNP, while Scottish Labour were in \"rebuilding mode\".\n\nThe exchanges were a hint that Scottish politics would remain just as lively with Swinney as First Minister. Perhaps not the right time, then, for the BBC to cut the number of hours of news it is required to broadcast in peak time on the BBC Scotland channel.\n\nThe question arises now that media regulator Ofcom has formally asked viewers for their responses to the plans set out earlier this year.\n\nOfcom said the plan was to replace The Nine and The Seven with a 30-minute news programme to be shown at 7pm. At the same time, Reporting Scotland would be extended from 30 minutes to an hour \"multiple times\" a year, Debate Night expanded, and a new podcast produced. There is no suggestion that The Sunday Show would be affected by the changes.\n\nIn its response, Ofcom noted that The Nine had lost viewers every year since 2020.\n\nIt also mentioned that the new news programme, in contrast to The Nine's focus on covering international, UK and national stories from a Scottish perspective, would aim to \"be more local and get around Scotland more\".\n\nOfcom's provisional view is that it will approve the BBC's request to cut the number of hours of peak time news required on the BBC Scotland channel. It is now seeking responses from \"interested or affected parties\".", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

There are also, however, myriad reasons why she perhaps shouldn't have agreed to be running in tandem with him.\n\nIf the ship were to go down, everyone on the bridge will sink too. There are precious few life rafts for losers.\n\nKate Forbes, for all the previous controversies attending her personal beliefs, would have been a clean skin. John self-evidently is not. He has been at the heart of his party since well before Kate was born, and with that kind of hinterland comes all manner of ammunition for his political opponents.\n\nVery few people in politics (or journalism) dislike John Swinney. And being generally likeable is an obvious asset. Yet it is not of itself enough without a healthy dollop of charisma, a gift for compelling oracy and an essential streak of ruthlessness.\n\nREAD MORE: Andrew Neil in furious outburst at The National over SNP cartoon\n\nI watched his leadership pitch twice, once live, once on YouTube. And I read the text with care. Anyone who thinks this was a barnstorming performance has yet to witness a barn being stormed.\n\nThere were heartfelt passages about feeling compelled to hurl his hat ringwards, even after calculating the sacrifices both he and his family were now signed up to. And there were passages about the necessity for economic growth which could have have been uttered by Ms Forbes. I doubt that was an accident.\n\nNeither accidental was his stated commitment to concentrate on the nation's health, education and transport given that these were the issues which preoccupied most voters.\n\nOne of the most interesting segments, however, was given relatively little attention. He talked about his first national council meeting where the party leadership was questioned and challenged.\n\nAnd he said: \"That is how it should be. And that's the culture I will encourage in the SNP I lead. It is by being open, willing to engage and happy to debate, that we bring people together.\n\n\"It is by giving people the space to speak their mind, and the respect their opinions deserve, that they are willing to come together and unify once a decision is made.\"\n\nAs we all know, that is not the culture which has recently obtained in the SNP, where dissent was confused with disloyalty and there was precious little in the way of space for free speech lest the speaker in question was monstered by the self-declared ideologically pure.\n\nWhich brings us to the role of the Greens, a party with no constituency MSPs or visible vote in the constituency ballots, but 8% in the regional variety. Which speaks of many Scots being prepared to give them their second vote.\n\nI used to be one such voter but got well and truly scunnered by their self-righteous pontification during the trans wars. Badges and jolly lanyards are really no substitute for careful research and a useful habit of not deploying the mouth before the brain is fully engaged.\n\nPerhaps they might care to reflect the numbers voting green were tiny compared with those supporting the SNP, the Tories and Labour. The LibDems with more than 324,000 votes in 2021, found themselves with four seats. The Greens, with 253,000, garnered eight.\n\nREAD MORE: New poll finds support for monarchy in Scotland falling rapidly\n\nSuch are the vagaries of our imperfect semi-proportional system; vastly preferable to first past the post, but hardly the fairest game in town. The trick with our PR variant is to figure out where to concentrate your troops to gain the best return. The Greens notched up 8% in Glasgow, for instance, yet less than 4% in the West as a whole.\n\nGiven all of which, the level of influence they managed to exert as the junior partners in the Bute House Agreement was, well, somewhat disproportionate. And at no point did they seem likely to engage with the thought that a safe space for disagreement, as proposed last Thursday by Mr Swinney, was actually the sign of a healthy body politic.\n\nWhen disgruntled Nationalists talked of the green tail wagging the yellow dog, you might suppose their irritation stemmed from the Government being hauled sideways up a number of blind alleyways so far as the Scottish public was concerned. The latter were keen to hear how their living conditions were likely to be improved, less likely to be pondering the possible effects of puberty blockers.\n\nYet even last Thursday, John body-swerved a question about trans women, perhaps forgetting that being disingenuous on that subject was what had derailed many political leaders. Or perhaps not!\n\nSo whither the SNP now? Mr Swinney insists he should not be regarded as a caretaker or interim leader. He says he intends to fight and win at both the next general and Holyrood elections.\n\nThere is not much time to beef up his offer for the first of these contests, given that it has to happen in a matter of months, maybe even weeks. He will need to fashion a credible Cabinet and give them the autonomy to play to their perceived strengths.\n\nWhen the late John Smith led his party, the English press, with their customary ignorance of Scottish politics and politicians, characterised him as a douce bank manager. His closer friends said, in contrast, that he could and did start a party in an empty room.\n\nMr Swinney, in turn, gives the impression of being a douce Church of Scotland elder, and he is in fact a committed Christian, which will doubtless oil some of the wheels in his dealings with the Free Kirk's Ms Forbes.\n\nHe will find it tricky to dismiss the impression of being a political retread, however, just as David Cameron's past life has come back to haunt him in his unlikely new incarnation as Rishi Sunak's Foreign Secretary. Though, in fairness, we can assume that Mr Swinney is unlikely ever to be accused of lobbying on behalf of dodgy financiers.\n\nI doubt that he is in the market for advice from a stray commentator, however committed to independence. Certainly not one sceptical of the wisdom of his returning to frontline politics.\n\nREAD MORE: Palestinian rector of Glasgow University denied entry into France\n\nFor what it's worth, I would train my fire on the fact that what seems certain to be an incoming Labour government has done more handbrake turns than Jeremy Clarkson in his petrolhead pomp.\n\nJust this last week, it seems the promises made by Angela Rayner anent zero-hour contracts and employees' rights have been the latest policy document heading for the shredder.\n\nAnd when queried about the Rwanda project and the backlog of asylum claims, I've yet to hear one Labour politician speak to the immorality of it all. Instead, they talk of wasted money, and how they will make more efficient use of the same funds.\n\nJust once, I want to hear a Labour leader remember that they are supposed to be the People's Party, and that the people concerned aren't those indulging in high-stakes gambling in hedge funds.\n\nI want to hear them extolling the virtues of compassion rather than Conserative-lite pronouncements on social policy. If I were a prospective Labour voter I'd be frankly outraged that the party chose to abstain on the Waspi women compensation vote.\n\nJohn Swinney at least put the twin scourges of childhood poverty and climate change at the top of his to-do list. It is said that the leader of \"Scottish\" Labour, Anas Sarwar, is not on the same page as the boss man on an assortment of policies, Gaza being the obvious example.\n\nIf he turns out to be little more than His Master's Voice on Scottish issues, he might find Scottish voters will be less than receptive on that ubiquitous doorstep.", "source": {"uri": "www-tmp.thenational.scot", "dataType":

Check over and having collected my personal items, a young woman appears at my side and says she'll take care of the tray. She says she hopes my day goes well and I glance up to see three of her colleagues smiling and nodding. It makes me feel, well ... sovereign.\n\nSpeak to any former MSP and they'll tell you that among their fondest memories of Holyrood are the parliamentary staff. \"They go above and beyond to help politicians and visitors alike,\" I've been told often.\n\nI've never been convinced that Edinburgh was the right place for our parliament. It should have been Glasgow. More than 40% of the entire population of Scotland lives within an hour of our largest and most vital city. Among them are a disproportionately high number of the country's most disadvantaged neighbourhoods. The people who live in these communities are affected most by the decisions taken here.\n\nTaking a day off work or away from the kids and shelling out 15 quid or so for a day return is not an option for these people. It's why most of the day-time demos you see outside Holyrood are enjoined by the middle-class radicals in the man-bun and red-corduroy brigade.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nMusic was in DNA of Scottish soul singer Christian\n\nWas Sangita Myska taken off the air over LBC Israeli argument?\n\nIt's here now though and you have to keep telling yourself you need to want the best for it and for those who work in it.\n\nI'm greeted warmly if a little warily by some of my brethren in His Majesty's press and media. McKay of STV and Boothman of The Times are in a huddle with Kerr of the BBC, all seeking to divine the portents of what will become a significant day in the life of the nation.\n\nJohn Swinney will declare his candidacy to be leader of the SNP and with it, First Minister of Scotland? Will it be a campaign launch or a coronation? Kate Forbes, strongly expected to run against him, is nowhere to be seen, but already the suggestion is that the pair have cut a deal.\n\nAnd so, we all embark on the 15-minute walk up to the premises of the Grassmarket Community Project to hear what Mr Swinney has to say. He's chosen his pitch well. This building is home to a suite of projects helping some of Edinburgh's most vulnerable groups.\n\nWithin minutes it's clear that we're here to witness the virtual swearing-in of our new First Minister. We fall to playing spot the cabinet secretaries. There's at least five of them in the first two rows with the SNP's Matalan Army of shiny-suited Millennials providing the whoops and hoping to catch the eye of their new circus-master.\n\nFiona Hyslop, long-serving stalwart of the SNP Government, approaches me. \"So, they're calling in the old dogs,\" she says. Then she apologises. \"I can't believe I just called you a dog.\"\n\n\"That's a hate crime,\" I say. But I've been called a lot worse. And Ms Hyslop, by general agreement, is regarded as one of the politest and most self-effacing politicians in the business. I'll get over it.\n\nMr Swinney's speech is mostly what you might have expected. The Tories are getting it tight after three minutes and I begin to conduct my own lottery on when the baby box and the child payment will feature. 'Cohesive' occurs often, as does 'change'. Mr Swinney says he \"cared too much to walk on by\" and The Stranglers start playing in my head.\n\nAnd then, unbidden, a small incendiary as he talked about Kate Forbes, his \"colleague and friend\" who was \"an intelligent, creative, thoughtful person who has much to contribute to our national life\". And, \"if elected, I will make sure Kate is able to make that contribution\". The fix is in and this is confirmed by Ms Forbes' warm response three hours later.\n\nVisitors to the World Press Photo exhibition view the entries at the launch of the exhibition in the Scottish Parliament, on July 31, 2019 in Edinburgh (Image: free)\n\nShow over, the Matalans are now holding up their wee John Swinney cards in the manner of a primary school anti-litter campaign. Bless them.\n\nBack at Holyrood, my colleague, Ms Kathleen Nutt of The Herald, who's been tasked with guiding me through the concealed avenues and alleyways of this building, makes a sage observation. \"There were about half a dozen cab secs there,\" she said. \"But he only had praise for Kate Forbes.\"\n\nThe John and Kate show overshadows what had been my principal purpose: attending what will turn out to be Humza Yousaf's last ever First Minister's Questions. The public galleries are full, including two school parties. And though the day's main excursions and alarums are unfolding elsewhere, the chamber is almost full: a mark of respect perhaps for Mr Yousaf, whose life has just been put through the wringer.\n\nHe rises to the occasion, conducting himself with dignity and some style and eschewing recrimination in the face of Tory goading. At one point he references future arrangements with the Scottish Greens who were the architects of his very public fall. \"That will be for my successor to decide on a case by case basis,\" he says. You form the impression that he simply wasn't cut out for this and is relieved it's over.\n\nYour heart goes out to him, a little. He is still a young man and, in the course of the day, it becomes clear that when he sought out a helping hand from within his own party it was returned swathed in grease.\n\nIn the restaurant I see Ash Regan and her Alba team and join them with a plate of the green stuff everything else seems to be having. My five-a-week reached in one sitting. They're keen to quash last weekend's reports that Alex Salmond had authored their written offer to Humza Yousaf for a deal that might have saved him. \"It was written over on that table behind the pillar over plates of Mac and cheese,\" I'm told.\n\nThroughout the afternoon I solicit the names of the men (and women) in grey kilts who intervened to stop Mr Yousaf making any deal with Alba. The main players would appear on most people's top-five lists and there's speculation about Nicola Sturgeon's role in the drama.\n\nIn the Garden Lobby where the journalists gather to meet the MSPs before divvying up the proceeds, John Swinney appears. He pops over, hand outstretched and I'm hoping pathetically he hadn't seen my very short video with Ms Nutt being disobliging of that morning's speech.\n\nOur paths have crossed several times in the course of the last 20 years and he is, as usual, unfailingly courteous and even affectionate. He's an operator though. \"So, what's it to be, John,\" I say. \"Is it Kate as your deputy as well as the finance brief? Just for background, you understand.\" He's saying nothing of course, but conveys once more his high regard for Ms Forbes.\n\nWe're fond of the phrase 'political bubble' to describe the little community that gathers here each day. Holyrood though, is much more than that. It's a statelet, like a secular Vatican with its own system of governance, traditions, rules and disciplinary system.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nOBITUARY: 'King of clubs' had so many tales of Glasgow's most famous rock acts\n\nREVIEW: Big Banana Feet was Billy Connolly at his funniest and fearless best\n\nAt Westminster, with its 635 MPs, vendettas and enmities can be absorbed easily. Not so in Holyrood where there are only 129 of them and where, in the course of a five-year term, they're expected to work with their political foes across dozens of committees. Compromise and rectitude are baked into the machinery of this place.\n\nOn Thursday, it seemed that the SNP had had a good day. The Swinney/Forbes concordat means the party can work towards the 2026 Scottish election without being convulsed by the gender wars that Nicola Sturgeon orchestrated and which Humza Yousaf failed to quell. Yet on Scottish Political Twitter it was glorious carnage. Absolutely everyone was getting machine-gunned.\n\nJust a few days ago, the Scottish Greens were portraying themselves as the organ grinder behind the SNP monkey. In reality, though, they've lost everything. They're no longer in government; their magical ministries have evaporated and Kate Forbes, their No1 enemy, will soon wield more influence on the affairs of state than they ever had.\n\nOn the Canongate side of the Scottish Parliament, the words from Psalm 19:14 are carved into the stonework. \"Let the words of thy mouth, and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength and my redeemer.\"\n\nIt seems that, after all, Holyrood is a place where faith and politics can work well together. It's written in the foundations.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

You can watch, and read, it in full below.\n\nA year ago, even a week ago, I did not think my future would involve standing here accepting the Leadership of the Scottish National Party.\n\nThings have turned out differently and before I say any more about my leadership I want to pay tribute to Humza Yousaf.\n\nHe has conducted himself throughout the last year with grace and dignity in some acutely difficult circumstances.\n\nIn particular, his moral leadership on the issue of Gaza has been a light in very dark times.\n\nOur party must continue and will continue to be a light.\n\nWe must continue to illuminate hope, fight for international justice and be willing to stand up for what we believe to be right.\n\nThat is what Humza Yousaf did. I know that Humza will continue to make a substantial contribution to the public life of Scotland and I thank him for all that he has done as our Party Leader and First Minister.\n\nToday is the beginning of a new chapter in our party's history - a chapter that will be about coming together, uniting and dedicating ourselves to the service of Scotland.\n\nI want to express my heartfelt thanks to the many Party members, and the many Elected Members, at Westminster and Holyrood, and in our Councils, for their encouragement to me to stand for the Party leadership.\n\nMy decision to stand is not borne out of long-held ambition, but rather a profound sense of duty to my Party and my country.\n\nI know there is controversy for some that I am the only candidate to stand for the leadership.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly I take a different view. For me, the fact that I am the only candidate demonstrates the Scottish National Party is now coming back together again.\n\nI promised I would create an inclusive and unified team. And I will do that.\n\nI promised I would enable open and respectful dialogue in the SNP. And I will do that.\n\nI promised to make sure the SNP looks outward to the people of our country and not inward amongst ourselves. And I will do that.\n\nI have had the privilege of contributing a significant amount to the SNP story.\n\nIn that time, I have seen the lows and the highs of our modern political history as a Party. And, over those highs and lows, one thing has been clear time after time:\n\nScotland wins when the SNP wins.\n\nYes, we have faced a rough time recently as a Party. But remember what has been happening during that rough time.\n\nThe Scottish child payment is lifting 100,000 children out of poverty.\n\nFree University tuition opens a better future to record numbers of young people from poorer backgrounds.\n\nAnd, the massive expansion of child care is giving children from every background a better start in life.\n\nSo however tough it has been recently for the SNP, never ever forget that at the same time, SNP policies and actions are transforming lives here and now in our country.\n\nAs I begin my leadership of the party I love, I want to speak not just to everyone here at this SNP gathering.\n\nI want to speak to each and every person in this country.\n\nTo those who know me and those who don't.\n\nTo those who support the SNP and those who never have.\n\nAnd, to those who support independence and those we are yet to convince.\n\nI want to set out the vision I have of our nation's future.\n\nI said when I launched my candidacy for leadership that I wanted to create a modern, diverse, dynamic Scotland.\n\nToday I am standing in a building that speaks of that future.\n\nIt is the Advanced Research Centre of the University of Glasgow.\n\nHere in the heart of one of the oldest universities in Europe, research into the newest, leading edge technologies push back the boundaries of what is possible.\n\nExperience and innovation combined.\n\nHistory and modernity together, forging a new future.\n\nThat is the perfect vision for Scotland.\n\nA country with a depth of history, can blend the old and the new and forge the best future for herself.\n\nA country where people have good jobs, the climate is protected, the vulnerable are lifted up and opportunity is available to all.\n\nThat is the new chapter I offer.\n\nOne built on experience.\n\nOn skills honed over decades.\n\nEvery moment of my journey devoted to building the new Scotland I believe is possible.\n\nLater this week, Scotland will choose a new First Minister.\n\nIn putting my name forward, it is important that I set out what kind of First Minister I will be.\n\nI spoke last week about unifying our party and about what we can do for Scotland together.\n\nI believe the same is true of our Parliament.\n\nIn 2021, the share of the vote commanded by Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats all fell.\n\nThe SNP recorded our best ever share of the constituency vote.\n\nIn fact, we won more votes and a higher share of the votes in the constituency ballot than any party in the 25 year history of devolution.\n\nThat is our mandate but it does not give us a monopoly on good ideas.\n\nIt means that we have the right - in fact, the duty - to form the government. But it does not mean we can stop listening to people and voices outside our party.\n\nThe polarisation of politics does not serve our country well.\n\nToo often, too many people are too busy fighting to win battles when we should be seeking solutions to problems.\n\nThat is what I pledge I will seek to do.\n\nI will reach out to everyone willing to join with us in good faith and seek compromises that serve our nation well.\n\nThat does not mean debate will end - far from it - but it does mean that, should I be elected, I will first seek to find common ground, to join together in coalitions of the willing and solve the problems our country faces.\n\nWe need to stop shouting at each other and talk.\n\nMore than that, actually, we need to listen.\n\nAnd as First Minister, I will do exactly that.\n\nAnd Friends, I believe recent events show that this approach works.\n\nLast week I met with Kate Forbes. We came together and discussed the shared ambitions we have for our country and how best to go forward. I welcome Kate's support for my leadership.\n\nAnd over the weekend, I reached out to my party colleague Graeme McCormick.\n\nHe wanted to stand for election so he could be heard. So I listened and assured him the views of party members up and down the country will be properly listened to.\n\nThe simple lesson is that dialogue can bring us to points of agreement and strength.\n\nAnd that is my message today to every party in the Scottish Parliament. Focus on solutions to problems and you will find no one more willing to listen than me.\n\nTogether we can make a real difference to the lives of people in Scotland. That is the job we have all been sent to Parliament to do.\n\nOf course, I believe that this country could do more if we had the powers of a normal independent nation - the powers of independence. The cost of living crisis and the damaging impact of Brexit are two examples of Westminster decisions that are bad for Scotland. They demonstrate why Scotland needs to have Independence to make our own decisions and create our best future.\n\nI will always seek, with respect and courtesy, to persuade people of the case for Independence.\n\nAll I ask of those who oppose that vision is they also act with the same courtesy and respect.\n\nThat means Independence is not a reason for them to refuse to work with us to build the economy, support jobs and improve the health service.\n\nIf elected First Minister, my focus will be the economy, jobs, the cost of living. It will be the NHS, our schools and our public services. It will be addressing the climate crisis.\n\nSo to everyone in every party, to every MSP, to every MP. In fact, to everyone in our great country, I say this:\n\nJoin me.\n\nDo not let our disagreements dominate.\n\nJoin me as we open a new chapter.\n\nAs we create a vibrant economy in every part of our country.\n\nAs we tackle the challenges faced by the NHS.\n\nAs we build on the strengths of our schools.\n\nAs we build more homes.\n\nTake climate action.\n\nImprove public transport.\n\nAnd create jobs.\n\nThat's my job, that's our job.\n\nAnd I plan to get the job done.\n\nThank you.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [],

They were autocratic and intolerant'", "body": "The politician explains how her former party went toxic - and why her views on Christianity and gender were 'barely tolerated'\n\nClever, principled, and relatable, Dr Lisa Cameron is exactly the kind of person our political system needs. Which is why her horrific tale of the bullying and abuse she suffered inside the Scottish National Party - which culminated in her defection to the Conservatives last October - is such a tragedy.\n\nOver the past few weeks, the wider world has begun to understand the toxic \"progressive orthodoxy\" and political chaos that has been raging inside the SNP. This week its hapless leader Humza Yousaf finally stood down after a chaotic few days of coalition collapse and political turmoil, while just a fortnight ago, former leader Nicola Sturgeon's husband was formally charged with embezzlement of party funds.\n\nMeanwhile, Scottish public services are in disarray and the SNP's policy of putting up taxes on higher earners has already caused 1,000 individuals and businesses to relocate to England. It is hard to believe that it is less than 10 years since the SNP was riding high on a wave of nationalism which swept away a generation of Labour MPs. Or that Nicola Sturgeon was once seen as the epitome of the modern leader.\n\nIn her parliamentary office with its views out over grey spring skies and Big Ben, Dr Cameron shakes her head: \"Nationalism is not the answer. It's just made everything worse. It's not been good for Scotland. It's ushered in an era of aggressive, us-and-them politics, eroding compassion and creating polarisation.\"\n\nSo how did we get here? Cameron, 51, says that when she joined the Scottish National Party in 2014 she was enthused and convinced by Alex Salmond's vision of a better future. \"As a senior NHS psychologist I was in favour of the SNP's policies of more money for the NHS, free prescriptions for the Scottish people and particularly free university tuition. It all sounded good but it hasn't delivered. Education is very important for people like me.\"\n\nBorn in Westwood, East Kilbride, Cameron's mother worked as a secretary for Rolls Royce, while the man she calls \"dad\" (her biological father left for the US when she was a baby) drove a taxi.\n\n\"My mum and my grandmother were working-class Conservatives. Thanks to Maggie Thatcher we were able to buy our council house. My mother was so proud of that. My family was all about working hard, striving, aspiring to give your kids a better future.\" Cameron is proud to have been the first person in her family to go to university - \"I was always taught that education was the key; the aspirational route to a better life. My mum wanted me to be either a lawyer or a doctor.\"\n\nAt Strathclyde University, Cameron studied psychology because she was \"fascinated by people's behaviour, I wanted to help them change and be rehabilitated\". When she became Dr Cameron after taking a doctorate in Glasgow, her family were thrilled. As a consultant forensic psychologist, Cameron worked at Carstairs psychiatric hospital, Scotland's equivalent of Broadmoor, and became an assessor for the Scottish Risk Management Authority, one of only 20 people in the country permitted to decide whether \"the most dangerous criminals who had been imprisoned for life could be released into the community\". In 2009, she married Mark Horsham, an army veteran from the Regiment of Mechanical Engineers who had served in Bosnia and suffered a head injury.\n\nIn 2015, when her younger daughter Charlotte was only 18 months old, Cameron decided to stand for the SNP in the safe Labour seat of East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow. \"No one expected me to win, I was meant to be a paper candidate. When I did win it was a bit of a shock. I'd never been to the House of Commons.\"\n\nCameron was not the only SNP candidate shocked to find themselves in Westminster in 2015; it was a landslide for the nationalists who won 56 Scottish seats in the House of Commons out of 59. Labour was wiped out. This week's local elections point to a similar outcome in reverse at the next election with SNP losses to Labour likely to play a key part in helping Keir Starmer's party to victory.\n\n\"The SNP experiment has failed. I see a clear move from nationalism and constitutional politics back to the old politics of Left and Right. I keep being asked by constituents: 'How do we move on from the SNP? It hasn't worked.' Scotland is turning the page on nationalism.\"\n\nShe is quietly withering about the SNPs future, post Humza Yousaf. \"It feels like there will be a coronation. John Swinney will get it, but talk about going back to the future. He is yesterday's leader.\" Swinney was SNP chief 20 years ago, pre Salmond and Sturgeon.\n\nUnlike many career politicians who go straight from university to working as parliamentary researchers, Cameron never set out to be a politician. \"I went to the kind of school where if I had said I wanted to be the local MP I'd have been firmly told that that job is not for the likes of me.\"\n\nWhen we meet in her parliamentary office, Cameron is friendly and soft-spoken. On her desk are pictures of her two daughters, Charlotte, 10, and Olivia, 15, both blonde like her and crazy about horses. When she was first elected she used to bring Charlotte, then a baby, with her to London during the week and leave her in the parliamentary creche. But it wasn't practical. \"The creche finishes at 6pm ... while votes go on into the night and my husband and my mum were both hundreds of miles away.\"\n\nThe strain of being a young mother and an MP was hard. But far worse was to come. Cameron's troubles began in 2019 when she \"voted on my conscience\" at the end of an abortion debate (she was a vice-chairman on the pro-Life All-Party Parliamentary Group so this shouldn't have been a surprise to her colleagues).\n\n\"I was brought up a Christian by my granny. I went to Sunday school, my faith is important to me. Particularly at difficult times it gives you reasons for things, the church has grounded me and given me support.\" As she speaks she plays with her necklace of white and gold Christian crosses.\n\n\"Also I had two miscarriages, they were painful and upsetting, traumatic.... that and my faith influenced my views on abortion.\n\n\"Christians are barely tolerated in the SNP. I was told my views meant that I would fail its vetting. That I shouldn't be in the SNP because I wasn't progressive enough. I was bullied because of my faith.\"\n\nThis is something Kate Forbes, who was considering running for the leadership until supporting John Swinney - and is a Christian - also discovered.\n\nCameron has come under fire for defecting to the Conservatives with SNP members saying she should have stood down rather than switched. She will not be standing for re-election in her constituency next time.\n\nShe explains that the SNP that she joined under Alex Salmond was a \"broad church, more tolerant\", and that the culture war-style \"uber progressive politics came in after Alex Salmond left. Under Nicola Sturgeon, the party's leftist politics became toxic. It was Nicola Sturgeon who said she 'hated' the Tories.\n\n\"That was a big moment for me, that meant Sturgeon hated my mum. That was not the Scotland I had joined the SNP to build.\" Cameron felt her card was marked.\n\nWhen she was badly stalked in 2021 - she had to go to court - she says, \"Sturgeon never reached out to see if I was OK. No one from the SNP ever personally congratulated me on my work on disabilities, for which I won MP of the year.\" Cameron was officially persona non grata.\n\nPrior to this, in 2019, Cameron's local SNP branch passed a motion which criticised the decision to \"impose Dr Lisa Cameron as the party's candidate in the forthcoming General Election for the second time\". Despite this she was reselected and won the seat. In the same year, Cameron further riled the party hierarchy when she stood up for the young male victim of sexual advances by a leading SNP figure Patrick Grady (Grady was found guilty and eventually suspended briefly).\n\n\"I was the only person in the party to support the victim. I thought he had been really brave to come forward, he was very young. In the meeting the groupthink was that we should all 'support the perpetrator'. I said, 'what about the victim, we should support him'. I'm a doctor and a psychologist. I did what I thought was right.\" She paid a high price. \"I was ostracised in the tea room where none of my SNP colleagues would speak to me. They emailed me saying I had to move office. They sent boxes. I refused to move so they put the perpetrator in the office next to mine where I had to walk past him every day. It was awful. I felt I couldn't cope.\"\n\nDid she feel this was done deliberately? \"As a psychologist assessing dangerous criminals you don't listen to what people say - you watch what they do. Let's just say it would be a strange coincidence that they just put him there.\"\n\nShe says in those dark days when she was almost incapacitated with anxiety and stress, she was saved by the kindness of MPs from other parties whom she knew through her work on disabilities, animal rights (she launched the Lucy's Law campaign in the House of Commons against puppy farming in 2019) as well as serving on numerous parliamentary committees.\n\n\"Tories, Lib Dems, Rosie Duffield from Labour, they were so kind to me, they didn't like to see me being bullied, they could all see what was going on that I was being ostracised. Being in the SNP was deleterious to my mental health. I went from being a senior respected psychologist to being a patient just because I did what I thought was right.\"\n\nWorse, she says, was that she told the SNP chief whip and many other party dignitaries about the state she was in and \"no one was helpful. I sent emails to the different chief whips saying I needed support for my health. They had a duty of care, but they ignored me. I was anxious, depressed, having panic attacks.\" Instead, she says, they \"gaslighted me, told me I was making it up\". Today she still feels so upset about their treatment of her that she shows me the notes from the wellbeing counsellor who treated her in the House of Commons.\n\n\"I want the world to know that I am telling the truth. Senior SNP figures are still trying to deny it. I even took pictures of my boxes of antidepressants because I felt so gaslit.\"\n\nI researched what senior SNP figures said about her. After her defection to the Tories, Mike Russell, president of the SNP at the time, characterised her claims of toxicity and maltreatment by the party as \"a rather odd tantrum from somebody who was going to lose their seat and their nomination... that kind of ego driven politics is deeply unattractive\".\n\nCameron frowns. \"They were just constantly trying to undermine me, that's why I have to vindicate myself.\"\n\nI also read through the weekly notes written by her counsellor. One note read: \"Lisa and I spoke about how it feels to be on the Estate [inside Westminster] at the moment and how she is still avoiding places and people over concerns of what they might say to her. She feels like she is being treated like the perpetrator should be treated, while the perpetrator is being treated as if nothing happened.\"\n\nAnother said: \"Lisa reflected on how her beliefs and priorities have not been respected ... she talked about how her mental health challenges have not been 'recognised' by her party and how she felt unsupported and ostracised by doing what she thought was the right thing.\"\n\nOver the months of the sessions a pattern is clear, with another stating: \"Lisa spoke about her anxiety, losing sleep as she lies awake worrying, not being able to stop checking her phone even in a yoga class.\"\n\nIt is clear to me that Cameron is telling the truth. As she shares her notes, her voice becomes timorous, tears fill her eyes. Whatever you think of her political beliefs, it is clear this brave, competent woman has been through hell at the hands of her SNP colleagues. \"There was no support for me from within the party. I was shunned.\" It sounds like Mean Girls, I say. She nods. \"Yup, pretty much.\"\n\nOf course, at the centre of the SNP culture wars is the ongoing row around the Gender Recognition Bill, particularly around whether trans-women should be imprisoned in female jails. Particularly those, such as Scottish transgender woman Isla Bryson, who had committed rape as a man.\n\n\"This was something that I am an expert on,\" Cameron says. \"I'd done risk assessments in prisons as part of my job. Many female prisoners have a history of sexual abuse and trauma. Lots of women in my constituency wrote to me saying it was very important that rapists who'd raped women shouldn't be in enclosed spaces, ie, locked up with women. My opinion on this matter was never sought by the SNP. They just took the view that this was the policy... accept it. This is the ideology.\"\n\nI ask whether, during her time as a psychologist, assessing risk like this was an issue. \"I worked with people who were transitioning. I know that there needs to be a bespoke response to their needs. That a male prison might be wrong for them too. But no one could raise any concerns. The SNP view just became narrower and narrower. Anyone who disagreed was ostracised. It became a huge issue. Joanna Cherry also got lots of abuse and so did Kate Forbes.\"\n\nIt wasn't just on the uber progressive agenda that any criticisms were shut down.\n\n\"There were concerns within the party about the finances. The treasurer Douglas Chapman complained and later resigned claiming he was not given proper access to the information.\"\n\nShe adds: \"Then when Humza Yousaf was running for leader it got even worse. The SNP rounded on Kate Forbes during the leadership race saying she wasn't suitable because of her beliefs. That was not the tolerant Scotland I grew up in. But the leadership thought they were right on everything. It got very autocratic and intolerant. It was, 'Don't question anything. Don't disagree. If you disagree: shut up!' There was no care for victims. The whole ethos of nationalism was exhausting.\"\n\nI look around her office at the touching reminders of a parallel reality - two teddy bears, a spare pair of shoes, a smart dress hanging on the back of the door. A Brompton bicycle for the commute. It is hard to reconcile those bits of normality with the darkness she has been through. \"When I left the SNP it got worse. There were terrifying threats from the CyberNats. They said I should be 'bricked' and 'burned'. I got death threats, I had to move to a safe house. Challenging nationalism is a cardinal sin for some people.\"\n\nIntriguingly she says the first senior politician to show her any sympathy or compassion was Rishi Sunak. \"His office reached out to me to say I was doing wonderful work on the disabled and mental health. The first time I have felt supported in politics by a party was when I joined the Tories. Rishi is a family man, we talked about our girls who are about the same age. He has worked hard and accomplished a lot. He means it when he says he wants to restore compassion and integrity to politics.\"\n\nHave they got their kids together yet for a play date? \"Not yet!\"\n\nI say given the Conservative party's unpopularity at the moment some might find her delight in the Tory embrace ironic. She shakes her head. \"The Tory party really is a broad church. They are pro-Christian; they respect different views.\"\n\nThere has been talk that she is on a promise of a seat in the House of Lords because of the defection. \"No, that's not true. I've been thinking of leaving politics, going back into the NHS is always a possibility for me. But I am passionate about disability work. I won't be standing in my seat at the next election - politics in Scotland is very toxic. \" I say I think she would be excellent at running a big charity or campaigning organisation. She smiles. \"Yes, I'd like that.\"\n\nIf she had known what the future had in store for her when she became a politician back in 2015, would she still have done it? There is a long pause. \"I believe in compassionate politics. I have seen how hard it is to be an MP with young kids, or as a woman or if you have a disability. I fear the abuse people get. It doesn't encourage the right kind of people to come into politics. If you are a doctor you don't go into parliament for money. But I do feel proud of what I have done for veterans and the disabled and on mental health. I feel personally that I have come full circle, that I have survived and struggled through it. I got off the antidepressants. I no longer see the counsellor. I am happy now.\"\n\nShe points to the picture of her daughter Olivia. \"One mark of the change is that my daughter knows that if she wants to be an MP she can be. We've cracked that glass ceiling. That is progress.\"", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eleanor_mills@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Eleanor Mills", "type":

Manage that and you're in.\n\nGiven that the leader is technically re-elected every year, it wouldn't take much for a determined activist - and the SNP has many determined activists - to have a go at it.\n\nWe saw one such activist this weekend. Graeme McCormick had the nominations to trigger a leadership contest, but pulled out after a \"lengthy and fruitful\" discussion with John Swinney.\n\nI don't think he ever thought he would win, but I admire his enthusiasm.\n\nActivist Graeme McCormick almost triggered an SNP leadership race until he withdrew (Image: Newsquest)\n\nOne of the SNP's problems is that it has never quite caught up with itself. Many of its rules and standing orders seem to date back to when it was more of a niche concern, not the behemoth it became after the 2014 referendum.\n\nAlthough it may not have the 125,000 members of its peak in 2019, it is still a massive movement with the most recently available figures showing around 69,000 members in December.\n\nThat means the threshold of support for entering the leadership contest is equivalent to winning the support of just 0.14% of the party's membership.\n\nThere is something quite nice about the fact that you don't need the support of any parliamentarians.\n\nBy way of comparison, to enter the last Labour leadership contest you needed to be nominated by 20% of Labour MPs, 5% of constituency parties and at least three affiliates.\n\nUnspun | There may not be a leadership race, but can Swinney finish the independence marathon?\n\nIn its interim report last June, the governance review announced by Humza Yousaf said there needed to be \"new rules for any leadership contest\" and that anyone challenging for the leadership should need to be \"supported by a sufficiently high proportion of the membership and elected parliamentarians\".\n\nWhich is a bit of shame, but understandable given that leadership contests cost the party between \u00a3160,000 and \u00a3180,000.\n\nBut as the SNP leadership crisis calms down, the Tory leadership crisis is ramping up.\n\nUnspun | Neil Mackay: Swinney wanted election with Tory leader change. He should call one.\n\nDespite the disaster of last Thursday's local election that cost his party nearly 500 council seats, and the West Midlands mayoralty, and the historic defeat at the Blackpool South by-election, Rishi Sunak is clinging on.\n\nHe is clinging on even though he has accepted that his party is on course to lose the general election.\n\nLast night he told the Times that Thursday's results suggest the country is \"heading for a hung parliament\".\n\nHe said a Keir Starmer government would be \"propped up in Downing Street by the SNP, Liberal Democrats and the Greens\".\n\nIt sounds very similar to David Cameron's \"coalition of chaos\" claim from the 2015 election. You'll remember the billboards with Ed Miliband in Alex Salmond and then Nicola Sturgeon's pocket.\n\nIs the result really going to be that close?\n\nThe claim is based on analysis by Michael Thrasher, Professor of Politics at the University of Plymouth and regular Sky News pundit.\n\nIt's based on Labour's share of the vote on Thursday, which Prof Thrasher said could leave Sir Keir 32 seats of a majority and forced to rely on the SNP, the Lib Dems and others.\n\nGet Scotland's top politics newsletter straight to your inbox.\n\nHowever, the big assumption - and it's a massive assumption - in his analysis is that the vote in Scotland and Wales will remain where it was at the 2019 election.\n\nThat's why Professor Sir John Curtice called the claims unreliable. He knows this because he came up with a similar projection based on last week's election.\n\n\"We did feel maybe it wasn't necessarily the most reliable piece of information,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\nHe also pointed out that the way people vote in local elections \"doesn't necessarily exactly mirror the way that they would vote in a general election\".\n\nProf Curtice also pointed out that Reform UK stood in only one in six council seats.\n\nIt's not that a hung parliament is not possible, it's just that Graeme McCormick probably had more chance of becoming SNP leader.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Pat and I are old university buddies from the University of Edinburgh a lifetime ago. So I don't think Pat's public line to you is something he would sustain in a decent conversation with me or with others.\"\n\nMr Swinney's remarks come as Labour and the SNP fight over seats which before the 2014 independence referendum were safe Labour heartlands in Scotland.\n\nThe allegations against Nicola Sturgeon and collapse of Mr Yousaf's government have buoyed Labour hopes that they can make serious gains north of the Border. However, there has been an ongoing debate over whether Labour should be less Unionist and more sympathetic to asking for another independence referendum again.\n\nBut the prospect of a Labour/ SNP deal appears to be strengthened by expert claims that the UK is heading for a hung parliament after the general election.\n\nPolling expert Professor Michael Thrasher warned that Labour will fall short of an overall majority even though the local elections \"confirm that the Conservatives are in a very bad place.\"\n\nHe said: \"The Conservatives are on track to lose the election [but] it is not wholly clear to me Labour is on course to win a majority.\"\n\nHe noted that the vote share for Labour was 34 percent while the Tories were at 27 percent, a difference of seven points which is much lower tha the national polls suggest. The projection has suggested that Labour would be 32 seats short of a majoriy which means they would need to make a deal with other parties.\n\nHe noted: \"The only thing that [the Conservatives] can hang on to is that Labour's performance wasn't stellar. They went backwards compared t last year.\"\n\nProf Thrasher added: \"The gap is only seven points, it needs to be double that for Labour to win.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "1970 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_McFadden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pat McFadden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hung parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_wall_(British_politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red wall (British politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Conservative_Party_leadership_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2019 Conservative Party leadership election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Scottish_independence_referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2014 Scottish independence referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_second_Scottish_independence_referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proposed second Scottish independence referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/04/23/b8be4f670f86432170f50acfcd7522eaY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE0OTQ1ODM3-2.76070750.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

focus would be on the \"economy, jobs, health, schools, and public services.\"\n\nAsked by the Glasgow Times if he could achieve those aims without increasing the funding available to local authorities, he said the reason councils were facing budget pressures was UK imposed austerity.\n\nGlasgow City Council faces \u00a3107m cuts over three years, with an estimated 450 teaching jobs and 150 social work jobs at risk.\n\nMeanwhile, a senior councillor said the council doesn't have enough cash to fill in all the potholes.\n\nREAD NEXT:Councillor reveals solution to fixing potholes in

finance s of every area of government.\n\n\"That is because we have been subjected to 14 years of austerity from the United Kingdom Government.\"\n\nHe said tax changes in Scotland meant there was \u00a31bn cash for councils than there would otherwise have been.\n\nSwinney said: \"So, we've recognised the need to invest in public services, that's enabled us to give more money to local authorities than we ordinarily would have been able to give had we not taken those decisions.\n\n\"But the underlying problem is austerity from the Tory government in Westminster and I'm not optimistic that the parameters of that austerity are going to change much if there's the election of a Labour government sometime later on this year.\"\n\nHe said a visitor levy Bill if passed will increase cash available to councils.\n\nHe added: \"We've got to work effectively with our local authorities and we will do that to create ways in which local authorities are able to maximise their resources.\"\n\nThe First Minister-in-waiting set out what people can expect from a John Swinney SNP government.\n\nHe said: \"I will lead a government from the centre-left position of Scottish politics, the moderate centre-left, that's where I come from.\"\n\nSwinney began his speech by paying tribute to Humza Yousaf, stating: \"He has conducted himself throughout the last year with grace and with dignity in some acutely difficult circumstances.\"\n\nHe highlighted Yousaf's \"moral leadership on the issue of Gaza,\" describing it as \"a light in these dark times.\"\n\nWhen questioned about the SNP's future relationship with the Scottish Greens and the current policy agenda between the parties, he replied: \"I'm sure there will be a lot of common ground between ourselves and the

Nor have I hidden the fact that the last year as a backbench MSP has been one of the most rewarding of my almost 27 years as a parliamentarian.\n\nSo my decision to stand to lead both my party and my country was not one borne out of long-held ambition, but rather a profound sense of duty.\n\nI have been very clear that the Scottish National Party is in a difficult place at the moment. It is inevitable that during a hugely successful and lengthy period in government, there will be challenging spells. When these moments arrive, it is vital that you face up to them head-on and prove to the public that you are still worthy of their support and trust.\n\nREAD MORE: Humza Yousaf congratulates Sadiq Khan on London mayor election win\n\nAnd that is why I have offered to work to unite the SNP as leader of the party. Because our party is at its strongest when we are pulling together in the same direction and continuing our proud tradition of delivering for the people of Scotland.\n\nI believe that I am the person best-placed to bring the SNP together, re-focus our priorities and deliver the serious, steady government that the people of Scotland deserve, and that has been so lacking from Westminster.\n\nI also have unique experience of governing as a minority party. I vividly remember being told time and time again during my first year as finance secretary, with the SNP holding just 47 out of 129 seats, that I would be unable to persuade Parliament to pass a budget. To be fair to the doubters, they were ultimately proved correct. I didn't get one Budget passed - I managed to get parliamentary support for 10 of them.\n\nSince coming to power in 2007, the SNP have delivered profound and life-transforming policies that have improved the lives and prospects of millions of Scots.\n\nThe Scottish Child Payment, which has lifted 100,000 children out of poverty. The massive expansion of early learning and childcare, saving families thousands of pounds a year. Free university tuition, meaning that no Scottish child will be deprived the opportunity to pursue their academic dreams because of their economic circumstances.\n\nI am immensely proud of what we have achieved, and I will defend my party's record in government to the hilt. But I recognise that more needs to be done.\n\nThat is why, if elected, I will ensure that my government works tirelessly in the pursuit of social justice and economic growth.\n\nTo achieve this, I will draw from the considerable talent that my party is lucky enough to possess and put together a Cabinet that reflects the diversity and strength of the SNP.\n\nThis Cabinet will be a place for open and respectful debate, where ideas are scrutinised, challenged and tested.\n\nOne person who will play a key role in this is my friend and colleague, Kate Forbes. Kate is one of the brightest talents in Scottish politics and I am therefore delighted that she has supported my candidacy. She is an asset to Scottish public life and will be an asset to my government.\n\nREAD MORE: New poll finds support for monarchy in Scotland falling rapidly\n\nWith a united, dynamic and laser-focused team by my side, I am confident that the SNP can effectively articulate the case for independence and demonstrate the benefits that it would bring to households across the country.\n\nFor all of my adult life, I have believed in and campaigned for independence. When independence was a niche view in the 1980s, I was pounding the pavements and knocking on doors to advance the cause. Winning hearts and minds, one person at a time.\n\nMy commitment to this cause is unwavering. It is a source of great pride that, since joining the party, the idea of independence has moved from the political fringes to now being supported by approximately half the country.\n\nIf we are to achieve independence, though, we must make the case to those who have yet to be convinced. That is why I will advance the arguments for independence in a respectful manner that seeks to address the concerns of those who have yet to be won over to the cause. It is only by ensuring that support for independence is consistently at a greater level than it is now that we can achieve this long-held goal.\n\nSo my leadership pitch is crisp and simple: if elected leader, I will unite the SNP and work towards building a stronger Scotland, a fairer Scotland and an independent Scotland.", "source": {"uri": "www-tmp.thenational.scot", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Scottish_National_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backbencher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Backbencher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_London", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadiq_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sadiq Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_hearts_and_minds", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winning hearts and minds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.thenational.scot/resources/images/18037396/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

I know that Humza will continue to make a substantial contribution to the public life of Scotland and I thank him for all that he has done as our Party Leader and First Minister.\n\nToday is the beginning of a new chapter in our party's history - a chapter that will be about coming together, uniting and dedicating ourselves to the service of Scotland.\n\nI want to express my heartfelt thanks to the many Party members, and the many Elected Members, at Westminster and Holyrood, and in our Councils, for their encouragement to me to stand for the Party leadership.\n\nMy decision to stand is not borne out of long-held ambition, but rather a profound sense of duty to my Party and my country.\n\nI know there is controversy for some that I am the only candidate to stand for the leadership. Perhaps not surprisingly I take a different view. For me, the fact that I am the only candidate demonstrates the Scottish National Party is now coming back together again.\n\nI promised I would create an inclusive and unified team. And I will do that.\n\nI promised I would enable open and respectful dialogue in the SNP. And I will do that.\n\nI promised to make sure the SNP looks outward to the people of our country and not inward amongst ourselves. And I will do that.\n\nI have had the privilege of contributing a significant amount to the SNP story.\n\nIn that time, I have seen the lows and the highs of our modern political history as a Party. And, over those highs and lows, one thing has been clear time after time:\n\nScotland wins when the SNP wins.\n\nYes, we have faced a rough time recently as a Party. But remember what has been happening during that rough time.\n\nThe Scottish child payment is lifting 100,000 children out of poverty.\n\nFree University tuition opens a better future to record numbers of young people from poorer backgrounds.\n\nAnd, the massive expansion of child care is giving children from every background a better start in life.\n\nSo however tough it has been recently for the SNP, never ever forget that at the same time, SNP policies and actions are transforming lives here and now in our country.\n\nAs I begin my leadership of the party I love, I want to speak not just to everyone here at this SNP gathering.\n\nI want to speak to each and every person in this country.\n\nTo those who know me and those who don't.\n\nTo those who support the SNP and those who never have.\n\nAnd, to those who support independence and those we are yet to convince.\n\nI want to set out the vision I have of our nation's future.\n\nI said when I launched my candidacy for leadership that I wanted to create a modern, diverse, dynamic Scotland.\n\nToday I am standing in a building that speaks of that future.\n\nIt is the Advanced Research Centre of the University of Glasgow.\n\nHere in the heart of one of the oldest universities in Europe, research into the newest, leading edge technologies push back the boundaries of what is possible.\n\nExperience and innovation combined.\n\nHistory and modernity together, forging a new future.\n\nThat is the perfect vision for Scotland.\n\nA country with a depth of history, can blend the old and the new and forge the best future for herself.\n\nA country where people have good jobs, the climate is protected, the vulnerable are lifted up and opportunity is available to all.\n\nEvery moment of my journey devoted to building the new Scotland I believe is possible.\n\nLater this week, Scotland will choose a new First Minister.\n\nIn putting my name forward, it is important that I set out what kind of First Minister I will be.\n\nI spoke last week about unifying our party and about what we can do for Scotland together.\n\nI believe the same is true of our Parliament.\n\nIn 2021, the share of the vote commanded by Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats all fell.\n\nThe SNP recorded our best ever share of the constituency vote.\n\nIn fact, we won more votes and a higher share of the votes in the constituency ballot than any party in the 25 year history of devolution.\n\nThat is our mandate but it does not give us a monopoly on good ideas.\n\nIt means that we have the right - in fact, the duty - to form the government. But it does not mean we can stop listening to people and voices outside our party.\n\nThe polarisation of politics does not serve our country well.\n\nToo often, too many people are too busy fighting to win battles when we should be seeking solutions to problems.\n\nThat is what I pledge I will seek to do.\n\nI will reach out to everyone willing to join with us in good faith and seek compromises that serve our nation well.\n\nThat does not mean debate will end - far from it - but it does mean that, should I be elected, I will first seek to find common ground, to join together in coalitions of the willing and solve the problems our country faces.\n\nAnd Friends, I believe recent events show that this approach works.\n\nLast week I met with Kate Forbes. We came together and discussed the shared ambitions we have for our country and how best to go forward. I welcome Kate's support for my leadership.\n\nAnd over the weekend, I reached out to my party colleague Graeme McCormick.\n\nHe wanted to stand for election so he could be heard. So I listened and assured him the views of party members up and down the country will be properly listened to.\n\nThe simple lesson is that dialogue can bring us to points of agreement and strength.\n\nAnd that is my message today to every party in the Scottish Parliament. Focus on solutions to problems and you will find no one more willing to listen than me.\n\nTogether we can make a real difference to the lives of people in Scotland. That is the job we have all been sent to Parliament to do.\n\nOf course, I believe that this country could do more if we had the powers of a normal independent nation - the powers of independence. The cost of living crisis and the damaging impact of Brexit are two examples of Westminster decisions that are bad for Scotland. They demonstrate why Scotland needs to have Independence to make our own decisions and create our best future.\n\nI will always seek, with respect and courtesy, to persuade people of the case for Independence.\n\nAll I ask of those who oppose that vision is they also act with the same courtesy and respect.\n\nThat means Independence is not a reason for them to refuse to work with us to build the economy, support jobs and improve the health service.\n\nIf elected First Minister, my focus will be the economy, jobs, the cost of living. It will be the NHS, our schools and our public services. It will be addressing the climate crisis.\n\nSo to everyone in every party, to every MSP, to every MP. In fact, to everyone in our great country, I say this:\n\nAs we create a vibrant economy in every part of our country.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Glasgow", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Glasgow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Democrats (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brexit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

What about the British state?", "body": "THE august (and increasingly pompous) Financial Times informed us on Saturday - via one of its columnists - that \"the independence argument is dead for a generation\".\n\nWe were even assured that senior SNP figures \"now accept they've nobody but themselves to blame\". Anonymously, of course. Wouldn't do to take public blame and shame. If, indeed, that is what they told the newspaper.\n\nThe FT went on, rather gleefully, to say that John Swinney, assuming he becomes the new SNP leader, \"may be able to slow the decline but there is little chance of him taking Scotland out of the UK\". So that's all right then. The writer, by the way, is Euan McColm, whose scintillating and penetrating analysis of Scottish politics often graces the Daily Mail and The Spectator.\n\nYou can imagine the sighs of relief over the breakfast tables of Britain's ruling elite as they devoured McColm's FT piece over their cornflakes. The SNP's juggernaut \"has veered off course\" and \"today, the SNP is in the deepest crisis of its 90-year history\".\n\nREAD MORE: The Yes movement reacts as John Swinney set to become first minister\n\nFunny that: I thought the 1942 explosion, when John MacCormick and his followers split the party and nearly wrecked it, was pretty existential. Not to mention the jailing of party leader Douglas Young for refusing to be conscripted (yes, SNP top brass have had legal problems before). But then, the memories of political commentators are short. They get paid for instant punditary.\n\nSo, is the Scottish national question dead for the next 30 years, pace McColm? Is independence a dead-duck issue as a result of Humza Yousaf unceremoniously dumping Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater?\n\nIs the entire national question safely off the agenda, so the British media can concentrate on the edifying Punch and Judy show between Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak? Or might it be that most of the British commentariat doesn't know a scoobie about Scottish politics? Methinks the latter.\n\nI can no more predict the exact political future than McColm. But I do know that the fault lines in the structures of the ailing and rickety British state run deep and are unrepairable. I know that Brexit has wrecked business confidence and created vast economic uncertainties. I know that the Labour and Tory parties -the traditional bedrocks of political stability - are being challenged by the populist left and the populist right.\n\nI know that a decade and a half of mindless austerity has simultaneously wrecked the public finances and caused a massive increase in poverty. I know that revered British institutions are failing by the hour - the NHS, the BBC, the rail system and local government.\n\nI've served in the House of Commons and know first-hand that it is a dysfunctional, incompetent, remote sideshow incapable of addressing serious national problems.\n\nSet against this raging series of political firestorms, it is no surprise that half of Scots want to opt out and run their own state. They could hardly make a worse go of it than Messrs Cameron, May, Johnson, Truss and the lacklustre, humourless Sunak over the past 14 years.\n\nThe issue of how Scotland is governed - and who governs it - has dominated Scottish politics for the past 60 years. That's two generations, by conventional counting. In that time, we've had three constitutional referendums (two on more devolution, one on independence).\n\nSupport for independence, as expressed in opinion polls, remains strong. A poll for yesterday's Sunday Times has independence on 48%, versus 52% for staying in the Union. And that's after the SNP's recent travails. No, the national question is not going away till it's resolved.\n\nREAD MORE: SNP activist seeking to challenge John Swinney for party leadership\n\nOf course, that's different from saying the Unionist elite will bow to the will of the Scottish people. And, faced with getting rid of the hapless, dangerous Tory Party, more Scots might temporarily back Labour at the coming General Election.\n\nBut neither circumstance should be interpreted as the independence question disappearing off the agenda.\n\nThe cracks in the British state run too deep and Scotland's problems remain too enormous to think people north of the Border will abandon looking for a Scottish solution to Scotland's difficulties. Especially as those difficulties are largely the result of outside control.\n\nTake but one issue: fuel poverty. Some 31% of all households in Scotland are currently living in fuel poverty, with 20% living in extreme fuel poverty (defined as minimum fuel bills taking up more than 10% of income net of housing costs).\n\nThat's way above the figures for England. Plus fuel poverty in Scotland has jumped by around 10 percentage points since 2019. But why? Scotland regularly supplies more than 15% of UK electricity but consumes less than 10%. In other words, we are giving away our fuel while our low income and OAP households shiver. What's the logic?\n\nIt's not like we are earning money from exporting energy and so able to import more of our necessities. Most of the energy industry is foreign owned. That means the profits flow overseas as well the power being generated.\n\nAccording to a new study by Common Weal, Scotland is one of the most foreign-owned countries in the world. As a result, some \u00a336.5 billion in profits flowed out of Scotland in 2021 alone. We have experienced a net outflow of wealth every year since contemporary records began in 1998. That is around \u00a3277.4bn in total.\n\nIf I have an animus against the SNP Government it is that it has not just allowed this to happen, it has actively encouraged foreign ownership in the hope of investment. But it forgot about the profit drain.\n\nScotland needs independence to regain control of our economy and natural wealth. That imperative is not going away, whatever the commentariat proclaims. The iron logic of the national question cannot be refuted.\n\nWe either command our own future or hand over control to others. If there's a lesson to be learned about the SNP crisis it is that we should be done ceding the initiative over independence to outside institutions, London-based politicians, and anyone other than the Scottish people. It is high time we set the agenda and the timetable for independence in Scotland itself. You don't ask for independence, you take it.\n\nREAD MORE: John Swinney: Leadership challenge from SNP activist will 'delay' rebuild\n\nThat is not rhetoric - it is a political imperative. All independence movements exhibit ebbs and flows. Such ebbs and flows need not be decided by others.\n\nThe next Holyrood election must return a pro-indy majority or risk subordinating the needs of the Scottish people to London-based parties (and probably populist, English nationalist ones).\n\nBut any future pro-indy coalition needs to be willing to confront Westminster rather than sell out the Scottish economy to foreign ownership. We want our factories, our wind farms, our oil refineries and our land back in Scottish ownership. Even under devolved rules, we can do that. Let's make that the issue, then.\n\nThe independence question over for a generation? Only if Britain becomes a land of milk and honey governed by benign geniuses, in a world at peace. Otherwise, like the Irish before them, the Scots are about to wrongfoot the media commentariat by rudely changing the form of the question.", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType": "news",

namely gender recognition reform (GRR) and the deposit return scheme (DRS.)\n\nThe insider said: \"We should be talking about health, education and the economy, not who has a penis and who doesn't.\"\n\nSwinney is not a perfect politician - he failed spectacularly as SNP leader 20 years ago - but he has a better chance of uniting his Government and party than anyone.\n\nHe is the only SNP MSP who can cobble together majorities in parliament and he has the best shot at holding onto power in 2026.\n\nBut to present himself as the future he will need to be unsparingly honest about the failures of the past.\n\nYousaf gave Sturgeon a pass because he was too scared to take her on.\n\nSwinney needs to admit the Sturgeon Government lost its way and a clean break is needed.\n\nTo sign up to the Daily Record Politics newsletter, click here", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_hutcheon@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Paul Hutcheon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Salmond", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alex Salmond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scots language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bute_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bute House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Record_(Scotland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Record (Scotland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article29223736.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Scottish-Budget-Bill-Reaches-Stage-One-Vote.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

You can watch, and read, it in full below.\n\nA year ago, even a week ago, I did not think my future would involve standing here accepting the Leadership of the Scottish National Party.\n\nThings have turned out differently and before I say any more about my leadership I want to pay tribute to Humza Yousaf.\n\nHe has conducted himself throughout the last year with grace and dignity in some acutely difficult circumstances.\n\nIn particular, his moral leadership on the issue of Gaza has been a light in very dark times.\n\nOur party must continue and will continue to be a light.\n\nWe must continue to illuminate hope, fight for international justice and be willing to stand up for what we believe to be right.\n\nThat is what Humza Yousaf did. I know that Humza will continue to make a substantial contribution to the public life of Scotland and I thank him for all that he has done as our Party Leader and First Minister.\n\nToday is the beginning of a new chapter in our party's history - a chapter that will be about coming together, uniting and dedicating ourselves to the service of Scotland.\n\nI want to express my heartfelt thanks to the many Party members, and the many Elected Members, at Westminster and Holyrood, and in our Councils, for their encouragement to me to stand for the Party leadership.\n\nMy decision to stand is not borne out of long-held ambition, but rather a profound sense of duty to my Party and my country.\n\nI know there is controversy for some that I am the only candidate to stand for the leadership.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly I take a different view. For me, the fact that I am the only candidate demonstrates the Scottish National Party is now coming back together again.\n\nI promised I would create an inclusive and unified team. And I will do that.\n\nI promised I would enable open and respectful dialogue in the SNP. And I will do that.\n\nI promised to make sure the SNP looks outward to the people of our country and not inward amongst ourselves. And I will do that.\n\nI have had the privilege of contributing a significant amount to the SNP story.\n\nIn that time, I have seen the lows and the highs of our modern political history as a Party. And, over those highs and lows, one thing has been clear time after time:\n\nScotland wins when the SNP wins.\n\nYes, we have faced a rough time recently as a Party. But remember what has been happening during that rough time.\n\nThe Scottish child payment is lifting 100,000 children out of poverty.\n\nFree University tuition opens a better future to record numbers of young people from poorer backgrounds.\n\nAnd, the massive expansion of child care is giving children from every background a better start in life.\n\nSo however tough it has been recently for the SNP, never ever forget that at the same time, SNP policies and actions are transforming lives here and now in our country.\n\nAs I begin my leadership of the party I love, I want to speak not just to everyone here at this SNP gathering.\n\nI want to speak to each and every person in this country.\n\nTo those who know me and those who don't.\n\nTo those who support the SNP and those who never have.\n\nAnd, to those who support independence and those we are yet to convince.\n\nI want to set out the vision I have of our nation's future.\n\nI said when I launched my candidacy for leadership that I wanted to create a modern, diverse, dynamic Scotland.\n\nToday I am standing in a building that speaks of that future.\n\nIt is the Advanced Research Centre of the University of Glasgow.\n\nHere in the heart of one of the oldest universities in Europe, research into the newest, leading edge technologies push back the boundaries of what is possible.\n\nExperience and innovation combined.\n\nHistory and modernity together, forging a new future.\n\nThat is the perfect vision for Scotland.\n\nA country with a depth of history, can blend the old and the new and forge the best future for herself.\n\nA country where people have good jobs, the climate is protected, the vulnerable are lifted up and opportunity is available to all.\n\nThat is the new chapter I offer.\n\nOne built on experience.\n\nOn skills honed over decades.\n\nEvery moment of my journey devoted to building the new Scotland I believe is possible.\n\nLater this week, Scotland will choose a new First Minister.\n\nIn putting my name forward, it is important that I set out what kind of First Minister I will be.\n\nI spoke last week about unifying our party and about what we can do for Scotland together.\n\nI believe the same is true of our Parliament.\n\nIn 2021, the share of the vote commanded by Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats all fell.\n\nThe SNP recorded our best ever share of the constituency vote.\n\nIn fact, we won more votes and a higher share of the votes in the constituency ballot than any party in the 25 year history of devolution.\n\nThat is our mandate but it does not give us a monopoly on good ideas.\n\nIt means that we have the right - in fact, the duty - to form the government. But it does not mean we can stop listening to people and voices outside our party.\n\nThe polarisation of politics does not serve our country well.\n\nToo often, too many people are too busy fighting to win battles when we should be seeking solutions to problems.\n\nThat is what I pledge I will seek to do.\n\nI will reach out to everyone willing to join with us in good faith and seek compromises that serve our nation well.\n\nThat does not mean debate will end - far from it - but it does mean that, should I be elected, I will first seek to find common ground, to join together in coalitions of the willing and solve the problems our country faces.\n\nWe need to stop shouting at each other and talk.\n\nMore than that, actually, we need to listen.\n\nAnd as First Minister, I will do exactly that.\n\nAnd Friends, I believe recent events show that this approach works.\n\nLast week I met with Kate Forbes. We came together and discussed the shared ambitions we have for our country and how best to go forward. I welcome Kate's support for my leadership.\n\nAnd over the weekend, I reached out to my party colleague Graeme McCormick.\n\nHe wanted to stand for election so he could be heard. So I listened and assured him the views of party members up and down the country will be properly listened to.\n\nThe simple lesson is that dialogue can bring us to points of agreement and strength.\n\nAnd that is my message today to every party in the Scottish Parliament. Focus on solutions to problems and you will find no one more willing to listen than me.\n\nTogether we can make a real difference to the lives of people in Scotland. That is the job we have all been sent to Parliament to do.\n\nOf course, I believe that this country could do more if we had the powers of a normal independent nation - the powers of independence. The cost of living crisis and the damaging impact of Brexit are two examples of Westminster decisions that are bad for Scotland. They demonstrate why Scotland needs to have Independence to make our own decisions and create our best future.\n\nI will always seek, with respect and courtesy, to persuade people of the case for Independence.\n\nAll I ask of those who oppose that vision is they also act with the same courtesy and respect.\n\nThat means Independence is not a reason for them to refuse to work with us to build the economy, support jobs and improve the health service.\n\nIf elected First Minister, my focus will be the economy, jobs, the cost of living. It will be the NHS, our schools and our public services. It will be addressing the climate crisis.\n\nSo to everyone in every party, to every MSP, to every MP. In fact, to everyone in our great country, I say this:\n\nJoin me.\n\nDo not let our disagreements dominate.\n\nJoin me as we open a new chapter.\n\nAs we create a vibrant economy in every part of our country.\n\nAs we tackle the challenges faced by the NHS.\n\nAs we build on the strengths of our schools.\n\nAs we build more homes.\n\nTake climate action.\n\nImprove public transport.\n\nAnd create jobs.\n\nThat's my job, that's our job.\n\nAnd I plan to get the job done.\n\nThank you.", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [],

their same-sex attraction, including through celibacy.\n\nIt also suggests making it an offence to restrict where a person goes, who they see and how they dress.\n\nAny such action would become

What has happened in Scotland has many lessons for the present, and any future, government.\n\nThe consequences of the debacle in Scotland also have implications for the outcome of our forthcoming General Election across the UK.\n\nReaders will remember that Nicola Sturgeon, the former belligerent leader of the SNP, seemed to be riding high in the opinion polls and was extremely smug about how she'd come through the pandemic without the controversies that bedevilled Boris Johnson.\n\nThat was until her and her husband, Peter Murrell, were investigated by the police.\n\nMurrell has now been charged with alleged offences relating to missing cash from the SNP campaign account, for which, as chief executive of that party, he was responsible.\n\nA very messy leadership contest followed Nicola Sturgeon's resignation from the SNP.\n\nNot least because a range of controversial policies had emerged from the SNP's coalition with the Scottish Green Party, as well as a clear neglect of bread-and-butter issues such as delivering decent healthcare, quality of education, and housing renewal and building.\n\nThis is where lessons for UK politicians start to emerge.\n\nFrom inside the split within the SNP itself, as well as across Scotland, emerged what can only be described as \"identity issues\".\n\nIn short, the decision of the Scottish government to introduce legislation to allow individuals, from the age of 16, to \"self-define\" their gender.\n\nIn other words, to change their gender not by going through what is an undoubtedly a difficult and medically challenging process, but simply to say: \"I'm now a woman, or a man\".\n\nProblems with this stance didn't take long to emerge.\n\nA man accused of rape decided to self-identify as a woman and therefore to present as trans.\n\nWhen he was placed in a woman's prison, an understandable storm erupted.\n\nThe Scottish government had to start backpedalling extremely fast and accept that someone who had been accused or found guilty of sexual offences should not be put in a position where others might be at substantial risk.\n\nSo, lesson number one is this: Be very careful indeed if you get sucked into identity politics, particularly when you're pushed about by a small minority of extremely vocal campaigners, whose base in the wider community, or even willingness to compromise, is negligible.\n\nLesson number two: When you get involved with what is sometimes described as the \"culture wars\", you divert attention, time and resources from the real task of delivering public services and running a competent government.\n\nHere, there are lessons for all political parties.\n\nLesson number three (which the present UK Government is also experiencing) is that internal divisions are a political death wish in parties aspiring to government.\n\nIn the UK Conservative Party, we now have National Conservatives, New Conservatives, Popular Conservatives, and the old-style One Nation Tories.\n\nWe have seen, over the last few days following mayoral and local elections in England, what happens when a political party starts to disintegrate.\n\nHence the relevance of what is happening in Scotland to our General Election.\n\nAs the SNP anoint their new leader, John Swinney, in the Edinburgh parliament at Holyrood, the full-scale failure to deliver to the Scottish people is beginning to register in a way that hasn't been true for very many years.\n\nThe beneficiaries should be the Labour Party in Scotland.\n\nThe significance of this is self-evident.\n\nThe more seats Labour can retrieve in Scotland, the more likely Keir Starmer will have an overall majority in the forthcoming general election.\n\nIn 2019, Labour returned just one seat to Westminster from Scotland.\n\nBy-elections have improved the situation, but no one, five years ago, could have envisaged the idea of a Labour revival on the scale which is now possible.\n\nWhat appeared to be a major obstacle to the Labour Party returning to office after 14 years has now taken an unexpected turn, with consequences way beyond the Scottish border.\n\nMuch has been written already about the lessons to be drawn from last Thursday's elections in England.\n\nBut much can be gleaned from the gradual disintegration of the Scottish National Party; and the destructive and overbearing influence of the Scottish Greens, whose style of fringe politics and disconnect from the reality of the lives of the majority has cost the once triumphant Scottish National Party very dear.", "source": {"uri":

One pollster, Ben Page, of Ipsos, was reported as saying Sunak's analysis was \"for the birds\".\n\nIn addition, a senior Tory campaign manager described this view from Downing Street as \"completely mad\" and as almost an invitation to the electorate to vote Labour.\n\nThe main complaint from both pollster and politician was that as there had been no local elections in Scotland last Thursday the PM's view had been based on the results of the 2019 general election, when Labour won only one seat north of the border.\n\nNobody, but nobody, thinks that's a likely scenario; indeed a Scottish survey by Norstat (formerly Panelbase) suggested that Labour could end up with 28 Scottish seats, with the SNP reduced to only 15 seats, compared to the 43 they hold at present. The Tories would increase their tally by three to six seats, with the Lib Dems gaining one to five.\n\nHowever, if Sunak's views of the general election prospects are being heavily challenged from within, everything was sweetness and light over in the SNP corner. At least for now.\n\nThere, as smooth as silk John Swinney graciously accepted the fact that he'd been crowned party leader unopposed when the last of the possible contenders - an unknown lawyer - pulled out of the contest.\n\nI don't think I've ever seen Swinney smile as much as he's doing now, but then why wouldn't he? He's finally got the boss's job at last - First Minister of Scotland, in succession to Humza Yousaf, whom he chose not to serve under, Nicola Sturgeon, for whom he acted as a sort of uber-loyal consigliere and Alex Salmond, with whom he learned all the ropes of tough-guy politics.\n\nHe didn't put independence at the top of this list of policy priorities, much to Wee Eck's annoyance, but I can't imagine anyone thinks that Swinney's about anything else. He insists that he's a straight up and down left of centre moderate. Maybe so but the big difference with others of that ilk is that Honest John - a nickname that he hates, by the way - wants to break up Britain.\n\nOh yes, and he wants politics to be less polarised and not so hostile as it's become - and, yes, he admitted to being guilty of a bit of that sort of rough stuff when the occasion demands.\n\nAll in all we're being asked to believe that this man who's been at the heart of the entire SNP effort since the opening of the Scottish Parliament in 1999 is about to begin a brand new career.\n\nI can only guess that he'll only be able to succeed by insisting that nothing that went wrong in all that time was anything to do with him. But, given how powerful a position he's always enjoyed, why should we believe him?", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Democrats (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2010 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Majority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2019 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downing Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centre-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Salmond", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Salmond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tY4LM2C_NVQ9j9wTQ7P_oA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/742fa0502086ec6cd92c7d6e48ee1cf3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537395", "eventUri": "eng-9537395", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

The only thing Westminster will not allow is a fresh indy referendum. Well, so what? The notion that this is a block on Scotland's voice is a pure invention. Was Scotland quite unable to choose independence for the hundreds of years of Union before referenda were even thought of? And was the SNP simply deluded during the major part of its existence, trying to attain the unattainable?\n\nThe way for the people of Scotland to choose is by voting in a General Election under the appropriate manifesto, which says: if the majority vote for us, Scotland will leave the Union. A vote exceeding 50% in such an election will virtually fill the Scottish seats with indy MPs, sent to Westminster with the clear mandate to take Scotland out. Scotland has no higher representatives, and its MPs are the only body with the right, the power, and the democratic authority. Scotland and England are joined in a Union of Parliaments. If Scotland is to leave the Union at its own hand, that is now the only way open.\n\nREAD MORE: Patrick Harvie speaks out after end of Bute House Agreement\n\nAnd London has no part to play. The decision is Scotland's alone. London will not help, but will relent only if and when Scotland has made the decision, so that independence will finally come about after negotiation. But until the decision is actually made, London has no part in it.\n\nThere is no legal or constitutional prohibition whatsoever to that course. Anyone who claims that there is has the onus of explaining exactly what the barrier is, and to take into consideration matters like the following, which are inconsistent with the existence of any such obstacle:\n\na) In the Edinburgh Agreement of 2012, the UK Government was able to commit to respecting the referendum result, by mere signature of the Prime Minister.\n\nb) UK ordinary law has a standing provision for Northern Ireland to leave if its people so wish.\n\nc) No-one would seriously claim that England could not leave the Union without Scotland's consent.\n\nREAD MORE: SNP activist seeking to challenge John Swinney for party leadership\n\nFirst Minister Sturgeon, who herself had been chiefly responsible for putting about the \"referendum is the only way\" heresy, reverted to the correct course when she stood up in the Scottish Parliament to deliver a ministerial statement on June 28 2022 and stated simply, clearly and unequivocally that \"if the law says that [an independence referendum] is not possible, the General Election will be a de facto referendum.\"\n\nSitting at her right hand was her then deputy first minister, John Swinney, in full support. Mr Swinney now appears to have resiled from that straightforward and entirely proper plan, which is actually the only route open to Scottish independence. Could he please explain to us when he dropped it, and why?\n\nBrian Boyce\n\nMotherwell\n\nTHERE is no newspaper anywhere as brilliantly balanced between the production of high-quality articles by excellent journalists and letters from highly intelligent readers.

Please share if you have family or friends in Barcelona.\"\n\nNews Corp Australia has contacted DFAT for a response on the status of the boy and his mother.\n\nForeign Minister Julie Bishop said a total of eight Australians were caught up in the incident when a van ploughed into crowds on the famed Las Ramblas tourist street, which left at least 13 dead and more than 100 injured.\n\nIt was one of two attacks to rock Spain, with a second incident involving a van ending with five terrorists being shot dead by police.\n\nOf the eight Australians impacted by events in Barcelona, Ms Bishop said four were injured, three required consular support and one is unaccounted for.\n\n\"Of the four injured, that includes one woman, who is from New South Wales in a stable condition, but was seriously injured,\" she told media. \"A second woman, also from New South Wales, is in a serious condition in hospital.\"\n\nIn the Cambrils incident, suspects wearing suicide belts were shot dead by police in Cambrils after ramming into a crowd.\n\nPolice were pursuing a suspicious van that then drove into a pedestrian area on an esplanade, running down six people before the vehicle overturned. A police shootout then followed, with five attackers killed.\n\nFirearms were removed from the scene and belts they were carrying are being treated as potential explosive devices.\n\nReports suggest that the group of terrorists in Cambrils tried to re-create the earlier attack in Barcelona, which came mid afternoon Spanish time and also left at least 100 people injured them, Catalan police confirmed. Fifteen of them are in a critical condition.\n\nLocal media is reporting Spanish police are following up from both incidents with a series of raids in the region surrounding the district centre of Terragona.\n\nPolice earlier warned local residents and tourists at nearby hotels to stay indoors: \"If you're now in Cambrils, avoid going out. Stay home, stay safe,\" the region's civil defence agency said in a tweet.\n\nIt has since tweeted that the situation \"is under control\", though it advised people in the area to remain \"cautious\".\n\nTwo men - a Spanish national and a Moroccan - have been arrested in relation to the attack but police said the driver of the van was still on the run.\n\nIslamic State has claimed responsibility for the terror attack, according to the Amaq news agency.\n\nTERROR IN BARCELONA\n\nAfter the van attack in Barcelona, authorities said a Belgian was among the dead and a Greek woman was among the injured.\n\nGermany's Foreign Ministry said it was checking reports that German citizens were among the victims.\n\nAt least one Australian from NSW is reported to be in a serious condition.\n\nForeign Minister Julie Bishop said two Victorians were waiting to seek medical attention for minor injuries, and the total number killed in the incident was 16. This death toll is yet to be confirmed.\n\nThere were scenes of panic on the famous thoroughfare, with bodies strewn in the street.\n\nEyewitnesses said the van was travelling at speeds of up to 80km/h when it mounted the footpath, and then zigzagged down the Las Ramblas promenade for up to 500m before it came to rest with a badly injured person crumpled near the front wheels.\n\nTerrified tourists were seen fleeing as the van smashed its way through street furniture and pedestrians, in an attack chillingly similar to those in London this year, and in Nice in southern France a year ago.\n\nIslamic State has claimed responsibility for the terror attack, according to the Amaq news agency.\n\nTERROR ARRESTS\n\nFollowing the attack, Spanish police distributed an image of Driss Oukabir, whose ID had been found in a second rental van believed to be the getaway vehicle.\n\nThe 28-year-old Catalan resident of Moroccan origin later handed himself in to police in Ripoll, about 100km from Barcelona.\n\nOukabir claimed that his younger brother, Moussa Oukabir, 18, had stolen his documents.\n\nThe second person arrested was a Spanish national born in the Spanish territory of Melilla in northern Morocco.\n\n\"It was clearly a terror attack, intended to kill as many people as possible,\" Josep Lluis Trapero, a senior police official, told a news conference this morning.\n\nThe arrests took place in the northern Catalan town of Ripoll, and in Alcanar, some 200 kilometres south of Barcelona, the site of a gas explosion at a house earlier in the week which was initially thought to be drug related.\n\nPolice now suspect the explosion is linked to the van attack.\n\nTrapero said the explosion left at least one person dead, and police suspected those in the house were \"preparing an explosive device.\"\n\n\"It seems there was an accumulation of gas that generated the explosion,\" he said, without giving further details.\n\nThe town of Cambrils, the site of an ongoing police operation, on the coastal road between Barcelona and Alcanar.\n\nThe area around Barcelona's Las Ramblas was sealed off for blocks in each direction, and tourists and locals were desperately trying to find loved ones, as the mobile phone network in the area struggled to cope.\n\nIslamic State's Amaq news agency published a statement saying: \"The perpetrators of the Barcelona attack are soldiers of the Islamic State and carried out the operation in response to calls for targeting coalition states\" - a reference to a US-led coalition against the Sunni militant group.",

police arrested two people after the attack, but the driver fled on foot and remained at large on Friday morning (local time).\n\nPolice said the attack in Barcelona was connected to two other incidents: one in the resort town of Cambrils, south of Barcelona, and one in the town of Alcanar.\n\nFive suspected terrorists who police said were carrying bomb belts were shot dead in Cambrils after their car was reportedly driven into pedestrians, injuring seven people -- one critically.\n\nAn explosion in a house in Alcanar, where police believe a homemade bomb was being prepared, killed

Please like and share.\n\n\"We have found Jom (his mum, my cousin-in-law) and she is in a serious but stable condition in hospital.\"\n\n\"Julian is 7 years old and was out with Jom when they were separated, due to the recent terrorist activity.\n\n\"Please share, especially if you have family or friends in Barcelona. Thank you.\"\n\nJulian's father is believed to have flown from Sydney to Spain to search for his missing boy.\n\nA woman from California is also desperately hunting for her husband, who is still missing after the attack.\n\nHeidi Nunes said she and her husband Jared Tucker, 43, were shopping in the area when the terrorists struck.\n\nAnd photos of Francisco Lopez Rodriguez taken just before the devastating attack have been circulated on Twitter as his worried family say he is missing.\n\nThe mayor of Tongeren, east of Brussels, confirmed a woman from the town died in the attack last night.\n\nPatrick Dewael tweeted of the unnamed woman's death and told Belgian radio that he had presided over her wedding in 2014.\n\nBelgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders also confirmed that two Belgians were wounded in the attack, one of them seriously.\n\nISIS claimed the van attack in the Spanish city last night, which killed at least 13 people and injured 100 is still being hunted by Spanish cops.\n\nTwo suspects were arrested yesterday - a Spanish national from Melilla and a Moroccan - but neither was steering the vehicle despite being directly involved in the massacre.\n\nA third person has been arrested in the city of Ripoll this morning. It is not clear if the suspect was the driver.\n\nThe van involved in the deadly Las Ramblas attack was reportedly rented by a man named as Driss Oukabir. According to local media, Oukabir is a Spanish national of North African descent.\n\nOukabir, 28, handed himself to police in Ripoll, northern Catalonia, after seeing his face on news reports, according to Spanish media.\n\nLocal reports claim he told investigating officers his brother Moussa Oukabir, 18, stole his ID to rent the van and insists he had no part in the deadly attack. It is not known if Moussa Oukabir is the third arrest.\n\nThe crash van entered a pedestrian area at the junction of Las Ramblas and Placa Catalunya at around 5pm local time on Thursday and ploughed into a sea of shoppers and tourists.\n\nThe rampaging vehicle zigzagged through the Las Ramblas area mowing down innocent people prompting terrified families to run for their lives.\n\nA three-year-old child has been confirmed as one of the victims, Spanish media have said.\n\nAt least 24 different nationalities were among those killed and injured in the horrific attack.\n\nThree Dutch were injured, with three Greek nationals, a mother and her two children, also hurt.\n\nChina has confirmed a Hong Kong citizen suffered minor injuries and four Australians were also hurt in the attack.\n\nThree Italian nationals were also injured and the US released information that one American suffered minor injuries.\n\nThe UK's Foreign Office has not received any confirmed reports of Brits hurt in the attack.\n\nAccording to French media at least 24 French nationals were injured, with 11 said to be in a serious condition.\n\nAn Irish family of four were caught up in the horror last night - with the two parents and two children said to have non life-threatening injuries.\n\nOne of the children, a five-year-old boy, broke his leg in the attack.\n\nIreland's Department of Foreign Affairs is assisting the family. Its officials opened a hotline in Dublin for anyone concerned about relatives in Spain on 01-408 2000, while the Irish Embassy in Madrid is also fielding calls on +34 9143 64093.", "id": "9848170",

Please like and share. We have found Jom and she is serious but stable in hospital,\" she said.\n\n\"Julian is 7 years old and was out with Jom and they were separated. Please share if you have family or friends in Barcelona.\"\n\nShe said that Jom's husband Andrew was flying to Barcelona tonight from Sydney to be with his wife and to help find Julian.\n\nThe family has also put a call-out on Facebook in the hope of tracking the boy down.\n\nHis grandfather, Tony Cadman, has posted this message on his Facebook page:\n\n\"My nephew Julian Cadman is missing. Please like and share. We have found Jom and she is serious but stable in hospital,\" Claire O'Sullivan wrote on Facebook.\n\nAndrew's boss Scott Bowman said that Jom and Julian were over in Barcelona for a friend's wedding, only arriving in Spain in the last few days.\n\nHe said the father-of-one found out about the Barcelona attack at 6am over the radio at work.\n\n\"He turned up for work this morning, put the radio on and heard about the attack,\" Mr Bowman said.\n\n\"He said I better ring my wife and see if she's all right. He couldn't get on to her.\"\n\nMr Bowman said he then sent Andrew home to try and figure out what was going on.\n\nJom and Julian, who goes to St Bernadettes Primary in Lalor Park in Sydney, had been over in Spain for a friend's wedding while Andrew was staying back in Sydney to work.\n\n\"He started to get some sort of news... they had found his wife in hospital at 8.30am this morning, but they don't know where Julian is... we still don't know,\" he said.\n\n\"We don't know if he is dead or alive at the moment, I'm having trouble grasping that 10 hours can pass and a seven year old is in a country by himself.\n\n\"I hate to think this way but if I was in Spain with a seven-year-old I would be holding his hand.\"\n\nMr Bowman said Jom, who is originally from the Philippines but had been living in Lalor Park with her husband, was in an induced coma.\n\n\"All that we've been told is that she is in a serious condition, she has got multiple fractures everywhere - arms, legs, severe facial injuries. She has suspected spinal injuries and possible internal injuries,\" he said.\n\nMr Bowman said Andrew was a \"bloody mess\" and catching a flight out to Spain later tonight.\n\n\"He is flying over there tonight, I can't comprehend what he is going through.\"\n\nHe said they were a close-knit family and Andrew worked hard as a cabinet maker.\n\n\"It is just the three of them, they are close.\"\n\nNews Corp Australia has contacted DFAT for a response on the status of the boy and his mother.\n\nThe news came as Sydney-based Commonwealth bank worker Suria Intan was also named as a victim in the attacks. She is in a serious but stable condition in the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona.\n\nShe was meant to come home to Australia this weekend after a three-week holiday with three girlfriends. Together, they visited London's Sky Garden, the Eiffel Tower, the Bernese Alps and Lake Thun in Switzerland, Positano and Ravello on the Amalfi Coast, according to photos posted on Facebook.\n\nThey also went to Barcelona's famous Sagrada Familia basilica.\n\nMs Intan, from Campsie, grew up in Indonesia and studied in Sydney.\n\nHer LinkedIn profile said she has worked for the Commonwealth Bank in Lidcombe for 11 years. She is also involved in the Hillsong Church.\n\nA spokesman for the Church said they had been in touch with Hillsong in Barcelona to support her.\n\nForeign Minister Julie Bishop said a total of eight Australians were caught up in the incident when a van ploughed into crowds on the famed Las Ramblastourist street, which left at least 13 dead and more than 100 injured.\n\nIt was one of two attacks to rock Spain, with a second incident involving a van ending with five terrorists being shot dead by police.\n\nOf the eight Australians impacted by events in Barcelona, Ms Bishop said four were injured, three required consular support and one is unaccounted for.\n\n\"Of the four injured, that includes one woman, who is from New South Wales in a stable condition, but was seriously injured,\" she told media. \"A second woman, also from New South Wales, is in a serious condition in hospital.\"\n\nThe youngest victim of the Barcelona attack is believed to be a three-year-old girl. A six-year-old girl is also seriously ill in hospital.\n\nCitizens from 24 countries are among the 13 killed and 100 wounded in the attack in Las Ramblas, Catalan officials said.\n\nThree of the dead are believed to be German. A Belgian had also died.\n\nFrance says 26 of its citizens are injured, at least 11 of them seriously.\n\nThree people from the Netherlands are among the wounded, along with a woman and her two

gripped Spain, killing 13 people.\n\nAround 100 more were injured in two separate attacks which saw suspects plough vehicles into civilians in Barcelona and later in Cambrils.\n\nHere's what we know so far:\n\nThe first attack began shortly after 5pm local time (4pm BST), when a white Fiat van sped through Las Ramblas, a busy street in Barcelona.\n\nAt least 13 people were killed and more than 100 were injured as the driver ploughed into people along a 500 metre stretch of the pedestrianised area.\n\nAccording to witnesses the white van swerved from side to side as it drove into tourists and residents.\n\nThe driver then fled, leaving a scene of widespread panic, with crowds running in waves away from the area.\n\nCitizens of 24 countries were among those killed and injured in Barcelona including one Belgian national confirmed to have died.\n\nThe French foreign ministry said 26 French nationals were injured, including 11 seriously.\n\nPolice have made three arrests in connection with the incident, including Driss Oukabir, a 28-year-old Moroccan who is believed to have rented the van.\n\nBut the driver is believed to be still on the run.\n\nEight hours later terrorists strike again, this time in Cambrils, a coastal town and resort 68 miles down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nIn the second attack, a gang wearing suicide belts rammed civilians with a car before being shot dead by police.\n\nSeven people including a police officer were injured in Cambrils.\n\nFour of the attackers were shot dead at the scene and a fifth died later of his injuries.\n\nThe police force for Spain's Catalonia region says the five suspects shot and killed in the resort town of Cambrils were carrying bomb belts, which were detonated by the force's bomb squad.\n\nOf the six civilians caught up in the Cambrils attack, two were said to be in a serious condition.\n\nIslamic State has claimed responsibility for the Barcelona attack, the deadliest in Spain since more than 190 people died in the 2004 Madrid train bombs.\n\nSee more of Metro.co.uk's coverage on the attacks in Spain here.\n\nMORE: 'Racist' waiter fired for writing 'Ching Chong' on

Its officials opened a hotline in Dublin for anyone concerned about relatives in Spain on 01-408 2000, while the Irish Embassy in Madrid is also fielding calls on +34 9143 64093.", "id": "9846185", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Aussie boy, 7, among dozens missing after getting separated from his mum during Barcelona terror", "image": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/08/nintchdbpict000346451611.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=671&h=800&crop=1", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "12", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "74", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Morocco"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "137", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Morocco"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "151106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Catalunya"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "163729", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "label": {"eng": "Catalunya"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "227084", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Prov\u00edncia de Girona"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "243884", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Girona", "label": {"eng": "Prov\u00edncia de Girona"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Ripoll"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "244563", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripoll", "label": {"eng": "Ripoll"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Melilla"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "245841", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melilla", "label": {"eng": "Melilla"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islamic State of Iraq"}, "id": "303094", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}, "id": "303577", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tourism"}, "id": "303659", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"}, {"label": {"eng": "La Rambla, Barcelona"}, "id": "303748", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Rambla,_Barcelona"}, {"label": {"eng": "North Africa"}, "id": "309042", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 161, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 645, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost or Missing", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost_or_Missing"}], "time": "07:54:00"}

The attackers ran them over in a car, before police shot them dead and carried out controlled explosions.\n\nPolice said the two incidents were linked.\n\nThe Las Ramblas strip, much of which is pedestrian-only, reopened in the morning after the attack. Although a police presence and security tape was still visible, people were able to move around the street, many carrying backpacks or pushing suitcases.\n\nSpain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy described it as a \"jihadist attack\".\n\nHe announced three days of national mourning and a minute's silence will be held later on Friday.\n\nThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack in a brief statement, saying it was carried out by \"Islamic State soldiers\". The group gave no further evidence or details to back up their claim.\n\nJom Cadman, one of four Australians injured in the events, was in Barcelona to attend her niece's wedding. She was caught up in the van attack in the city, and remains in a serious condition.\n\nHer son, Julian Cadman, was separated from his mother during the van attack on the boulevard, his family said.\n\nThe boy's father, Andrew Cadman, said he had spoken to the pair only several hours before the attack. He said he was flying to Barcelona tonight to search for his son.\n\n\"If you know anyone in that area that you can share this with, please do so,\" the boy's godfather Colin Baxter wrote on Facebook.\n\nNew Zealand's government said no so far New Zealanders have been caught up in the Barcelona terrorist attack.

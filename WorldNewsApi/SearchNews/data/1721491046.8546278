Glenda Muron told Global News her cat Wilma went missing from her home in Arbour Lake back on May 28. Muron said she searched for six days until a neighbour said he had seen Wilma\u2019s remains in a nearby field. That same neighbour added he\u2019d seen a bobcat patrolling the field for several days. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating quite frankly to lose her that way,\u201d Muron said tearfully. Muron said others have told her that Wilma was the third pet cat to have been killed by the wild cat in the area in the past few weeks. The Nova Scotia native, who just moved to Calgary a few years ago, said she was shocked to learn bobcats are regularly seen inside the city limits. \u201cI was in shock,\u201d she said incredulously. \u201cI live in the suburbs!\u201d Wildlife experts said bobcat sightings have become increasingly common inside and outside Calgary city limits. \u201cThe bobcat population really does seem to have exploded,\u201d said Sara Jordan-McLachlan, a conservation analyst with the Miistakis Institute. Back in 2021, she researched bobcats and their range in the city, and while she doesn\u2019t have exact numbers of how many bobcats call Calgary home, their numbers have increased. \u201cWe actually have a real ideal landscape for them,\u201d Jordan-McLachlan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of greenspaces for them to live in and we\u2019ve got a lot of prey that\u2019s inside of the city.\u201d Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: \"We've got a lot of greenspaces for them to live in and we've got a lot of prey that's inside of the city.\" Their prey usually consists of small rodents and rabbits, but Jordan-McLachlan said small cats and dogs can be at risk too if the animal is hungry enough. Humans, including children, are not usually at risk. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be fearful of them,\u201d she said. \u201cAs far as the danger to humans \u2013 it\u2019s very low.\u201d Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: \"As far as the danger to humans - it's very low.\" \u201cYou\u2019re not as tasty as you think. We\u2019re not actually on their menu at all and the only reason they\u2019d be interacting with us at all is probably in a defensive behaviour.\u201d Jordan-McLachlan added bobcats generally only attack humans if they, or their offspring, feel attacked. She said that as the city grows, encounters are likely to increase. \u201cAs we continue to develop into these suburb areas we are going to be interacting more with wildlife.\u201d How to deal with bobcats Alberta Fish and Wildlife Enforcement Services told Global News it hadn\u2019t received any recent reports of bobcats attacking cats in the Arbour Lake area. It urged anyone who is concerned to contact them. To prevent bobcats from coming to your property, Fish and Wildlife recommends: Removing any food, shelter or water that may attract them to your propertyNot leaving pet food outdoors and do not feed themRemoving bird feeders and bird baths so bobcats are not drawn into your yard to prey on the birdsTrimming trees, shrubs and even grass so there is no shelter for bobcats to hide in. Spaces under decks and outbuildings should be closed off for the same reasonAdding motion detector lighting to walkways and driveways to deter them from calling your home their homeKeeping dogs, cats, rabbits, chickens or other animals that live outdoors in a secure enclosure Muron said she came forward to help other pet owners avoid the heartache she\u2019s going through. She said she knew there was a risk to letting Wilma wander, but added she was a feral cat for years, and there was no way to stop her from going outside. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to clip her wings or her spirit.\u201d Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: \"I wasn't going to clip her wings or her spirit.\"", "summary": "A Calgary cat owner is warning others after she believes her beloved pet was one of several attacked and killed in a field right by her home.", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10571941/calgary-cat-owner-warns-others-after-pet-killed-by-bobcat/", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ultimate-ultimate-b-cat1.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:27:38", "author": "Tomasia DaSilva", "authors": ["Tomasia DaSilva"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.187}

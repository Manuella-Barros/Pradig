The historic deliberations follow Tuesday\u2019s whirlwind of closing arguments, which stretched into the evening hours as prosecutor Joshua Steinglass accused Trump of intentionally deceiving voters by allegedly participating in a \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d scheme to bury stories that might obliterate his 2016 presidential bid. Steinglass further suggested that Trump operated with a \u201ccavalier willingness\u201d to hide payoffs and did so in a way that left \u201cno paper trail.\u201d The defense approached its summation much in the same way it approached cross-examination: by targeting the credibility of star witness Michael Cohen. Defense lawyer Todd Blanche branded Trump\u2019s former lawyer as \u201cthe greatest liar of all time\u201d while urging jurors to quickly acquit his client. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges which are punishable by up to four years in prison. He has denied all wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty. At the heart of the charges are reimbursements paid to Cohen for a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in exchange for not going public with her claim about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump. Prosecutors say the reimbursements were falsely logged as \u201clegal expenses\u201d to hide the true nature of the transactions. The case is the first of Trump\u2019s four indictments to reach trial and is the first-ever criminal case against a former U.S. president. Currently: \u2014 Cohen\u2019s credibility, campaigning at court and other highlights from closing arguments \u2014 Rallies and debates used to define campaigns. Now they\u2019re about juries and trials \u2014 Biden\u2019s campaign shows up outside Trump\u2019s trial with Robert De Niro and others \u2014 Another big name will be at the courthouse in Manhattan on Wednesday: Harvey Weinstein \u2014 Trump hush money case: A timeline of key events Here\u2019s the latest: WHO IS ON THE JURY? The jury in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial is comprised of 18 Manhattan residents. The main jury includes seven men and five women. There are also six alternate jurors who\u2019ve listened to the testimony, but won\u2019t join in the deliberations unless one of the main jurors needs to drop out or is removed. The jury represents a diverse cross-section of the borough and come from various professional backgrounds, including a sales professional, a software engineer, a security engineer, a teacher, a speech therapist, multiple lawyers, an investment banker and a retired wealth manager. Jurors\u2019 names are being kept from the public. A RECAP OF TESTIMONY JURORS HEARD IN THE CASE Across more than four weeks of testimony, prosecutors called 20 witnesses. The defense called just two. Among the prosecution\u2019s key witnesses: Trump\u2019s former attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, porn actor Stormy Daniels, tabloid publisher David Pecker and lawyer Keith Davidson, who negotiated hush money deals for Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Cohen testified that he paid $130,000 in hush money to Daniels at Trump\u2019s behest weeks before the 2016 election to keep her quiet about her claims of a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. Trump denies the encounter took place. Cohen also said Trump was involved in an arrangement to repay him and log the payments as legal expenses. Daniels gave an at-times graphic account of the alleged encounter. Pecker testified about agreeing to be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of Trump\u2019s campaign by tipping Cohen off to negative stories, including Daniels\u2019 claim. Davidson talked about negotiating the deals and what he said was Cohen\u2019s frustration after the Daniels deal that Trump still hadn\u2019t repaid him. The defense\u2019s big witness was attorney Robert Costello, who testified last Monday and Tuesday about negotiating to represent Cohen after the FBI raided Cohen\u2019s properties in 2018. HOW WILL THE JURY DELIBERATIONS WORK? Jury deliberations in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that\u2019s intentionally opaque. Jurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it\u2019s hard to read too much into the meaning of any note. ANOTHER FAMOUS FACE AT THE COURTHOUSE Donald Trump will not be the only big name appearing before a judge in lower Manhattan on Wednesday \u2014 fallen movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is expected to appear for a hearing related to the retrial of his landmark #MeToo-era rape case. The hearing will take place in the same courthouse where Trump is currently on trial and where Weinstein was originally convicted in 2020. Weinstein\u2019s conviction was overturned in April after the court found that the trial judge unfairly allowed testimony against Weinstein based on allegations that weren\u2019t part of the case. His retrial is slated for sometime after Labor Day. A MOTION THAT STILL HASN\u2019T BEEN DECIDED The judge in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial might have one last piece of business to address on Wednesday before jurors receive instructions and can begin deliberations. Last Monday, defense lawyers filed a motion asking the judge to dismiss the case, arguing that prosecutors had failed to prove their case and there was no evidence of falsified business records or an intent to defraud. Prosecutors rebutted that assertion, saying \u201cthe trial evidence overwhelmingly supports each element\u201d of the alleged offenses, and the case should proceed to the jury. Judge Juan M. Merchan did not indicate at the time when he would issue a decision on the request. More than a week later, it remains unclear whether he will address it before the case goes to the jury. WHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION? Jurors in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial are expected to begin deliberations on Wednesday after receiving instructions from the judge on the law that governs the case and what they can consider as they strive toward a verdict in the first criminal case against a former U.S. president. The panel has a weighty task ahead of them \u2014 deciding whether to convict or acquit Trump of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he\u2019s charged with. But what had to be proved for a conviction? To convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors had to convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous. To prevent a conviction, the defense needed to convince at least one juror that prosecutors didn\u2019t prove Trump\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases. If the jury deadlocks after several days of deliberations and are unable to reach a unanimous verdict, the judge may declare a mistrial.", "summary": "Jury deliberations in Donald Trump \u2018s criminal hush money trial are expected to begin Wednesday after the panel receives instructions from the judge on the law governing the case and what they can take into account in evaluating the former president\u2019s guilt or innocence.", "url": "https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/05/29/the-latest-trumps-criminal-trial-to-enter-deliberations-phase-after-jury-receives-instructions/", "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Trump_Hush_Money_06108.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:03:10", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.195}

In any professional sports draft, there\u2019s a lot of analyzing and dissecting the measurables, there\u2019s some projecting, but there\u2019s also a bit of guessing. Guess right often enough and you win a lot of games. Guess wrong too often, your team flounders and you lose your job. The guessing that goes into the NHL draft becomes more problematic when you\u2019re trying to figure out the potential of teenage Russian hockey players. On Friday, the Montreal Canadiens got Russian forward Ivan Demidov with the fifth overall pick, the New Jersey Devils got Russian defenceman Anton Silayev with the 10th pick. Nice. For the teams. And, for the kids. Here\u2019s the thing, though. Both were thought of as Top 5 picks. Many hockey thinkers identified Demidov as the second-most talented forward. Silayev also drew rave reviews. TSN\u2019s Craig Button had Demidov going third and Silayev fourth. It\u2019s not like they slipped a lot. But it\u2019s also possible they fell a bit because of their country of birth. It\u2019s hard for NHL scouts to evaluate Russian hockey players, much more difficult than it used to be. It has become a great divide. There\u2019s an international backlash because Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Russian teams are banned from playing in international tournaments, plus there are travel restrictions. Many of the kids are already signed to pro contracts in Russia. Agent Daniel Milstein tried to get exposure for his Russian hockey clients when he had a showcase combine in Florida earlier this month. So, there\u2019s that. But it\u2019s not easy getting boots on the ground, so the evaluation process is different. Maybe there\u2019s more guessing. And that\u2019s difficult for NHL teams who want to lessen their chances of swinging and missing. ICE CHIPS Sure enough, when NHL commissioner Gary Bettman gave his opening remarks, there were boos from the audience. Love it \u2026 No surprise with the No. 1 pick: The San Jose Sharks selected Celebrini, a centre out of Boston University. The selection was made by Joe Thornton\u2019s beard \u2026 Asked about Celebrini, Sharks GM Mike Grier said: \u201cAll the great players are driven \u2026 and he has it.\u201d \u2026 Family friend Steve Nash (yep, the Canadian former NBA star) was there to support the Celebrinis \u2026 The first trade of the night happened with Philadelphia, at 12th overall moving the pick to Minnesota for the 13th and a third-round pick in 2025. The Wild took University of Denver defenceman Zeev Buium, who some scouts had ranked a lot higher \u2026 Legendary boxing announcer Michael Buffer made Philadelphia\u2019s first pick, Guelph Storm centre Jett Luchanko. And, he did it in that voice, opening the selection with, \u201cLet\u2019s Get Ready to Rumble.\u201d \u2026 Winger Michael Brandseg-Nygard became the first Norwegian first-rounder ever, taken 15th by the Detroit Red Wings. PICK \u2018EM Connor Bedard, the No. 1 overall pick from a year ago, made the second overall pick for the Chicago Blackhawks; it was Artyom Levshunov (from Belarus), a right-shot defenceman who played at Michigan State last year. Levshunov\u2019s dad died two years ago at the age of 46 due to heart complications from COVID-19. Levshunov lists Usain Bolt as his favourite athlete \u2026 Scott Niedermayer made the Anaheim Ducks\u2019 first pick (third overall), Oshawa Generals winger Beckett Sennecke \u2026 Picking fourth for Columbus was Rick Nash; the Blue Jackets took Medicine Hat centre Cayden Lindstrom (he lists his favourite non-hockey athletes as Michael Jordan and Muhammad Ali). Lindstrom said he writes \u201cFTF\u201d on his stick and his equipment and he had it inside the suit jacket he wore to the draft \u2013 it is short for \u201cFor the Fam.\u201d \u2026 Celine Dion, the team\u2019s \u201cNo. 1 fan,\u201d made the Montreal Canadiens\u2019 first pick \u2013 Demidov. He has a year remaining in his KHL commitment \u2026 Owners Ryan and Ashley Smith made the first-ever pick by the Utah Hockey Club (the former Arizona Coyotes), taking Kelowna Rockets winger Tij Iginla, the son of former NHL star Jarome. Interesting stat: Dad was picked 11th overall, five spots behind the kid \u2026 The Senators didn\u2019t get a former player to make their pick; GM Steve Staios called out the name of 6-foot-3 right-shot defenceman Carter Yakemchuk, who led WHL defencemen with 30 goals this past year. His favourite non-hockey athlete is Connor McGregor \u2026 The second overall pick in 2021, Matty Beniers, made Seattle\u2019s first pick, eighth overall, Spokane Chiefs centre Berkly Catton \u2026 With the ninth pick, the Calgary Flames went with Saginaw Spirit defenceman Zayne Parekh, as exciting an offensive player as there is in the draft. Some compare him to the dynamics of Erik Karlsson. The big question: Can he play a bit of defence, too. \u201cI believe in the way I play,\u201d said Parekh. \u201cIt\u2019s a translatable game.\u201d \u2026 Martin Brodeur made New Jersey\u2019s first pick \u2013 Silayev, a 6-foot-7 left-handed defenceman, with the 10th pick. THE FINAL WORD Loved the venue for the draft, the Sphere, which has gained notoriety for hosting U2 (a 40-show residency). The Eagles will have an eight-show residency on weekends beginning in September. The graphics and LED lights were spectacular \u2026 Good job by the Sportsnet crew doing the TV broadcast, but it always seems to me the TSN panel would be better \u2026 It won\u2019t be the same after this draft. Beginning next year, the league will change to a format similar to what the NFL uses, a decentralized model where general managers and scouts remain in their home markets to make their selections \u2026 Winger Cole Eiserman, possibly the best goal scorer in the draft, fell to the New York Islanders at the 20th pick \u2026 The Toronto Maple Leafs were supposed to choose 23rd overall. Supposed to. But, more than 2 1/2 hours into the draft, after hearing a lot of boos, the Leafs dealt their top pick to Anaheim for picks 31 and 58. Defenceman Stian Soldberg, the second Norwegian to go in the first round, went to Anaheim.

In the other start he lasted three innings. That was due mostly to a 40-minute rain delay on Sunday against Toronto at Progressive Field. The three homers he allowed in those three innings probably meant that he wasn\u2019t long for that game rain or shine. Friday night McKenzie packed a lot of action into his 2 1/3 innings at Kauffman Stadium. He allowed two homers and was charged with five runs as the Guardians fell to Kansas City, 10-3. The AL Central-leading Guardians have lost three straight, matching their longest losing streak of the season, The Royals, meanwhile, have reduced their deficit in the division from nine to seven games. The first two games of this four-game series have followed a similar pattern. The Royals are playing like a team trying to get back in the race, while Guardians are playing like a team that\u2019s been in first place for 94 days. A promising start quickly spun sideways for the Guardians. Jose Ramirez, with two out in the first, homered to deep right field for a 1-0 lead. It was his 22nd homer of the season and his sixth in June. The Royals rank second on Ramirez\u2019s all-time home run list with 30. The White Sox are first with 34.s McKenzie\u2019s issue with the long ball quickly reduced Ramirez\u2019s homer to a footnote. Salvador Perez and Hunter Renfroe opened the second with consecutive homers for a 2-1 lead. They were the 18th and 19th homers McKenzie (3-5, 5.11) has allowed this year to lead the big leagues. McKenzie kept the ball in the yard after that, but he was not long for the game. He struck out Kyle Isbel to start the third, but the next five Royals reached base on the way to a three-run inning and a 5-1 lead. Maikel Garcia singled. McKenzie fell behind Bobby Witt Jr., who hit two monster home runs off him in Cleveland on June 4, before intentionally walking him. Vinnie Pasquantino and Perez followed with RBI single to make it 4-1. When McKenzie walked Renfroe to load the bases, he was done for the night. Pedro Avila relieved and allowed an RBI single to MJ Melendez to make it 5-1 before Nick Loftin bounced back to the mound to start a double play. McKenzie in his last seven starts is 1-2 with a 7.47 ERA (26 runs in 31 1/3 innings). He has allowed 30 hits, including 13 homers, with 21 walks and 34 strikeouts. Now the question is how long he\u2019ll stay in the rotation. Gavin Williams is due to be activated next week from the injured list and is expected to be added to the rotation. The Guardians are said to be in the final stages of signing veteran lefty Matthew Boyd as well, but he is not expected to be immediately brought to the big leagues Royals starter Alec Marsh (6-5, 4.19), working with a comfortable lead, controlled the Guardians through six innings. He held them to one run on four hits on 91 pitches. David Fry started the second with a single, but was picked off first when broke for second, stopped and then tried to get back to the bad. It was unclear if it was a botched hit and run or not. Whenever the Guardians did threaten Marsh, they seemed to bounce into a double play. Tyler Freeman (second inning), Fry (fourth) and Ramirez (sixth) all grounded into double plays. Here\u2019s what kind of game it was for the Guards. They needed both their long me to get through it. Avila pitched 1 2/3 innings and Darren McCaughan covered the final four. He bore the brunt of the Royals\u2019 offense, including getting burned by Pasquantino\u2019s three-run homer in the eighth. Cleveland finished with eight hits. Fry led the way with three. The Royals, 29-15 at home, had 13 hits.

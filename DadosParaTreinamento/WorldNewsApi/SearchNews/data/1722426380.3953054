The resolution, introduced by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) member Shaista Pervaiz Malik, criticised the US resolution passed on June 25. Malik stated that the American resolution displayed a complete ignorance of Pakistan\u2019s electoral process. \u201cThe House takes notice of the resolution passed by the US House of Representatives concerning Pakistan,\u201d Malik declared during the session. Malik argued that such interference in Pakistan\u2019s internal affairs was inappropriate and unbecoming of global powers. \u201cThis kind of meddling in our country\u2019s internal matters is unacceptable,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not appropriate for any global power to interfere in the internal affairs of another country.\u201d Amid opposition uproar, Malik responded by highlighting the global violations of human rights. \u201cJust as we condemn human rights violations around the world, we should denounce this interference,\u201d she asserted. \u201cIt is shameful that Pakistan\u2019s sovereignty is under attack and some among us are encouraging this assault. It is regrettable that foreign powers are meddling in our internal matters, and we must deter them,\u201d Malik added. Malik urged everyone to condemn these actions. \u201cWe should all denounce these steps, but some are supporting foreign interference, which questions our nation\u2019s sovereignty.\u201d Shagufta Jumani remarked, \u201cThose supporting this have no right to call themselves Pakistanis. This is our country, and they should stop interfering.\u201d Meanwhile, opposition members chanted, \u201cCipher, cipher, shame, shame.\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday announced that the government would introduce a resolution in the National Assembly in response to the one passed by the US House of Representatives a day earlier expressing \u201crobust support\u201d for democracy in Pakistan. Responding to the Sunni Ittehad Council MNAs who pointed out the US legislation during the budget session, the deputy premier stressed the need to express the country\u2019s sovereignty and unity. On Wednesday, the US House of Representatives passed a resolution with a staggering majority of 98%, calling for a \u201cfull and independent investigation of claims of interference or irregularities in Pakistan\u2019s February 2024 election\u201d. A total of 368 members voted in favour of the resolution against only seven opposing it.", "summary": "The National Assembly on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a resolution condemning a recent resolution by the United States House of Representatives while called to probe the February 8 elections.

'I've got no problem with people who want to come here and work,' he tells me, 'and people who really need our help, then we help them, no question.' But his empathy only stretches so far. 'The issue I have is these guys who are turning up, and they have their \u00a3100 mobiles, their \u00a3200 tracksuits. You look at the boats, it's all men. If there's danger [in their home country], they should be staying and fighting to protect their families.' Does he have a preferred solution, I ask. 'I think we should send the Navy out.' I've arrived in Kirkby-in-Ashfield, the former Nottinghamshire pit town, three days after Nigel Farage's dramatic announcement that he's returning as leader of Reform UK, and standing for Parliament, in what he claims has become 'the immigration election'. According to the polls, this is just Farage's normal bombast, with the NHS, cost-of-living and the wider economy easily topping voters' concerns. Then I get talking to Julie, a retired machinist. 'I don't mind if people are here to work,' she insists, 'but all these men in dinghies? We don't need them. But we're paying for them.' We're speaking outside a cafe on the sparsely populated main shopping arcade. She gestures around. 'There's no money for the English, though. Look here. It's empty. Send them back.' Her friend Sandra, a printer, nods. 'We're right, aren't we? You must agree?' she says, almost imploringly. Ashfield has some of the hallmarks of post-industrial Red Wall Britain, with its share of Turkish barbers, nail bars and vaping shops. But it's not an area scarred with obvious depravation. Driving into town along Victoria Road, some of the spacious, detached homes wouldn't be out of place in the southern stockbroker belt. Yet beneath the surface, something is stirring. In the hardware store, I meet Cath. Neatly dressed and softly spoken, she tells me she isn't really into politics. 'I'd normally vote Tory, but not this time. I've got some issues with the Government.' Anything in particular, I enquire. She smiles apologetically. 'Immigration. It's a big problem round here. A lot of families used to go to Skegness for their holidays or the weekend. It's only a couple of hours' drive. But then they started housing the asylum seekers there. A lot of young men just hanging around. My customers have told me they're too scared to go any more.' I've covered a lot of political campaigns, and immigration has frequently been raised. But in the past, people did so a little reluctantly. They would glance over their shoulder and lower their voices for fear of being branded racist. Not any more. In the Nag's Head, Ralph, a former miner, is struggling to fully articulate his frustration. 'I'm sorry, I'm not getting the words right,' he tells me. 'But you have to understand why people are angry. We were told they'd stop the boats, but they haven't.' Clive, a construction worker and old schoolmate of Ralph's, is drinking separately from him. 'The politicians are useless,' he says. 'They've lost control. I was listening on the radio. Starmer and Khan were just shouting at each other, calling each other liars over tax. How's that going to solve anything?' He has inadvertently confused London mayor Sadiq Khan with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Clive's friend Peter concurs. 'Look, let's be honest. We all know there's no chance of this Government doing anything on immigration. We've got a Prime Minister who's Asian. He isn't British.' In fact, Sunak was born in Southampton. Many people will find such views shocking. But they are not being expressed in isolation. Every election has a drumbeat. Last week, I was out with Chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his leafy Surrey constituency. And the same sound is reverberating. From quaint village halls to grimy working men's pubs. The boats. The boats. The boats\u2026 Lee Anderson hears it too. When the election was called, the ex-pit deputy was Reform's sole MP, following his resignation from the Tory Party after claiming Sadiq Khan was being manipulated by 'Islamists'. And one of the reasons for that defection was, he claims, because of the Tories and other established parties' failure to recognise his constituents' immigration concerns. 'The problem is people in Westminster don't come to places like this. I live here. They just think we're a bunch of thick, racist bigots who can hardly string a sentence together, drink bitter, race whippets and have got pigeons in 'us loft,' he says. I'm out with him as he's leafletting on the Mill Lane estate. His mother and father still live here, and he used to watch the men walking up the dirt path to the nearby colliery from his bedroom. The residents of the neat new builds come out and greet him warmly. 'Yep, I'll be voting for you, duck,' says one. I explain to Anderson what I've been hearing around the town. I know his robust views on migration, but is he entirely happy with some of the rhetoric? 'Parliament has let that happen,' he insists. 'We've got to a situation now where people are that p****d off that they're not being listened to, they're using language they wouldn't normally use. They're angry. They're frustrated.' Not that he's averse to some blunt speaking himself. 'A lot of the people you've been talking to round here are struggling to pay their rent and their mortgage. They're having to watch every single penny. Then they switch their TV on at night and they watch 500 illegals coming over, stopping in a four-star hotel. And then these f***s are moaning in these army camps about their conditions.' Britain's political class doesn't want to hear it. But Farage is right. A broken promise to 'take back control' of migration. An undelivered Government pledge to 'stop the boats'. A Government in waiting without a coherent plan to do either. This is the backdrop to what has indeed become The Immigration Election. As I'm driving back to London, Anderson calls. The story of Sunak's D-Day snub is dominating the airwaves. 'Some people don't realise how important this day is,' he says. 'I have grandparents who served. Rishi doesn't. He doesn't have that link.' The drumbeat is getting louder. And if Sunak and Starmer don't respond, on polling day, it will deafen them.", "summary": "Ian, who runs the local butcher's shop, is not without compassion.

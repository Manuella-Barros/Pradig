{"id": 225019178, "title": "Trump\u2019s swampy endorsements won\u2019t make America great again", "text": "If we ever build a D.C. political swamp museum, I will propose that Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho) receive his own, special first-floor exhibit. Despite representing a district that chose Donald Trump by 23 points, Simpson since 1999 has voted for every bill that has made our government what it is today. As a full-spectrum liberal, Simpson is one of the biggest spenders in all of Congress. He is a passionate supporter of DACA amnesty and endless worker visas for illegal aliens. He is a long-time supporter of redefining marriage. And, of course, he has also spoken out against Trump on multiple occasions. If we are ever going to change the uniparty, low-hanging fruit like Mike Simpson must be pruned from the GOP\u2019s androgynous-looking family tree. It\u2019s hard not to notice that Trump\u2019s endorsements of bad incumbents appear to be iron-clad, while his good endorsements are hit-or-miss at best. Yet, shockingly, Trump endorsed Simpson ahead of this week\u2019s primary \u2014 along with nearly every other liberal Republican facing any challenge. It\u2019s no longer about a few ego-driven, wayward endorsements of establishment members. Trump is becoming a defeat mechanism, endorsing every single RINO with a challenger on the horizon. Open seats in solid red states are electing new McConnell-style Republicans with Trump\u2019s help. He is even intervening in state legislatures to undermine the Freedom Caucus\u2019 efforts to transform the party from McConnell Republicans to Trump Republicans, or at least who Trump was perceived as representing. Before Trump\u2019s rise, conservatives struggled to swap out the corrupt, old-guard GOP establishment. It was a vicious cycle of well-known and well-funded incumbents and candidates who would govern in accord with the monied interests and use that superior campaign cash to ingratiate themselves with the conservative base during the primaries. Rewarding enemies, punishing would-be allies What we needed was a force-multiplier who could help candidates who struggle with money and name ID needed to actually get elected and realign the party\u2019s priorities with those of the voters rather than donors. On the surface, Donald Trump was the perfect man for the job. He ran on draining the swamp, being a new type of Republican, and incessantly touted his personal wealth as a shield against undue influence from special interests. He could have endorsed Freedom Caucus-style candidates in every open seat. He might have even endorsed challengers against incumbents. Five cycles into Trump\u2019s dominion over the party, conservative organizations, and conservative media, he easily could have changed the face of the party. Yet, the opposite has occurred. All the people who voted for the budget bills, foreign aid, and FISA reauthorization used to at least sweat a primary challenge even under the unlikely scenario they would lose. Now, they are guaranteed a 100% chance of re-election because they automatically get House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) to call in the endorsement on behalf Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell\u2019s preferred candidates. With few exceptions, Trump has endorsed every single incumbent who has voted for the bad bills, and unless he is pressured to stop, will do so for the remaining primaries. In the past, Trump would butt heads with incumbents who \u201csaid bad things\u201d about him, which would often align with our strategic interests to remove incumbents who were bad on policy. But by backing the likes of Mike Simpson, Trump is now endorsing the worst of the worst \u2014 including past antagonists. This isn\u2019t about reflexively endorsing incumbents, either. In last Tuesday\u2019s primary, Trump endorsed every single liberal Republican in Kentucky and Georgia \u2014 except for Thomas Massie. You might chalk that up to their past disagreements. But in places like Indiana, Trump declined to endorse conservative incumbent Victoria Spartz in her tough battle for re-election, even though she never had a beef with Trump. Meanwhile, Trump endorsed obscure RINO incumbent James Baird in the district next to Spartz\u2019 over a conservative challenger. It\u2019s hard not to notice that Trump\u2019s endorsements of bad incumbents appear to be iron-clad while his good endorsements are hit-or-miss at best. Is Trump making red states more moderate? With Trump refilling the swamp in Congress, the best we can do now may be to build a conservative bulwark in state legislatures to make red states red again. The State Freedom Caucus Network has revolutionized the way we do legislating and primaries in several red states. Nowhere is this more evident than in South Carolina, where the freedom caucus has built an entire parallel movement to challenge the liberal Republicans, many of whom were Democrats until recently. Yet, for the first time, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster and liberal Republicans called in an airstrike and got Trump to reach into the legislative primaries to support most of the incumbents the Freedom Caucus is targeting. The South Carolina Freedom Caucus, ardent allies of Trump, worked assiduously to land primary challengers against GOP leaders who are literally Republicans in name only. Yet Trump endorsed every one of them, including Assistant Majority Leader Jay West, who supported John Kerry and Carla Schussler, who supported Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016. Yes, Trump did back some incumbent Freedom Caucus members, including Thomas Beach, Jay Kilmartin, Mike Burns, and Bill Cumley, but he declined to endorse 10 other incumbent conservatives who face liberal challengers. This includes people like Rob Harris, who supported Trump from day one. It\u2019s always a one-way street with a leftward curve. Now, liberal challengers are sending out mailers claiming these conservative incumbents are so bad Trump wouldn\u2019t even endorse them, which sows confusion when voters most need clarity. When viewed together with Trump\u2019s leftward shift on issues such as abortion, Obamacare, Bud Light, abolishing the FBI, Ukraine war funding, and bailing out Speaker Johnson, these endorsements paint a disturbing picture. The man who claimed his personal wealth would shield him from the left-wing overtures of wayward GOP donors is now so desperate to pay his legal bills that he is willing to give them everything they want. We still have plenty of time before the election. It\u2019s not too late for a course correction.", "summary": "<img src=\"https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/former-u-s-president-donald-trump-speaks-during-a-rally-hosted-by-the-former-president-at-the-delaware-county-fairgrounds-on-ap.jpg?id=52337859&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C9%2C0%2C98\"/><br/><br/><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">If we ever build a D.C. political swamp museum, I will propose that Rep.

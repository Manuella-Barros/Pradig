Dillon, and rookie MarShawn Lloyd. Packers OC Adam Stenavich has praised Lloyd's speed, burst, and vision. The Packers averaged 112.1 rushing yards per game in 2023.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers made a bold move in letting running back Aaron Jones leave the building to sign with the division rival Minnesota Vikings, but now, they have a three-headed backfield that consists of Josh Jacobs, A.J. Dillon, and rookie MarShawn Lloyd.\n\nLloyd, a third-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft out of USC, received some rave reviews at a recent Packers press conference by offensive coordinator Adam Stenavich, who's in his third season as the team's offensive coordinator and has been with the organization since 2019.\n\nRelated Green Bay Packers 2024 NFL Draft: Best Pick, Worst Pick, and Biggest Steal Taking a closer look at the Green Bay Packers 2024 NFL Draft haul. Packers OC Adam Stenavich Loves MarShawn Lloyd The third-year OC likes Lloyd's speed, burst, and vision\n\n\"I liked his speed. I liked his speed a lot,\" Stenavich said of Lloyd. \"He had some good runs in OTAs where you saw his burst. He's got good vision, so I'm really excited about that out of the backfield.\"\n\nStenavich is right to like his speed. Coming out of USC, Lloyd ran a 4.38 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine. However, his biggest issue throughout his college career was staying healthy.\n\nHe played two seasons at South Carolina before transferring to the Trojans in 2023. In three years, he had a total of 289 carries for 1,609 yards and eight touchdowns. At USC in 2023, he had just 115 carries on 156 snaps for 816 yards and nine touchdowns. This was easily his best season, playing in 11 games.\n\nMarShawn Lloyd College Stats\n\nYear\n\nCarries\n\nRush Yards\n\nRush TD\n\nTeam\n\n2021\n\n64\n\n228\n\n1\n\nSouth Carolina\n\n2022\n\n110\n\n565\n\n9\n\nSouth Carolina\n\n2023\n\n115\n\n816\n\n9\n\nUSC\n\nLloyd profiles as an excellent third-down back with Jacobs on the roster and provides the Packers running back depth chart with elements that Dillon cannot.\n\n\"I would like to get (Lloyd) out there as much as possible,\" Stenavich said. \"He's got a skill set that's a little bit different than AJ's as far as his speed. He's not quite the bruiser that (Dillon) is, obviously, but he's got a different type of skill set. So it'll be nice to get him the ball in space and just see what he can do because I think he's gonna add a good explosive element to the offense as well.\"\n\nIn 2023, the Packers, who were forced to deal with injuries to Jones throughout much of the year, ranked 15th in rushing yards per game at 112.1. Over their final three regular-season games, however, they averaged 154.3 yards. They were weirdly also much better on the road, with 123.3 yards per game as opposed to an average of just 99.4 at Lambeau Field.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat: Marshawn Lloyd tallied 47 missed tackles and had 14 15-plus-yard runs in 2023 at USC.\n\nThis new rushing attack, coupled with another year of Jordan Love starting under center, could create a young and explosive Packers offense. That said, Stenavich is asking everyone to pump the brakes a little bit, saying, \"No one's going to hand anything to us in this league.\"\n\n\"We know how good we can be, but we need to understand that no one's going to hand anything to us in this league,\" Stenavich said. \"Everything must be earned. Just the (intentionality) of going out there every single day and working hard and working at your craft and being the best that you can be, that's what's going to take us back to the playoffs and get us as far as we can go.\"\n\nStatistics courtesy of Pro Football Reference unless stated otherwise.\n\nRelated Ranking the Top 5 Green Bay Packers Quarterbacks of All Time Between Bart Starr, Brett Favre, and Aaron Rodgers, who's the best Green Bay Packers quarterback of all time?", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MarShawn_Lloyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MarShawn Lloyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Stenavich", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Stenavich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Jones_(running_back)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Jones (running back)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40-yard_dash", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "40-yard dash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bart Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-Football-Reference.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro-Football-Reference.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Favre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brett Favre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambeau_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lambeau Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/marshawn-lloyd.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547621", "eventUri": "eng-9547621", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

After that, how the remaining snaps shake out is still an unknown, but third-round pick Marshawn Lloyd is going to factor in heavily to the Packers game plans.\n\nThe last time the Packers used an early-round pick on a running back was when they took AJ Dillon in the second round of the 2020 NFL draft. Although circumstances were a bit different with the Packers already having Aaron Jones and Jamaal Williams on the roster, Dillon had only 55 rushing attempts as a rookie.\n\nHowever, it doesn't sound like that is the approach that the Packers are going to take with Lloyd: [affiliatewidget_smgtolocal]\n\n\"I would like to get him out there as much as possible,\" said offensive coordinator Adam Stenavich. \"He's got a skill set that's a little bit different than AJ's as far as his speed.

I think he's gonna add a good explosive element to the offense, for sure.\"\n\nAlong with Stenavich, Matt LaFleur has also pointed out that Lloyd's burst and ability in space brings a different element to the Packers' offense. LaFleur sees Lloyd as being a 'matchup nightmare' out of the backfield.\n\nLloyd measures in at 5-9 - 220 pounds but has shown an impressive ability to make defenders miss. At the NFL combine, Lloyd ran a 4.46-second 40 while also putting up 25 reps on the bench press-illustrating both the speed and strength he possesses.\n\nDuring his 2023 season at USC, Lloyd averaged an impressive 7.1 yards per carry and a whopping 17.8 yards per reception, showcasing the ability that he has with the ball in his hands. And out of 200 eligible running backs. Lloyd ranked 26th in average yards after contact.\n\n\"I liked his speed,\" added Stenavich. \"I liked his speed a lot. He had some good runs in OTAs where you saw his burst. He's got good vision. So I'm really excited about that out of the backfield.\"\n\nAlong with Lloyd, the Packers also have Dillon and Emanuel Wilson on the roster, both of whom will presumably be fighting for a roster spot and some touches.\n\nDillon brings reliability to the position in all aspects, including as a pass catcher and in pass protection. However, he lacked playmaking, averaging only 3.4 yards per carry in 2023.\n\nWilson, in his limited attempts, showcased good burst with the ball, averaging 4.7 yards per rush, but he remains a relative unknown in terms of what the Packers can expect from him.\n\nPrior to the draft, it felt like the competition for the backup running back role behind Jacobs was going to be one of the bigger camp battles to take place. However, as of now, with the Packers clearly wanting to get Lloyd on the field, the bigger question might be who is RB3 and who is left off the roster?\n\n\"He's got serious speed,\" said GM Brian Gutekunst about Lloyd. \"He's very elusive, he's got great balance, so he's a little bit different than some of the backs that we have in our depth chart right now.\"", "source": {"uri": "packerswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Packers Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_bretl@packerswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Paul Bretl", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaal_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaal Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Jones_(running_back)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Jones (running back)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_LaFleur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt LaFleur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Gutekunst", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Gutekunst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://packerswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/57/2024/04/USATSI_21602482.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547621", "eventUri": "eng-9547621", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

And MarShawn Lloyd may be the most interesting of them all.\n\nWith the Packers in the midst of rookie mini camp, offensive coordinator Adam Stenavich is creating ways to get Lloyd on the field. Running back already is crowded with A.J. Dillion and newly signed Josh Jacobs. Green Bay then drafted Lloyd in the third round of last month's NFL Draft. He was the fourth running back off the board and one of three to go in the third round.\n\n\"I would like to get him out there as much as possible,\" Stenavich told reporters this week. \"He's got a skill set that's a little bit different than AJ's, as far as his speed... It'll be nice to get him the ball in space and just see what he can do, 'cause I think he's gonna add a good explosive element to the offense, for sure.\"\n\n\"I liked his speed. I liked his speed a lot,\" Stenavich said of Lloyd. \"He had some good runs in OTAs where you saw his burst. He's got good vision, so I'm really excited about that out of the backfield.\"\n\nThis wasn't the draft year for the true elite backs. Jonathon Brooks, the former Texas Longhorn, was the first back off the board. His ACL tear back in November dropped him out of the first round conservation. That's why the Panthers could land him 14 picks into the second round. Three backs, including Lloyd, were third rounders. Daniel Jeremiah, the top draft analyst for NFL Network, rated Lloyd as his top running back.\n\nMeanwhile, there were several big name, experienced backs who switched teams with free agency. The Packers were major players in the running back market. They signed Josh Jacobs, the 2022 NFL rushing king, in free agency. And Green Bay also released fan favorite Aaron Jones. He signed with Vikings, an NFC North foe. However, Dillon still is around Lambeau Field.\n\nIn this scenario, Jacobs is the starter. The Packers made him one of the highest-paid running backs in the NFL. He signed a four-year deal worth $48 million. And he's set to earn about $15 million in 2024.\n\n\"Josh is a phenomenal running back,\" Stenavich said. \"He's been All-Pro a couple of times. He's just one of those guys that's good in all situations, good out of the backfield as a receiver, excellent runner. (And) he's a good [pass] protector. So he's one of those guys that you can really have in the game all the time and not have to worry about anything with him. So that's nice.\"\n\nOverall, the Packers could be fielding one of the top offenses in the league. Jordan Love and the young receivers have excellent chemistry. And the running backs have talent.\n\n\"We know how good we can be,\" says the Packers offensive coordinator. \"But we need to understand that no one's going to hand anything to us in this league.

Prior to Green Bay taking him, there was a good chance that Lloyd almost landed with two other teams instead of the Packers.\n\nLloyd thought one team that could have drafted him was the Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys had the pick before the Packers took Lloyd at No. 87, but instead selected Notre Dame linebacker Marist Liufau. Given the pre-draft interest the Cowboys had shown in Lloyd and the team losing their top running back Tony Pollard this season, it would not have been surprising to see them go with Lloyd at No. 87, via ESPN's Jeremy Fowler.\n\nCowboys' NFC East rival, the New York Giants, also had interest in Lloyd. Like Dallas, New York lost their top running back in Saquon Barkley, who went to the Philadelphia Eagles. However, the Giants were unable to pull off acquiring Lloyd since they didn't have a pick later in the third round, per Fowler. They did have an early third round pick, but they drafted cornerback Andru Phillips at No. 70 overall.\n\nInstead, Lloyd will join the Packers where he will team up with former Las Vegas Raiders running back Josh Jacobs and A.J. Dillon in the backfield. Jacobs will likely take on the role as lead back since he is the more experienced NFL veteran. Lloyd certainly should have a place in the running game and offense though, and could provide a nice change of pace back for the Packers.\n\nPackers offensive coordinator Adam Stenavich spoke on how he sees this backfield working out, calling Jacobs someone they can have in the game all the time. Still, he added that he wants to get Lloyd on the field as well.\n\n\"I would like to get (Lloyd) out there as much as possible,\" Stenavich said, via NFL.com's Eric Edholm. \"He's got a skill set that's a little bit different than AJ's as far as his speed. He's not quite the bruiser that (Dillon) is obviously, but he's got a different type of skill set. So it'll be nice to get him the ball in space and just see what he can do because I think he's gonna add a good explosive element to the offense as well.\"\n\nLloyd might not get regular targets with Dillon and Jacobs also there, but he can certainly provide that 'explosive element.' Lloyd ran a 4.38 40-yard dash at the company and averaged 7.1 yards per carry in his final season at USC. With Lloyd also working on his pass-catching ability through the pre-draft process, he has the skills to give the Packers another element to their backfield.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Pollard_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tony Pollard (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marist_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marist College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Notre Dame Fighting Irish football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFC East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saquon_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saquon Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40-yard_dash", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "40-yard dash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5876,h_3305,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_trojans/01hxct3cyadsq016zmpa.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547621", "eventUri": "eng-9547621", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

I'm really excited about that out of the backfield,\" Stenavich said Monday.\n\nLloyd, the 88th overall pick, ran the 40-yard dash in 4.46 seconds at 220 pounds. Following the draft, general manager Brian Gutekunst said Lloyd has \"serious speed\" with the elusiveness and contact balance for breaking tackles, something he did often at South Carolina and USC. [affiliatewidget_smgtolocal]\n\nLloyd's burst and shiftiness at 220 pounds are traits that make him a fascinating running back prospect for the Packers. In terms of \"Speed Score,\" or a measure of a prospect's weight and 40-yard dash time, Lloyd ranked fourth among running backs in the draft class. Only Lloyd and Isaac Geurendo weighed at least 220 pounds and ran the 40-yard dash in under 4.5 seconds.\n\nWhile the Packers signed veteran Josh Jacobs and brought back A.J. Dillon, Stenavich said he wants Lloyd and his explosiveness on the field right away as a rookie.\n\n\"I would like to get him out there as much as possible,\" Stenavich said. \"He's got a skill set that's different than A.J. as far as his speed.

I think he'll add a good explosive element to the offense.\"\n\nLloyd's pass-catching potential could be another avenue for getting him on the field and the ball in his hands. He caught only 34 passes during his collegiate career but was consistently dangerous as a receiver, and the Packers loved the way he attacked 1-on-1s during the Senior Bowl.\n\n\"He definitely can be a weapon out of the backfield,\" said coach Matt LaFleur. \"I love all the measurables. He's a 220-pound back that runs 4.4 and can run routes out of the backfield.

Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe NFL draft is over, and many NFL teams added some elite prospects in the process. Some of these elite prospects are USC Trojans, and many of them, drafted or undrafted, have found a new home. One former Trojan who could make an impact right out of the gate is running back MarShawn Lloyd.\n\nLloyd was selected on Day 2 in the third round with the No. 88 overall pick by the Green Bay Packers. The Packers, in need of a running back after parting ways with their Pro Bowl running back Aaron Jones, have placed their faith in Lloyd. They envision him not only as a replacement for Jones in 2024 but also as a player who could emulate Jones' success.\n\nESPN's Jeremey Fowler reported in his latest NFL post-draft piece.\n\n\"The Packers definitely see shades of Aaron Jones in USC back MarShawn Lloyd, their third-round pick, with his versatility, burst, toughness and ability to catch the ball out of the backfield,\" Fowler said. \"Despite the presence of Josh Jacobs and AJ Dillon in the backfield (accounting for nearly $16 million in combined 2024 payroll, by the way), the Packers should get Lloyd acclimated quickly. I'm told Lloyd doesn't consider himself a stash-and-learn option but a real player in the backfield, based on his talks with the team. And GreenBay will remain dedicated to the run. The Packers went 5-0 when Jones, now a Viking, rushed 20 or more times.\"\n\nJones left for the rival Minnesota Vikings during free agency, and now Lloyd could be the lead back in the Packers backfield.\n\nThe 23-year-old back showed his prowess in his lone season at USC. His 2023 season was his best in college as he attempted 116 rushes for 820 yards and was a threat as a pass catcher, collecting 13 receptions for 232 yards and an average of 17.8 yards per reception. When it comes to his dual-threat abilities, the Jones' comparisons are fair.\n\nThe Delaware native has all the tools to be a successful back in the NFL. He is an exceptional athlete with great acceleration and a burst, impressive stop-/start acceleration, and good contact balance and strength on his runs.\n\nThe Packers could pick up right where they left off with an even younger version of Jones.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MarShawn_Lloyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MarShawn Lloyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Jones_(running_back)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Jones (running back)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rush (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4939,h_2778,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_trojans/01hxcredc9ws6h9nhddv.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547621", "eventUri": "eng-9547621", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

He's just one of those guys that's good in all situations -- good out of the backfield as a receiver, excellent runner, he's a good protector -- so he's one of those guys that you can really have in the game all the time and not have to worry about anything with him, so that's nice. And just his experience, his leadership, things like that, I'm excited about having him here and doing a great job for us.\"\n\nA first-round draft pick from Alabama in 2019, Jacobs ran for 5,545 yards and 46 touchdowns on 1,305 carries and caught 197 receptions for 1,448 yards during five seasons with the Oakland/Las Vegas Raiders. He led the NFL with 1,653 rushing yards and 2,053 scrimmage yards in 2022. In 2023, Jacobs had 805 yards and six touchdowns on 233 carries and 37 receptions for 296 yards after a contract impasse caused him to miss almost all of the Raiders' preseason preparations and an injury sidelined him for the final four games of the season.\n\nJacobs joined Green Bay in free agency for a four-year, $48 million contract that included a $12.5 million signing bonus, which is the guaranteed portion of the contract.\n\nGreen Bay special-teams coordinator Rich Bisaccia served in that post with the Raiders when Jacobs entered the NFL, and he became Las Vegas' interim head coach for the final 12 games of the 2021 season.\n\nWhen he signed, Jacobs said his \"tight relationship\" with Bisaccia was among the factors leading him to Green Bay.\n\n\"He's a unique personality\" Bisaccia said on Thursday. \"He's extremely bright. He's had so much adversity, as we all know about, in his young life that things that happen on the football field don't ever seem to amount to being a big deal to him. He's learned to deal with adversity and overcome those sort of things both in his personal life and certainly what he does on the football field. He's a bright light personality-wise. He loves football, and it shows in his actions, so we're certainly excited he's a part of what we're trying to do now.\"\n\nAfter running a 4.38-second 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine, Lloyd offers a different element for the Green Bay backfield, just as Dillon does at 247 pounds.\n\n\"I liked his speed a lot,\" Stenavich said about Lloyd after seeing him at rookie minicamp over the weekend. \"He had some good runs in OTAs where you saw his burst. He's got good vision, so I'm really excited about that out of the backfield. ...\n\n\"I would like to get him out there as much as possible. I think he's got a skill set that's a little bit different than A.J.'s as far as his speed. He's not quite the bruiser that (Dillon) is, obviously, but he's got a different type of skill set, so it'll be nice to get him the ball in space and just see what he can do because I think he's going to add a good explosive element to the offense for sure.\"\n\nFOR MORE OF AL.COM'S COVERAGE OF THE NFL, GO TO OUR NFL PAGE", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "al"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Jones_(running_back)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Jones (running back)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_bonus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Signing bonus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Bisaccia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rich Bisaccia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birmingham_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Birmingham News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40-yard_dash", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "40-yard dash"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/KXFT3GA5RNFCNG3LOQ4XZPGVU4.jpg?auth=bdddc35f0888222167a652ed1ec2a151517d691e5fd53e8595517128260ef19b&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547621", "eventUri": "eng-9547621", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 157, "textEnd": 165}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

However, ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported that the Dallas Cowboys were also interested in the USC prospect.\n\n\"Dallas had shown enough pre-draft love to MarShawn Lloyd that the USC tailback (who went to Green Bay at No. 88) thought the Cowboys would be one of the possible teams to draft him,\" Fowler reported.\n\nThe Cowboys weren't the only other team interested in Lloyd, either.\n\n\"Like Dallas...[the New York Giants] also had [their] sights on USC running back MarShawn Lloyd as a future lead back but didn't have a pick between Nos. 71 and 107,\" Fowler wrote.\n\nIt seems that Lloyd was a hot commodity, but the Packers were able to get him before another team could.\n\nHe may not have been the first RB off the board, but Lloyd brings an exciting skill set.\n\nLloyd was one of the top high school running backs in the country in 2020. A 4-star recruit, he had offers from programs like Alabama and Notre Dame. Instead, he decided to initially enroll at South Carolina.\n\nAfter a few seasons with the Gamecocks, Lloyd transferred to USC before 2023. He had a terrifically efficient season for the Trojans, averaging 7.1 yards per carry with 820 yards and nine touchdowns.\n\nOn film, Lloyd is a unique prospect. He's a home-run hitter with excellent burst, but also the motor to keep his feet moving through contact. He also presents a unique athletic profile at just 5'8'' and 220 pounds. His Relative Athletic Score of 8.62 was also very good.\n\nDespite all of the things to like about Lloyd, there are some concerns. His 8.75-inch hands might be a big reason for his fumble issues, which included eight over three seasons.\n\nStill, Lloyd's big-play ability makes him the perfect change-of-pace back in Green Bay's running back room.\n\nAfter taking Lloyd in the third round, the Packers have some decent depth in their running back room.\n\nJosh Jacobs will be the go-to starter this season. The Packers signed him to a four-year, $48 million contract at the start of free agency. While he's coming off a disappointing 2023 season, he was the NFL's leading rusher in 2022 with 1,653 yards and is only 26 years old.\n\nThe real competition in training camp will be who gets the third-string carries behind Jacobs and Lloyd. AJ Dillon could be that third back, but is coming off the worst year of his career. He was disappointing in short-yardage situations, and averaged a career-low 3.4 yards per carry.\n\nUndrafted free agent Emmanuel Wilson could still be an option.

Dillon.\n\n\"Not only with his rushing ability but his ability to catch passes out of the backfield,\" Fowler said of Lloyd with regards to his similarities to Jones, per Joseph Zucker of Bleacher Report. \"So, the expectation is they're going to get him acclimated pretty early, try to use him a lot.\"\n\nZucker also noted an X post from Derek Brown of FantasyPros and BettingPros that detailed the Packers' ability to extricate themselves from Jacobs' contract after the 2024 campaign.\n\n\"The Packers can move on from Josh Jacobs next year if he doesn't bounce back with a $9.3 [million] dead cap,\" Brown wrote. \"So naw, I'm not as worried about MarShawn Lloyd as others.\"\n\nTechnically, the Packers will incur a dead cap hit of $9.375 million in 2025 if they terminate Jacobs' four-year, $48 million contract after just one season, but the point is that Green Bay doesn't have to throw good money after bad should Jacobs fail to return to his All-Pro form of 2022.\n\nJacobs bet on himself by accepting a deal that includes just $12.5 million in fully guaranteed money, and if he plays like a top-five running back in 2024 (his salary is the fifth-highest at the position league-wide heading into the season) then the organization isn't likely to send him packing. And if it does, he'll find a comfortable and lucrative home elsewhere at some point during the offseason.\n\nAs a former first-round pick of the Las Vegas Raiders, Jacobs earned Pro Bowl honors in his second and fourth NFL seasons (2020, 2022), as well as a first-team All-Pro selection in 2022. He led the league in rushing that year with 1,653 yards and added 12 TDs on the ground. Jacobs also caught 53 passes for a career-high 400 receiving yards that season, per Pro Football Reference.\n\nHowever, injuries hampered Jacobs in 2023. He played in just 13 of 17 regular-season games, amassing a career-low 805 rushing yards. He was still able to score 6 TDs and hauled in 37 receptions for 296 yards through the air.\n\nThe problem for Jacobs is that Lloyd doesn't even have to outplay him to render Jacobs expendable. All he has to do is be good enough that the expected production-to-cost ratio is high enough for the Packers to justify moving on from Jacobs for the far less expensive Lloyd -- even if that means a step back in overall talent at the position.\n\nLloyd, the 88th overall pick, hasn't signed a contract with Green Bay yet, though Spotrac projects his value at just shy of $5.7 million total over the standard four-year rookie deal. That equates to just over $1.42 million per season.\n\nThe Packers are likely on the verge of paying quarterback Jordan Love something in the neighborhood of $45-$50 million annually over a new multiyear contract, which could come this offseason or potentially the next. Love is currently set to play the 2024 season on a one-year deal worth $13.5 million guaranteed that could hit $22.5 million with incentives, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nThe rest of the offensive roster, including a cache of high-level pass-catchers, are among the youngest in the NFL and playing predominantly on cheap rookie deals. Those financial circumstances will allow Green Bay to award Love with a massive new deal, just as they allowed the franchise to dangle nearly $50 million in front of Jacobs, despite the continued devaluation of the RB position across the league in recent years.\n\nThat said, the Packers won't continue to pay Jacobs huge money if they don't have to, unless he makes huge contributions. And even in that scenario, if Lloyd's production projects to end up somewhere in the ballpark of Jacobs', the team might still part with Jacobs early in the interest of saving money.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_dible@heavy.com", "name": "Max Dible", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Jones_(running_back)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Jones (running back)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-Football-Reference.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro-Football-Reference.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Love", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2151363818_b9c8ea-e1715138750983.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547621", "eventUri": "eng-9547621", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Their most-tenured pass-catchers were Romeo Doubs, Christian Watson and Samori Toure. All three had a whopping one season under their belts.\n\nCoaching a roster that young was a challenge, and the Packers felt the growing pains early.\n\nRodgers' successor, Jordan Love, and the rest of the offense had a bumpy ride to start the season.\n\nLove was toward the top of the leaderboard in interceptions and, with the team floundering at 3-6, there were some questions as to whether this experiment would turn into a one-and-done experience.\n\nInstead, Love and the offense found its footing down the stretch, punctuated by a 48-32 rout of the Dallas Cowboys in their playoff debut.\n\nTheir finish, along with a new attitude on the defensive side of the ball, has the Packers on the short list of favorites at FanDuel Sportsbook to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl.\n\nThis offseason is similar in nature to the offseason prior to the 2020 season.\n\nIn Matt LaFleur's first season as coach in 2019, the Packers surprised everyone on their way to a 13-3 record. While they reached the NFC Championship Game, the offense struggled. Rodgers threw 26 touchdowns to just two interceptions, but the offense performed inconsistently.\n\nThe 2020 season was different.\n\nRodgers, perhaps spurred by the selection of Love, had one of the best seasons of his career en route to winning NFL MVP. The offense, which returned all its key performers, blew through opposing defenses to become one of the best in football. The Packers came within five points of representing the NFC in the Super Bowl.\n\nFast forward to now, the Packers are in a similar boat.\n\nThey return eight of their 11 opening-day starters, with Jon Runyan, David Bakhtiari and Aaron Jones the exceptions.\n\nThe Packers have a built-in replacement for Bakhtiari, with Rasheed Walker starting 17 games (including playoffs) after Bakhtiari was unable to play after Week 1. Former All-Pro Josh Jacobs was signed to replace Jones. All their top pass-catchers are back and have a year of experience in LaFleur's offense and catching passes from Love.\n\nInstead of thinking, they'll be able to react.\n\n\"Oh, it's night and day. Night and day because last year, going into the draft, we had maybe three receivers on the roster. We had two tight ends,\" offensive coordinator Adam Stenavich said on Monday.\n\n\"It was just one of those things where you didn't really know what direction you could go yet because you didn't really know who was going to be on your team and what skill-set they had. Even going into camp and going into the season, it was the same deal like, how much can you put on these guys' plates and allow them to go out and execute? So, now everyone has a year under their belt, so to speak. It's been great to just know what these guys are good at, what they need to improve on and just allow them to just go ahead and be the best players that they can be.\"\n\nWith that, the offense should be poised to get off to a fast start for the 2024 season.\n\nInstead of having to be slowly brought along, LaFleur should be able to dig deeper into his play sheet and build on things as early as this offseason.\n\n\"You're always looking to take the next step. You have to keep evolving, so it's just a matter of what's our best next step or next two things that we want to do.\" Stenavich said.\n\n\"That's the thing we can work on now. It's not just running the foundational base things, but now we can just, 'All right, let's see how this looks,' maybe get this guy the ball in a certain way, whatever it is, a certain package with particular players on the field, just stuff like that where you can see, 'All right, is this the direction we want to go.'\"\n\nThat direction, and that difference, could give the Packers an early edge in what should be a fiercely competitive NFC North.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Love", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_LaFleur", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matt LaFleur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samori_Toure_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samori Toure (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Watson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_Doubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romeo Doubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Journal_Sentinel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasheed_Walker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rasheed Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Jones_(running_back)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Jones (running back)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bakhtiari", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Bakhtiari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4887,h_2748,x_0,y_52/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/packer_central/01hxdd8jgznvrkf088gm.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547621", "eventUri": "eng-9547621", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Here are the highlights from the Green Bay Packers special teams coordinator:\n\nPackers committed to three-man competition at kicker\n\nAnders Carlson's missed field goal from 41 yards with 6 minutes, 21 seconds left in the fourth quarter at San Francisco was no small piece to the premature end last season. It was his fifth straight game missing a kick, either a field goal or extra point, and 10th in his final 12.\n\nHis miss against the 49ers especially resonated. The three points would have given the Packers a touchdown lead late in the fourth quarter of their NFC divisional round playoff loss, allowing them to play for overtime after 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey's ensuing touchdown. Instead, it became the difference in the final score.\n\n\"I just think his response has been work,\" Bisaccia said. \"It was that way during the year last year. He went through some of the ebbs and flows of kicks. I think he's really been the same way. He's come back a little bit stronger in the offseason than he was, I think, a year ago.\"\n\nA stronger leg would be intriguing, considering Carlson did not lack for distance last year. Accuracy was another matter. The Packers responded to Carlson's rookie woes by creating a three-man competition for kicker this offseason, adding veteran Greg Joseph and rookie Jack Podlesny.\n\nThree kickers is more than teams typically carry, even on their offseason roster, but Bisaccia said he's still maintained head-to-head competition under a weekly rotating 2-1 format. If two kickers compete head to head one day, the third would get to kick all the reps the next. After a week, one of the two kickers going head to head replaces his teammate taking all the reps. They've kicked both inside the Don Hutson center and outside, even in Thursday's blustery conditions.\n\n\"I think the reactions have been good,\" Bisaccia said. \"It's all on film. It's all being graded. They know they're in a competition. I think they can feel that amongst themselves every day in practice, and it's been good conversation.\"\n\nThe decision on whether to continue carrying three kickers through training camp is general manager Brian Gutekunst's, but Bisaccia said he's determined to keep a competitive environment for the job. Regardless of who kicks this fall, he knows the Packers can't have a repeat of last season's gluttony of misses.\n\n\"It might be those three,\" Bisaccia said. \"It might be three other ones. I don't know. It might be six. But we're appreciative, certainly, of Brian getting it to the point we have now of a three-man competition, and we'll see how long we can keep that going.\n\n\"We're going to keep investigating to try to end up with the best player we possibly can.\"\n\nBisaccia had input on Packers voting against kickoff rule changes, but pleased the play remains\n\nIn what amounts to common sense, Bisaccia had significant input in the Packers becoming one of only three NFL teams to vote against the league's new kickoff rules.\n\nBisaccia said he had \"a lot of conversations\" with president/CEO Mark Murphy and coach Matt LaFleur before Murphy ultimately casted the \"no\" vote. That the Packers would vote against rule changes designed to save the play's potential extinction was surprising, considering the presence of two-time-defending All-Pro kick returner Keisean Nixon on their roster.\n\nBisaccia said he preferred to see the rule changes tested in the preseason before introducing such a \"radical\" shift in games that count.\n\n\"I was really excited and proud,\" Bisaccia said, \"to be a part of Mark Murphy and Matt LaFleur voting no from the perspective that I have as a special teams coach for a long time. So I was excited for that. We had a lot of conversations about it, them going into the meeting.\"\n\nNow that the rule change has passed, Bisaccia described complex feelings about it. He expressed love for the traditional kickoff, both the play itself and the opportunities it provided for players on the bottom of the 53-man roster. Bisaccia also knows dwelling on the past isn't going to be much of a benefit now.\n\n\"I am excited about the new part,\" Bisaccia said. \"Because it's just a part of our personality. I am glad that the play is still in the game, right? That we're not losing the play, so hopefully we're not going to lose those players, and you're not going to lose your livelihood as a coach.\n\n\"So I am excited about the play, and it's radical. So let's see how good we all are, right? We're all doing the same thing, and let's see how it's going to look like as time goes on.\"\n\nRe-signing Keisean Nixon 'exciting' for Packers special teams\n\nFor the Packers, nothing is better about the NFL retaining the kickoff in its game than having Nixon as their returner. Bisaccia said he was pleased to see the Packers re-sign the two-time All-Pro this spring.\n\n\"I think it's exciting not only for him but for the organization,\" Bisaccia said, \"to get a guy who's done what he's done in the last two years and become the player he's become. He's matured certainly as a person, and his role on defense seems to be increasing each year.\n\n\"I know he's in great shape. I know his hand, he went through that, and that's getting better. So I think we're looking forward to him hopefully having another good year, and I know the new defensive coaches like the way he works as well.\"\n\nFormer Wisconsin long snapper Peter Bowden has 'opportunity in future to compete and play in the league'\n\nBisaccia was pleased with veteran long snapper Matt Orzech's first season with the Packers, but it didn't stop Gutekunst from adding competition at the position.\n\nThe Packers signed rookie Peter Bowden after the draft. Bowden is their lone player from the University of Wisconsin to crack the offseason roster.\n\n\"We've done a lot of work on him,\" Bisaccia said. \"We like Peter. I thought he did pretty good. He's got good size, he's athletic, he can move his feet. He's working on the velocity of his snap, but I do think he's going to have a chance and have an opportunity in the future to compete and play in the league.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen if that opportunity will come with the Packers.\n\nMore: Rookie MarShawn Lloyd can help right away if he cures fumbling problem, other takeaways from Packers coaches\n\n\"We've had a bunch who've come through our training camp two years in a row that are playing on another team, or one year and are playing on another team,\" Bisaccia said. \"So that's another position you'd like to, there's not a lot of them out there. Especially now with the size that can compete and protect those A gaps. So we're excited about him being around Matt. I think Matt's really good. Thought he had a good year. He's also improved, and he's gotten stronger. He's played in a lot of good games, he's won a Super Bowl.\n\n\"So hopefully he'll be a guy who can set the example for what that's supposed to look like as well.\"", "source": {"uri": "jsonline.com",

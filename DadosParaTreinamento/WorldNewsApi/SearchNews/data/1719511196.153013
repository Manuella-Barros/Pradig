{"id": 223748336, "title": "F1: Charles Leclerc finally realises Monaco destiny after massive Sergio Perez crash", "text": "Under the blazing Mediterranean sunshine and crisp blue skies on this most prestigious of racing Sundays, this famed principality\u2019s prodigal son finally realised his day of days. Charles Leclerc\u2019s procession started long before the chequered flag; in fact, from lap one\u2019s crash chaos and red flag, this grand prix victory could hardly have been simpler. No pit-stops. No incidents. No Ferrari meltdown. The curse is well and truly over. Of course, by the curse, we mean that Leclerc \u2013 the Monegasque star who has never claimed a podium at his home race, let alone a win \u2013 had been here before. Pole positions in 2021 and 2022 were butchered by a drive shaft issue and strategy blunder but 2024 felt like his year from practice on Friday. Armed with the quickest car, Leclerc has been rapid all weekend and his victory felt somewhat pencilled in after topping qualifying on Saturday. On raceday, a dramatic first-lap pile-up at the back involving Sergio Perez and the Haas pairing of Kevin Magnussen and Nico Hulkenberg triggered an early stoppage. It allowed the whole field to fulfil their mandatory pit-stop, with the front four all switching to the long-lasting hard tyre. And, despite seeing second-placed Oscar Piastri in his wing mirrors throughout most of the remaining 77 laps, nobody was taking this triumph away from Leclerc on this occasion. It has been 93 years since Monaco\u2019s most famous day basked in the sweetness and satisfaction of a homegrown winner. That goes back to pre-Formula 1 days and Louis Chiron \u2013 a dancer-turn-driver in-between the two world wars \u2013 carried that honour for so long. Now though, at long last, Leclerc stood grandly in the middle of the royal box with Monaco\u2019s national anthem, Hymne Monegasque, belting out. He received the first-place trophy from Prince Albert \u2013 and a warm embrace. The 26-year-old was emotional, uncharacteristically so, on his team radio on his victory lap. His first win in 22 months comes on the streets of Monte-Carlo where he grew up, dreaming of such a day. It is, unquestionably after six years, his proudest day in Formula 1. \u201cI think twice that I\u2019ve started on pole position and couldn\u2019t make it, makes it better of course,\u201d he said afterwards. \u201cIt was a difficult race emotionally. I was thinking of my Dad a lot more when I was driving, he was giving everything for me to be here. It was a dream of ours.\u201d Overtakes at the start heading into turn-one Saint-Devote are not common and so it proved here. Leclerc got off the start-line comfortably, taking the inside line to swoop into a lead he held for the next two-and-a-half hours. Piastri got his elbows out to fend off Carlos Sainz in third, who sustained damage to his tyre and crashed at the top of the hill. But the real drama occurred at the back of the pack. Magnussen \u2013 one incident away from a race ban which may well now come his way for the next race in Canada \u2013 thought he saw a gap on the right steaming up the hill. He didn\u2019t. Perez, who only has himself to blame after qualifying a dismal 18th on Saturday, has his rear-right wheel clipped and was left spinning and smashing into the barrier, collecting Magnussen and Hulkenberg with him. His wheels flew off onto the pavement and his car was completely smashed up. All three drivers escaped unharmed but with the circuit covered in debris, the stewards threw red \u2013 and suspended the race for just over 30 minutes. It is a peculiarity of the F1 rulebook that a red flag allows drivers to change tyres and, here, it rendered the rest of the race largely irrelevant. Once Leclerc got off the line smoothly again, he kept his cool and composure despite Piastri\u2019s presence on his gearbox. It is near-impossible to overtake at Monaco and this year confirmed it: for the remaining 77 laps after the red flag, there was not one overtake in the top-10 and for the first time in F1\u2019s 74-year history, the top-10 did not alter from the starting grid to the finish line. Leclerc, who occupied the podium with team-mate Sainz on a brilliant day for Ferrari, has made up some ground this season too. The gap to championship leader Max Verstappen \u2013 finishing in sixth, his worst position since November 2022 \u2013 has been cut from 48 points to 31 points. Beyond the parties aboard the yachts in the harbour tonight, as F1 heads to Canada in a fortnight\u2019s time, maybe we do have a title race on our hands after all.", "summary": "Leclerc kept McLaren\u2019s Oscar Piastri at bay to take his first victory on home soil.", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/f1/charles-leclerc-f1-monaco-grand-prix-piastri-sainz-b2551813.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/26/16/GettyImages-2154744470.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Qwd5IhBf-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:52:39", "author": "Kieran Jackson,Philip Duncan", "authors": ["Kieran Jackson", "Philip Duncan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.168}

As \"Suffs\" shows, she was incarcerated for her activism and force fed while behind bars.\n\n\"I think this will help people understand that was maybe the most militant period of feminist history,\" said Molly Gonzales, the Paul Institute's advocacy manager.\n\nPaul died at 92 in a Moorestown nursing home and is buried in Cinnaminson. That she didn't live to see the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment was a disappointment she took to her grave.\n\nBut the ERA has now been ratified by the necessary 38 states. Activists around the country like members of the Young Feminist Party and supporters in Congress' ERA Caucus are working to make it a law, said Gonzales. That includes the Alice Paul Institute, which provides information about the ERA on its website.\n\nAfter the performance last week, the institute was one of the sponsors of ERA Night, a program at the theater that included a panel discussion with second-wave feminism leader and journalist Gloria Steinem.\n\n\"It was so wonderful to hear Gloria Steinem speak,\" said Lydia Smith, 17, of Moorestown. \"We had an unexpected opportunity to meet her before the musical, which was absolutely amazing. It was such an honor.\"\n\nIn their monthly meetings, the Girls Leadership Council members discuss issues facing women in the country and the world. Over the past two years, they've tackled period poverty, creating and stocking a feminine hygiene products pantry at the Cherry Hill Library.\n\n\"They've already seen a difference in their period pantry,\" said Quincy Wansel, institute youth program coordinator. \"That's one library in one town, but it's helped over 300 community members. That makes them feel great, and it should. Even if it helps just one person, that's making a difference in the world.\"\n\nBeing at \"Suffs\" made the young theatergoers feel they were already part of something bigger than themselves, especially as their fellow audience members cheered the suffragists, booed the men who stood in their way and laughed at the play's jokes.\n\n\"There were definitely key moments in the play that I really felt inspired by. I got goosebumps,\" said Salmah Khalil, 18, who started a feminists club at her school, Cherry Hill West. \"Specifically when they were going on that march on Washington. It was very inspiring because it's not as recognized, but there was major change because of that. It was almost like I was in the march when I was watching it happen.\"\n\nKennedy Dancy, 17, of Mount Laurel said she enjoyed seeing so many men in the audience enjoying the play.\n\n\"Just seeing men in that theater really moved me and made me think about my own future with my own kids,\" she said. \"If I had a male [child], I would absolutely want him to see this.\"\n\nAnd like the Alice Paul character in \"Suffs,\" these girls said they see more fight in their futures given recent events like the reversal of Roe v. Wade and persistent problems of gender inequality. The prospect didn't seem to daunt them.\n\n\"It kind of makes me want to fight more,\" said Cora Schmidt, 18, of Moorestown. \"It makes me excited because I love having those conversations and bringing those more difficult topics to people. It's a good way for people to acknowledge there's still struggles for women in this country.\"\n\nLindsey Catlett, 18, of Mount Laurel, seems to view the future as a certain suffragist had.\n\n\"I think there's still more fighting, a lot more work to be done because there's still the gender wage gap and there's still a lot of other issues in the world,\" she said. \"Like they say in the show, it's not going to be done and most people are not going to live long enough to see it. I think that's true.

Wells and Carrie Chapman.\n\nClinton and Taub joined \"Morning Joe\" on Thursday to talk about their experience producing the Tony-nominated musical, \"Suffs,\" and its significance today as women's rights, once again, hang in the balance.\n\n\"In this election year, we need a lot of joy to be honest,\" Clinton said on the show. \"Going to see how the struggle finally ended for women to get the right to vote with the passage of the 19th Amendment is not only a thrilling experience because of the extraordinary work that [Taub] has done in bringing this piece of history to life in such an entertaining way, but it's so relevant today.\"\n\nThe play follows key events in the suffragist movement, beginning in 1913 with the first large-scale political march in Washington, D.C. and culminating with the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920.\n\n\"Suffs\" features an all-female and non-binary cast (Pres. Woodrow Wilson is played by a woman) and behind the scenes, the play is almost entirely led by women. Taub started the project more than a decade ago and is only the second woman to write the book, music, lyrics and star in her own Broadway musical, which is nominated for six Tony awards.\n\n\"I'm so excited to now get to share this story that I -- growing up and going to public school -- never learned about my own history, through a musical and through a cast album, that hopefully we can share with people all over the country to learn about where we came from and learn that women have done hard things in hard times and we can change the world again,\" Taub said.\n\nWhen she learned that Clinton saw the show in New York in 2022, she decided to write a letter to the former Secretary of State, asking her join the show as a producer. Clinton immediately agreed and jumped in, attending the cast's first rehearsal, collaborating with Taub on the production's creative process, and even hosting a DNC fundraiser at the show for President Biden.\n\n\"I was surprised and touched that Shaina had written to me, and then I started to think, storytelling is a big part of politics and it's a big part of what we have to do a better job of in our country,\" Clinton said. \"We have to tell the story of our past, but we also have to tell the story of where we are right now and what we want for the future ... [Taub] has a line which says progress is possible, not guaranteed ... you have to fight for the future now, you can't just hope it's going to turn out well.\"\n\nIndeed, the former Secretary of State wasn't the only icon to recognize the show's singularity in an election year -- Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai also participated as a producer. \"It carries a very strong message to women and girls that the fight may not be over yet,\" Yousafzai told CBS recently.\n\n\"... We all feel a renewed sense of urgency to remind people and especially remind women of our electoral power,\" Taub said. \"When we come together, we can fight for our rights, and it feels more important than ever.\"", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffs_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suffs (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaina_Taub", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shaina Taub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alice Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ida_B._Wells", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ida B.

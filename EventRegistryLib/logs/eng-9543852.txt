Spacey shared a 30-minute biographical video of Kennedy narrated by Woody Harrelson\n\nActor Ruari Cannon, who is featured in the documentary, told The i newspaper that Spacey touched him in a 'highly intimate way' at a press night for an Old Vic theater production in 2013.\n\nSpacey called the allegation 'ridiculous' and denied it happened.\n\nThe actor also insisted he never offered anyone career help in exchange for sex.\n\n'I take full responsibility for my past behavior and my actions,' Spacey told journalist Dan Wootton.

The new documentary, Spacey Unmasked, is set to bring new allegations to light about the House of Cards star.\n\nLast year Spacey was found not guilty by a jury of nine sexual offences alleged by four men between 2001 and 2013 after a trial in London. He also won a US civil lawsuit in October 2022, after being accused of an unwanted sexual advance at a party in 1986.\n\nSpeaking to former GB News presenter Dan Wootton, Spacey shared his thoughts on the new documentary and denied allegations against him.\n\nREAD MORE: 'It was incredible' Welsh actress details working with Kevin Spacey before his recent acquittal\n\nREAD MORE: Actor Kevin Spacey in tears as he's cleared of sexual assault\n\n\"I take full responsibility for my past behaviour and my actions, but I cannot and will not take responsibility or apologise to anyone who's made up stuff about me or exaggerated stories about me,\" Spacey told Wootton, who was fired from GB News last year. He added: \"I've never told someone that if they give me sexual favours, then I will help them out with their career, never.\n\n\"I've clearly hooked up with some men who thought they might get ahead in their careers by having a relationship with me. But there was no conversation with me, it was all part of their plan, a plan that was always destined to fail, because I wasn't in on the deal.\"\n\nDuring the interview, he denied accusations of any illegal behaviour, but did say he had made \"clumsy passes\" at people in the past. \"Were there times when I would flirt with some of the people who were involved in those programmes who were in their 20s? Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"Did I ever hook up with another actor? Yes. Did I make a clumsy pass at someone who wasn't interested as it turned out? Yes. But I was not employing them, I was not their boss, I was often times just swimming in for an hour here or there as a well-known actor to lend support... to answer questions. That may not have been the best decision, and it is not one that I would do today, but it happened. It wasn't illegal, and nor has it ever been alleged to have been illegal.\"\n\nIn 2017 allegations were first made about Spacey and Netflix, the makers of House of Cards, subsequently cut ties with the actor.

Kennedy Jr.'s third party bid for the White House landed an unusual endorsement on Monday: Kevin Spacey.\n\nThe Academy Award-winning actor announced his support on X, formerly Twitter in response to a new video from Kennedy Jr.'s campaign that was narrated by Woody Harrelson, another celebrity supporter.\n\nSpacey described Kennedy Jr. as a \"loyal friend.\"\n\n\"There's a lot I can learn from this man. When the world turned its back on me, Bobby leaned in,\" he wrote. \"He's a formidable fighter for justice and a loyal friend that's not afraid to stand up for what he believes.\"\n\nThe video from Kennedy Jr.'s campaign begins with him reading various words from critics, saying he's \"divorced from reality\" and a conspiracy theorist, printed in the media about his presidential run.\n\nSpacey's endorsement of Kennedy Jr. comes as the actor is facing a new wave of misconduct allegations. Spacey Unmasked, a Channel 4 documentary, is set to air on May 6 and 7 in the U.K., and it will stream on the Max streaming app in the U.S. The documentary contains multiple new accusers with allegations that cover decades.\n\nThe actor denied the allegations of sexual harassment in an interview with UK presenter Dan Wootton. In the lengthy chat, Spacey responded to each allegation as they were described in an email to Channel 4. Spacey claimed the network did not give him adequate time to respond, and he questioned the timing of the documentary's release as it comes after multiple wins in court and the actor starting to appear in movies for the first time in years.\n\nIn 2017, Spacey was accused of sexual misconduct amid a flurry of other allegations against famous famous as part of the #MeToo movement. Among the accusations was actor Anthony Rapp, who accused Spacey of sexual assault when he was a minor. Rapp ultimately lost a sexual battery lawsuit in New York in 2022. Spacey was also found not guilty on multiple sexual assault charges in the U.K. in 2023.\n\nThe allegations of misconduct led to Spacey being booted from Netflix's House of Cards, edited out of Ridley Scott's All the Money in the World, and his Gore Vidal biopic for Netflix was indefinitely shelved. Spacey's career has seen a slight upturn as he's appeared in films again, albeit low budget efforts like 2023's Control and this year's Peter Five Eight. Among his other efforts was a recent sit-down with Tucker Carlson where the actor unofficially reprised his House of Cards character for the bizarre interview.\n\nIn the Wootton interview, Spacey described himself as \"promiscuous\" and said he'd privately apologized for some of his past behavior, but denied allegations of sexual harassment and assault.\n\n\"I take full responsibility for my past behavior and my actions,\" the actor said. \"But I cannot and will not take responsibility or apologize to anyone who's made up stuff about me or exaggerated stories about me,\" he said.\n\nSpacey called it a mistake to come out as homosexual in his response to Rapp's original accusation. The new allegations include men claiming Spacey used his celebrity status and to pressure them, but Spacey denied this and said he's never promised career favors to anyone in exchange for physical favors.\n\n\"I've clearly hooked up with some men, who thought they might get ahead in their careers by having a relationship with me,\" he said. \"But there was no conversation with me, it was all part of their plan, a plan that was always destined to fail, because I wasn't in on the deal.\"", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Spacey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

He claims to have recently finished working on Saving Private Ryan - a heart-rending war epic that begins with a now famously brutal battle scene.\n\nKevin Stacey has repeatedly denied all allegations made against him. Last year, the actor was found not guilty of nine sexual offences against four men in their 20s and 30s, between 2004 and 2013. He sobbed at the dock when the verdict was delivered. Now he's hit out at the fresh claims made by men unrelated to the trial in Channel 4's debut documentary, Spacey Unmasked.\n\nREAD MORE: Denise Welch rips into TV star live on air as they come to blows over Meghan Markle\n\nActor Scott, who only goes by his first name in the film, claims he met Spacey while watching a friend's band play at The Viper Room on West Hollywood's Sunset Strip. He says he was initially 'over the moon' to meet Spacey - an actor then at the very height of his career. Having won an Oscar two years previously for the role of Roger 'Verbal' Kint in The Usual Suspects, Spacey was another two years away from scooping a second Oscar in his feature directorial debut, American Beauty (2000).\n\nScott, who was still working to establish himself at that point, admits on the show: \"For me, he was just on such a pedestal. I'm not going to lie, I was starstruck.\" The pair apparently 'hit it off', and former Marine Scott began opening up to Spacey about his acting dreams.\n\nThe film school graduate claims Spacey was encouraging, allegedly asking for Scott's headshot and resum\u00e9 and even telling him they could potentially work together. 'Amazed' by the attention from such a high-profile star, Scott recalled being on a high as he, Spacey and the rest of the party allegedly left The Viper Room and headed off to a large house in the Hollywood Hills. He claims the 'energy shifted' when Spacey invited him to see the home theatre room.\n\nScott alleged: \"That's when I started to feel the energy shift a little bit. And he was like, 'Can I have a hug?' And I was like, 'huh, okay, guess that's an LA thing'. [...] So I go in to give him a quick bro hug, and he just gets me in this bear grip, and he's kind of rubbing his whiskey face in my neck, kind of grinding into me, like humping me.\"\n\nAfter Scott reminded Spacey that his girlfriend was downstairs, Spacey allegedly appeared nonplussed, telling him that it was all fine, and not to 'freak out'. The incident is said to have left Scott feeling 'shaky', and full of questions and confusion. While 'nursing a hangover', Scott says he received a phone call.\n\nThe actor says he recognised the voice instantly as Spacey, who told him they should get together and sort out his headshots. They then apparently agreed to meet up on a corner close to a cinema where Saving Private Ryan was playing.\n\nScott recalled: \"He said, 'Hey, it's your movie, we should go see it!' I had this intuition that this thing could go sideways in a myriad of ways, but I was also still very much under the impression that I was in control. Kevin grabbed a seat, way up high, very hidden, very private.\n\n\"And we're watching the movie, first 20 minutes of the invasion of Normandy, it's shockingly horrific. There's a guy picking up his arm, and people are on fire, and people are just dying in really the most horrible ways you can die.\n\n\"All of a sudden, I just saw some activity happening next to me and I kind of glance over and Kevin's just pleasuring himself. You know, some of the most horrific war footage ever recreated, and like, there's no way that this is happening. This guy is rubbing one out during the invasion of Normandy?\"\n\nHe continued: \"And finally, he reaches over and grabs my hand, and tries to get me to help out. I was like, 'no'. It was crazy.\"\n\nSpacey, 64, responded to the claims ahead of the show's release. The actor took to X, formerly Twitter, to share a screenshot of an alleged email from a man named 'Scott', who appears to ask Spacey for a role in a film he was working on after the alleged cinema incident.\n\nIn 2022, a New York jury concluded that Spacey was not guilty of molesting actor Anthony Rapp, who had accused the Hollywood star of sexually assaulting him back in the 1980s when he was just 14. A year later, in July 2023, Spacey was acquitted of nine sexual offences against four men at London's Southwark Crown Court.\n\nAddressing members of the press outside the courtroom following the verdict, Spacey said: \"I would like to say that I am enormously grateful to the jury for having taken the time to examine all of the evidence and all of the facts carefully before they reached their decision. I am humbled by the outcome today. I also want to thank the staff inside this courthouse, the security, and all of those who took care of us every single day.\"\n\nThe new documentary Spacey Unmasked features interviews with multiple men, unconnected to the trial, who are now speaking publicly for the first time about their alleged experiences with Spacey. The description reads as follows: \"Spacey Unmasked is a forensic look at a man who was once one of the most admired and respected actors in the world. Featuring never-seen-before interviews and archive, the series examines his life from childhood to early success on Broadway and subsequent meteoric rise to stardom. Kevin Spacey's spectacular fall from grace came amid allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour.\"\n\nThe Mirror has seen the two-part doc, which speaks to actors who met Spacey on set and at parties in both the UK and the US. All ten individuals suggest his behaviour was inappropriate in some way. Responding to Channel 4 on Friday, May 3, Spacey stated that he'd been provided with insufficient time and detail to respond to the testimonies. He said: \"I have consistently denied - and now successfully defended - numerous allegations made both in the US and the UK, both criminal and civil, and each time have been able to source evidence undermining the allegations and have been believed by a jury of my peers.\"\n\nSpacey also spoke out against the documentary on Thursday, May 2, via social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, writing: \"Over the last week, I have repeatedly requested that Channel 4 afford me more than seven days to respond to allegations made against me dating back 48 years and provide me with sufficient details to investigate these matters.\n\n\"Channel 4 has refused on the basis that they feel that asking for a response in seven days to new, anonymized and non-specific allegations is a 'fair opportunity' for me to refute any allegations made against me. I will not sit back and be attacked by a dying network's one-sided 'documentary' about me in their desperate attempt for ratings.\"\n\nHe continued: \"There's a proper channel to handle allegations against me and it's not Channel 4. Each time I have been given the time and a proper forum to defend myself, the allegations have failed under scrutiny and I have been exonerated. Tune in this weekend to see my response on http://X.com/kevinspacey. Channel 4 and [documentary producers] RoastBeefTV may find themselves 'speechless', but I no longer will be.\"\n\nIf you've been the victim of sexual assault, you can access help and resources via Dublin Rape Crisis Centre or calling the national telephone helpline on 1800 77 8888.\n\nSpacey Unmasked airs on Channel 4 at 9pm on May 6 and 7.

Featuring never-seen-before interviews and archive, the series examines his life from childhood to early success on Broadway and subsequent meteoric rise to stardom. Kevin Spacey's spectacular fall from grace came amid allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour.\"\n\nThe Mirror has seen the two-part doc, which speaks to actors who met Spacey on set and at parties in both the UK and the US. All ten individuals suggest his behaviour was inappropriate in some way. Responding to Channel 4 on Friday, May 3, Spacey stated that he'd been provided with insufficient time and detail to respond to the testimonies. He said: \"I have consistently denied - and now successfully defended - numerous allegations made both in the US and the UK, both criminal and civil, and each time have been able to source evidence undermining the allegations and have been believed by a jury of my peers.\"\n\nSpacey also spoke out against the documentary on Thursday, May 2, via social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, writing: \"Over the last week, I have repeatedly requested that Channel 4 afford me more than seven days to respond to allegations made against me dating back 48 years and provide me with sufficient details to investigate these matters.\n\n\"Channel 4 has refused on the basis that they feel that asking for a response in seven days to new, anonymized and non-specific allegations is a 'fair opportunity' for me to refute any allegations made against me. I will not sit back and be attacked by a dying network's one-sided 'documentary' about me in their desperate attempt for ratings.\"\n\nHe continued: \"There's a proper channel to handle allegations against me and it's not Channel 4. Each time I have been given the time and a proper forum to defend myself, the allegations have failed under scrutiny and I have been exonerated. Tune in this weekend to see my response on http://X.com/kevinspacey. Channel 4 and [documentary producers] RoastBeefTV may find themselves 'speechless', but I no longer will be.\"\n\nIf you've been the victim of sexual assault, you can access help and resources via www.rapecrisis.org.uk or calling the national telephone helpline on 0808 802 9999\n\nSpacey Unmasked airs on Channel 4 at 9pm on May 6 and 7.

The court victory was his second since he saw off a $40 million lawsuit in 2022 in New York brought by \"Star Trek: Discovery\" actor Anthony Rapp.\n\nThe documentary \"Spacey Unmasked\" was set to be aired Tuesday and Wednesday and 7 on Channel 4 in Britain and streamed on Max in the U.S.\n\nThe documentary is said to feature testimony from men regarding events between 1976 and 2013, the actor revealed during the interview.\n\n\"I take full responsibility for my past behaviour and my actions, but I cannot and will not take responsibility or apologize to anyone who's made up stuff about me or exaggerated stories about me,\" said Spacey, who won Academy Awards for \"The Usual Suspects\" and \"American Beauty\".\n\n\"I've never told someone that if they give me sexual favors, then I will help them out with their career, never,\" he added.\n\nSpacey, who served as artistic director of the Old Vic Theatre in London from 2004 to 2015, again admitted that he was a \"flirt\" with men in their 20s and that he made \"clumsy\" passes at times.\n\n\"I've clearly hooked up with some men, who thought they might get ahead in their careers by having a relationship with me,\" he said. \"But there was no conversation with me, it was all part of their plan, a plan that was always destined to fail, because I wasn't in on the deal.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Spacey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Wootton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Wootton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_in_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television in the United Kingdom"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Trek: Discovery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Rapp", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Rapp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Channel 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Beauty_(soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Beauty (soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Vic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Old Vic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/9948305f23d2d602b84a81431e61e2af", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543852", "eventUri": "eng-9543852", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

The documentary is airing first in the United Kingdom, which means American audiences will need some tricks to stream the expos\u00e9 for themselves. The good news is, we've rallied up the best options to watch Spacey Unmasked in the US up ahead.\n\nSpacey Unmasked is a two-part documentary produced by British broadcast network Channel 4, focusing on the controversies surrounding former House of Cards actor Kevin Spacey. Specifically speaking, the documentary is billed as a \"forensic look at Kevin Spacey's rise and fall from grace\" following multiple allegations of sexual misconduct and assault against the actor, and the legal battles he's faced since his first accuser stepped forward in 2017.\n\nFilmed in response to these various allegations and Spacey's 2023 legal trial in the UK, the documentary aims to provide a detailed account of the accusations against him -- exploring stories from multiple accusers and tracing the trajectory of his career before and after the allegations emerged. It also examines how the accusations impacted Spacey's reputation, leading to his removal from major projects and the serious shift in his public image.\n\nSpacey Unmasked also covers the outcome of Spacey's trial in London, where he was acquitted of multiple charges in July 2023. The documentary is set to include commentary from individuals connected to the case, along with interviews with \"multiple men unconnected to that case about their experiences with Kevin Spacey, almost all of whom have never spoken before.\" Legal and cultural experts will also provide insight into the broader context of the allegations, in terms of what it all means for the issue of accountability in Hollywood.\n\nWhile Channel 4 struck a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery for streaming rights in the United States, there is still no premiere date set for when it will stream on Max and air on ID's cable channel. Currently, there's only one way for American audiences to watch Spacey Masked in the US -- and we're taking you through the step-by-step process up ahead.\n\nPart one of Spacey Unmasked will air on Channel 4 in the UK on Monday, May 6, 2024, at 9:00 PM local time.

Actor Anthony Rapp was among the first to step forward, accusing Spacey of making a sexual advance toward him in 1986 when Rapp was just 14 years old. As Rapp's story gained attention, several others stepped forward with similar claims against Spacey, alleging inappropriate behavior and sexual misconduct.\n\nIn response to these allegations, Spacey issued an apology to Rapp, though he stated he did not remember the incident. He also came out as gay, a move that was widely criticized for attempting to divert focus from the sexual misconduct accusations. The fallout from these allegations was swift, with significant repercussions for Spacey's career. Netflix removed him from the final season of House of Cards, where he was the lead actor throughout the series, and he was also replaced in the 2017 crime film All the Money in the World, with his scenes being re-shot using another actor.\n\nSpacey faced a series of legal challenges following these allegations. In 2018, he was charged with indecent assault and battery in Massachusetts. He pleaded not guilty, and the case was eventually dropped in 2019 when the accuser declined to testify. Outside of the United States, Spacey also faced multiple charges in the United Kingdom, with alleged incidents dating back to 2004.\n\nThe most significant of these legal proceedings took place in the UK, where Spacey faced multiple charges of sexual offenses. The trial, which took place in London, ended in July 2023 with Spacey being acquitted of all charges. During the trial, he testified in his own defense, and the jury found him not guilty. Despite his acquittal, the allegations have had a lasting impact on Spacey's career and public image. He has not had a leading role in any major film or television project since the allegations came to light.\n\nAhead of the premiere of Spacey Unmasked, the embattled House of Cards actor took to X (formerly Twitter) to slam \"dying network\" Channel 4 for what he described as a \"desperate attempt for ratings.\" Spacey also called out the network for not giving him ample time to respond to the claims made against him in the documentary.\n\n\"Over the last week, I have repeatedly requested that Channel 4 afford me more than 7 days to respond to allegations made against me dating back 48 years and provide me with sufficient details to investigate these matters,\" he wrote on X. \"Channel 4 has refused on the basis that they feel that asking for a response in 7 days to new, anonymized and non-specific allegations is a \"fair opportunity\" for me to refute any allegations made against me.\"\n\nSpacey continued, \"I will not sit back and be attacked by a dying network's one-sided \"documentary\" about me in their desperate attempt for ratings. There's a proper channel to handle allegations against me and it's not Channel 4.\" The actor went on to maintain his innocence against the documentary's claims, noting he has been \"exonerated\" whenever he has \"been given the time and a proper forum to defend myself.\"\n\nThe Academy Award winner followed up on his initial response in an interview with former U.K. broadcaster Dan Wootton. During the interview, which lasted over two hours and streamed on X on May 3, 2024, Spacey said he would not stay silent in the wake of the documentary's claims. \"I can't go through this again, allowing myself to be basically attacked without defending myself as well,\" he shared.\n\nWhile the actor admitted to being \"promiscuous,\" \"flirty,\" and \"definitely persistent,\" in his advances in the past, he denied all legal wrongdoing. \"I take full responsibility for my past behavior and my actions, but I cannot and will not take responsibility or apologize to anyone who's made up stuff about me or exaggerated stories about me,\" Spacey said.", "source": {"uri": "stylecaster.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "StyleCaster"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jenzia_burgos@stylecaster.com", "name": "Jenzia Burgos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExpressVPN", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ExpressVPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Spacey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Channel 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virtual private network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NordVPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NordVPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

He received his first Oscar in 1996 for his astonishing supporting role as whipsmart criminal Verbal in The Usual Suspects, and his second would come four years later, following his evocative portrayal of American Beauty's downtrodden dad Lester Burnham.\n\nHe has a Tony Award and a Golden Globe to his name too, as well as an honorary knighthood and CBE, and has made icons of numerous characters besides, most notably House of Cards' unsrupulous climber Frank Underwood and Se7en's unsettlingly remorseless John Doe.\n\nTwo-part documentary Spacey Unmasked traces his journey from a middle-class New Jersey upbringing to godlike status in Hollywood, and the meteoric fall that would follow.\n\nIn 2017, actor Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of making sexual advances at him when he was just 14 years old. Spacey responded with an apology, but added that he had no memory of the encounter, which he described as \"deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.\" To widespread outrage, he also used his statement to declare: \"I choose now to live as a gay man.\"\n\nWhat followed was a deluge of accusations of inappropriate sexual misconduct, which Spacey Unmasked promises to \"take a forensic look at,\" including the $40 million civil lawsuit that Spacey won in 2022, and his acquittal when facing nine further charges of sexual assault in 2023.\n\nThere are two episodes in total with the second set to air the following night, at 9pm BST on Tuesday, May 7.\n\nBoth episodes will also be available to stream on Channel 4's free on-demand service.\n\nYou can access the on-demand Channel 4 service on desktop and through a number of devices via its app. While watching any live TV in the UK requires a TV licence, you won't need one for watching on catch-up. It's free to sign up to stream Channel 4. All you need is an email address and a UK postcode (e.g. SW1P 2TX).\n\nAway from the UK and want to stream Spacey Unmasked? Use a VPN using the instructions below to access Channel 4 like you would at home.\n\nIf you're a UK citizen on vacation or working overseas, you can still watch Spacey Unmasked just as you would at home.\n\nWhile Channel 4 blocks access from IP addresses outside of the UK, there's a handy piece of software called a VPN, which can change your IP address to make it look like you're accessing streaming services from any country in the world.\n\nFor example, UK citizens currently in the States can subscribe to a VPN, join a UK-based server and tune into all the programmes on Channel 4 from anywhere in the world, just like you would back home.\n\n1. Choose your ideal VPN and install - our go-to recommendation for unblocking is NordVPN, costing from $3.99 a month with its 2-year plan\n\n2. Connect to a server - for Channel 4, for example, you'll want to connect to a server based in the UK\n\n3. Go to the stream you wish to access - for Spacey Unmasked, head to Channel 4\n\nMax has the rights to Spacey Unmasked in the US. but at the time of writing there's no word on when the show will be available to stream.\n\nYou can get a Max subscription with plans starting from $9.99 a month, but to skip commercials and download shows to watch on the go, opt for its pricier $15.99 a month plan. Max has also introduced a more premium tier which throws in 4K streams for $19.99 a month.\n\nRemember, though: if you're a Brit abroad, you can use a VPN to access Channel 4 streams as if you were back home. Full instructions above.\n\nIt's a similiar situation in Canada, where we're still waiting for confirmation on whether or not Spacey Unmasked will air.\n\nIf you're currently visiting Canada from the UK, remember that you can use a VPN to access Channel 4 streams as if you were back home.\n\nSpacey Unmasked is a two-part documentary that airs on consecutive nights following the below schedule:",

The testimonies include incidents that occurred over five decades, including on the set of \"House of Cards,\" Variety reported. Spacey denounced the documentary as a \"desperate attempt for ratings\" and accused Channel 4 of failing to give him a \"fair opportunity\" to defend himself in a post on X last week. In addition to the U.K. court case, Spacey was found not liable for assault and battery in a separate case out of New York in 2022 and in a case against him in Nantucket in 2019. After the initial allegations were made public in 2017 -- when actor Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of making a sexual advance toward him in 1986, when Rapp was 14 years old -- Spacey claimed he couldn't remember the incident and came out for the first time as gay.\n\nKennedy Jr., a lifelong Democrat, switched his party affiliation to independent shortly after announcing his run for president. A former environmental lawyer who leads an anti-vaccine advocacy nonprofit, Kennedy Jr. could sway the results of the election. Former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden are polling within points of each other and some surveys show Kennedy Jr. with support from up to 13% of voters -- though results are often split on whether his candidacy hurts Trump or Biden more. Since he is running as an independent, Kennedy Jr. faces an uphill battle to secure ballot access and has only done so in Michigan, California and Utah so far, according to his campaign.\n\nNew 'Spacey Unmasked' Documentary To Explore Sexual Harassment And Abuse Claims Against Actor Kevin Spacey (Forbes)\n\nRFK Jr. Launches Independent 2024 Run: Here Are All The Conspiracies He Promotes -- From Vaccines To Mass Shootings (Forbes)\n\nRFK Jr. Demands Biden Take 'No Spoiler Pledge' To Drop Out Of Race If Polls Show He Can't Beat Trump (Forbes)", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Spacey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Channel 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Rapp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Rapp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Perhaps that's understandable, given that Spacey Unmasked is a relentless spool of allegations from men saying how Spacey was (among other things) \"the devil\". But whatever the merits of the allegations made, there was nothing desperate about Kira Phillips's two films.\n\nSpacey Unmasked certainly doesn't feel like a sensationalist witch hunt: it is stressed from the outset that in a British court last year Spacey was found not guilty of all charges of sexual assaults against four men between 2001 and 2013. None of the men speaking here were involved in those trials. It also reports a civil trial verdict in America, one that found that Spacey did not sexually abuse Anthony Rapp, then 14, while both were relatively unknown actors in Broadway plays in 1980s.\n\nIn addition, the documentary tries to interweave stories from Spacey's childhood to at least grant some kind of understanding as to why he might have grown up to be brilliant, shape-shifting, magnetic, predatory. (Spacey's father, his estranged brother Randy claims, was a violent abuser; unfortunately Randy, a Rod Stewart impersonator with a Liberace dress sense, does not come across as the most reliable witness.)\n\nSpacey, we know, was offered a right to reply by Channel 4 (though his fulminations on X show he felt he wasn't given enough time). The actor has since had his own say in a long interview with the former GB News presenter Dan Wootton, in which he again denies all of the allegations. On X, he has described Phillips's work as a \"crocumentary\".\n\nReally though, the programme attempts to establish that there was a pattern to Spacey's behaviour throughout his life, one that he has repeatedly denied and has not been proven in court. A large part of Spacey Unmasked is given over to the complainants. If this documentary is indeed one-sided, it falls on their side.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benji_wilson@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Benji Wilson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Spacey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Channel 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Rapp", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Rapp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sensationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GB News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Wootton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Wootton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rod Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberace", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapeshifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shapeshifting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tv/2024/05/03/TELEMMGLPICT000343936611_17147527574680_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf_4Xpit_DMGvdp2n7FDd82k.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543852", "eventUri": "eng-9543852", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Kennedy Jr. has done everything he can do steal the spotlight, holding event after event with celebrity supporters. Now he can add another to the roster: actor Kevin Spacey.\n\nSpacey, who faced more than a dozen accusations of sexual misconduct or assault since the #MeToo movement gripped the culture in 2017, appeared to indicate in a tweet on Monday that Kennedy had been there for him at his lowest. \"There's a lot I can learn from this man,\" Spacey wrote, sharing a 30-minute Kennedy ad that the campaign claims Facebook and Instagram parent Meta is trying to censor. (Meta said that the link to the video was blocked for about a day because it was incorrectly flagged as spam.) \"When the world turned its back on me, Bobby leaned in,\" Spacey told his followers, adding that Kennedy is a \"formidable fighter for justice and a loyal friend that's not afraid to stand up for what he believes.\"\n\nThe allegations against Spacey have recently been examined in a two-part documentary from British broadcaster Channel 4, Spacey Unmasked, which includes interviews with 10 men who accused him of inappropriate behavior or abuse.\n\nSpacey's legal woes arising from the various assault allegations, which he has denied, seem to be behind him at this point. Two U.S. criminal cases didn't go forward (in one case because the accuser died); he was acquitted in a U.K. trial last year; and he successfully defended against a lawsuit brought by actor Anthony Rapp, who claims that Spacey made a sexual advance on him in 1986, when he was 14 years old and Spacey was 26. Spacey also paid $1 million to settle arbitration on his alleged sexual harassment of crew members during the production of Netflix series House of Cards -- a payout greatly reduced from an initial $31 million judgment.\n\nYet his reentry into public life has been bumpy, perhaps in part because, while a pariah of the entertainment industry, Spacey shared creepy (if not downright threatening) Christmas greeting videos in which he addressed viewers as his House of Cards character, the Machiavellian politician Frank Underwood. More recently, he has taken roles in little-noticed indie films and received a standing ovation for his performance of a Shakespeare scene at a \"cancel culture\" event held by the University of Oxford.\n\nKennedy, whom Spacey called a \"loyal friend,\" did not appear to immediately tout or even acknowledge the warm words from the tarnished actor. It's also not clear how he \"leaned in\" as Spacey's reputation cratered in 2017.\n\nHowever, the anti-vax candidate is hardly a stranger to controversy. Married to Curb Your Enthusiasm actress Cheryl Hines, he has put Hollywood figures front and center during his run -- Woody Harrelson narrates the ad that Spacey shared, for example. These two elements of the campaign have seen Kennedy align himself with any number of \"canceled\" celebrities who relate to his rhetoric about censorship and free speech (or at least appreciate his offer of an open forum).\n\nThese include Russell Brand, a comic-turned-conspiracy-theorist who has been accused of rape, sexual assault, and abuse by multiple women and has interviewed Kennedy. Brand will appear as a special guest of the candidate at a \"Night of Country & Comedy\" fundraiser in Nashville on May 15. Motivational speaker and life coach Tony Robbins, whom Kennedy approached at least twice when considering his pick for vice president, has been accused of sexual harassment and assaults dating back to the 1980s. Comedian Bobby Lee, known for repeatedly telling a story about having sex with a \"scared\" young Tijuana prostitute as she cried (he later claimed it was a fabrication) has taken the stage at Kennedy events and given him a platform on his podcast TigerBelly. Eight women have accused actor Jeremy Piven, another Kennedy fundraiser performer, of sexual assault and misconduct.\n\nOf course, not all of Kennedy's well-known backers have such scandals to their credit -- some are apparently just unpleasant. Former Saturday Night Live cast member and Kennedy supporter Rob Schneider was reportedly pulled offstage during a comedy set at a Republican networking event late last year when attendees were offended by his vulgar material. Schneider denied that his routine had been cut short, but in any case, the Kennedy camp kept him on the bill for a fundraiser scheduled soon after unflattering descriptions of the show emerged. That event must have gone somewhat better, because Schneider is among the comedians listed for the upcoming Nashville party with Russell Brand.\n\nWill Spacey eventually join this tour group of the usual suspects, perhaps to offer politically charged recitations of Shakespeare or riff with the crowd as Frank Underwood? Don't be surprised if it happens. Kennedy is drawing on star power wherever he can find it -- and Spacey seems keen to regain an audience under any conditions.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "miles_klee@rollingstone.com", "name": "Miles Klee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Spacey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

You just go like that, what's the point?\"\n\n\"There was a naivety there, of feeling like you were on a mission to become the best actor in the world.\n\n\"But as soon as you get made to feel that small, you're almost muted, you know, your voice gets smaller.\n\n\"From that point on I don't see my career as anything else other than just sort of darting around the edges of quite substantial addiction issues and relationship issues.\"\n\nMr Cannon continued working as an actor for several years but is now an executive coach.\n\nHe lives in Bishopbriggs with his partner and four-year-old daughter.\n\nIn a statement broadcast by C4, Mr Spacey added: \"I have consistently denied and now successfully defended numerous allegations made in both the US and the UK, both criminal and civil, and each time have been able to source evidence undermining the allegations and been believed by a jury of my peers.\"\n\nThe Old Vic Theatre has been contacted for comment.\n\nThe second part and final of Spacey Exposed airs at 9pm tomorrow on C4.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Spacey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannon (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Bird_of_Youth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweet Bird of Youth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Vic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Old Vic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artistic director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Channel 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/MixCollage-06-May-2024-09-15-PM-3250.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543852", "eventUri": "eng-9543852", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Up to that point, he was one of the most respected talents in Hollywood, that rare character actor who had become a superstar without dumbing down his work or pandering to the industry's crassest tendencies.\n\nThere is a reminder of his searing qualities as an actor at the start of the horribly gripping first episode of Spacey Unmasked, as we see his House of Cards alter-ego, Frank Underwood, matter-of-factly snap the neck of an injured dog. \"I have no patience for useless things,\" says Underwood, eyes blanker than a shark's closing in on the kill. The scene established Underwood as one of the great villains of the streaming era. Spacey Unmasked asserts that, behind the scenes, the actor had his own demons.\n\nLast year, after a criminal trial in London, Spacey was found not guilty of nine sexual offences said to have occurred between 2001 and 2013. He also succeeded in a 2022 civil lawsuit in the United States following accusations of an unwanted sexual advance at a party in 1986. In the eyes of the law, he is an innocent man.\n\nBut Channel 4 has now interviewed 10 men not involved in the 2023 criminal trial. Their allegations against Spacey are serious. One House of Cards actor referred to as Daniel - none of the interviewees are identified by their full names, despite appearing on camera - says the actor made inappropriate physical contact moments after they filmed a scene together on the show. \"He had these dead eyes looking at me,\" Daniel recalls. \"I felt I was staring into this soulless monster.\"\n\nSome of the men gravitated toward Spacey because they believed he could help them break into Hollywood. One of the more unsettling aspects of the documentary is the portrait it paints of fame and its distorting power. Another man, Jesse, claims to have briefly had oral sex with Spacey even though he was straight - because he felt it was something he had to do to advance in Hollywood. He claims to have later realised that Spacey saw him not as a potential creative collaborator but as a plaything. His \"reward\" for giving the actor what he wanted was the opportunity to spend time in his company and listen to his jokes, he said. \"He never asked me about the script; there was no quid pro quo,\" says Jesse. \"He was never offering me anything. I was in the graces of your company. And that's your gift.\"\n\nThere is even more disturbing testimony from a former marine and aspiring actor named Scott. He says he accompanied Spacey to a screening of Saving Private Ryan. He recalls turning to Spacey during the gory opening battle sequence to see the actor engaged in a lewd act. \"Some of the most horrific war footage ever created,\" he recalls of his reaction. \"There is no way this is happening.\" He breaks down and walks off-camera. \"Your first reaction is not violence,\" he says. \"You feel you've done something wrong. You've brought it on to yourself. You feel shame.\"\n\nSpacey Unmasked, directed by Katherine Haywood, jumps back and forth across the timelines. There are interviews with men who knew Spacey early in his life before The Usual Suspects turned him into a megastar and the \"Mayor of Hollywood\" - including an actor on the independent theatre scene in New York, and a fellow amateur theatre devotee in New Jersey who claimed Spacey made unwanted advances against him in a car.\n\nThere is also an interview with Spacey's older brother, Randy Fowler (Spacey is the actor's middle name), who recollects how their father, Thomas, would beat him while leaving the younger Kevin unharmed. Their upbringing was highly dysfunctional, says Randy. He described how their father was \"full of so much hatred\". He was also a fascist. \"[He] said the Holocaust never happened. Used to have these Nazi meetings at the house. A big Nazi flag on the wall. My father had a riding crop. He used to beat the s*** out of me.\"\n\nWhile part one follows Spacey through his early success and the Oscar-winning triumph of The Usual Suspects and American Beauty, part two, airing Tuesday, 7 May, will take up the tale after he moves to London to become artistic director of the Old Vic theatre in 2004, where he is feted by the entertainment establishment and by royalty (receiving an honorary OBE in 2015).\n\nThe documentary's executive producer Dorothy Byrne has said she hopes it will prompt a \"#MeToo moment for men\".

He has a right to reiterate that fact. Public opinion, however, has long since turned against an actor who was one of the most acclaimed in the world when he won Oscars for The Usual Suspects and American Beauty, but who has been an industry pariah since Netflix fired him from House of Cards in 2017. This new two-part documentary details further allegations of inappropriate behaviour.\n\nSpacey Unmasked is more, though, than a blizzard of marks on one side of an is-he-isn't-he ledger. Viewers who are minded to believe what is alleged in these interviews are given a picture not just of whether an A-list actor came to abuse his position, but how.\n\nThe programme collates allegations made by 10 men, most in the US, some who worked with Spacey when he was the director of the Old Vic theatre in London. With the exceptions of one who was at high school with Spacey, and another who says he encountered him in 1981 long before he was famous, the men all level more or less the same accusation: an influential man made unwanted advances to them and, at the time, they didn't feel able to complain. Only one has come forward publicly before.\n\nWe are shown a familiar picture of Hollywood and the arts/entertainment industry - as they were before the #MeToo movement, in any case - as a place where stars are corrupted by being handed too much power. When a whole multimillion-dollar project hinges on the ability of one performer to draw an audience, it will be a brave junior colleague who accuses them of bad workplace behaviour. But when those giving testimony are men, the problem underlying #MeToo revelations - old-fashioned, rotten misogyny - is absent.\n\nInstead, the secondary problem here is the lingering stigma of being gay. In the second half of the 1990s, Spacey reached the very top of the acting profession and wasn't known for romantic lead roles that would require him to portray heterosexual men, yet still he felt unable to come out. He only did so in 2017 when the first allegation was made against him, in a move that was widely criticised by LGBTQ+ commentators who felt he was using his announcement to deflect criticism. Before then, anyone accusing Spacey of groping them would also have been outing him as gay.\n\nOne interviewee here claims to have witnessed Spacey viciously mocking two gay men in a bar. Another says that when he rejected the actor's advances, what really riled Spacey was the implication that he was homosexual. The impression given is of a man who has spent his life raging with shame at what he is, with this anger manifesting as abuse. This narrative, and the fact that Spacey made his name playing scheming, self-hating villains, is turned into dark tragedy by the appearance of the actor's brother, Randy, repeating his contention that their late father was a neo-Nazi who beat and oppressed his sons and who repeatedly raped Randy.\n\nThat the accusers are all male means Spacey Unmasked adds something valuable to the wider discussion about sexual misconduct. Get over it, women are often told: what harm does it really do if your boss slyly leans his body against you or puts his hand on your thigh when no one can see? Spacey has never been accused of anything as serious as the allegations made against Harvey Weinstein or Bill Cosby, or of what his brother says their father did. But here we see stereotypically strong men - a boxer, an ex-Marine - vocalising how a single negative experience still deeply affects them psychologically, years later. Anyone tempted to dismiss the incidents described as minor - man up mate, no harm done, why didn't you just say no? - cannot describe the person talking as weak, because there is then a second, third and fourth man with the same emotional response. (Spacey has hit back at the programme, criticising the lack of detail in the allegations that were put to him and the time he was given to respond. He has also described some of his interactions with other men as \"clumsy\" but maintains that his conduct \"wasn't illegal, and nor has it ever been alleged to have been illegal\".)\n\nSpacey Unmasked's alleged victims are all men, but not all the interviewees, tellingly, are male. Two women who worked on House of Cards recall seeing what a California judge later agreed was inappropriate behaviour amounting to workplace harassment: the bitter experience gained over years of daring to exist as female suggests they could tell from across the room when a conversation had the wrong vibe, or when a hand was resting on the wrong part of someone else's body. Anyone watching Spacey Unmasked will gain some of that wisdom.\n\n* Spacey Unmasked is on Channel 4 now and will air on Max in the US at a later date", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeToo_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MeToo movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Cards (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A-list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(common_law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil law (common law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Vic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Old Vic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Spacey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heterosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social stigma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Weinstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Channel 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cosby", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Cosby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/41bc3ee00bc8c038837cf5b0bd290586", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543852", "eventUri": "eng-9543852", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 452726801, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 20, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 20}}}

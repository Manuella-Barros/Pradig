Obviously, that's important, but it's also about the friends you meet, the stories that are told, and the laughs you share.\n\nI travelled to Notre Dame on Friday with fellow supporters from Chelsea Chicago. We were co-hosting the supporters' events in South Bend across the weekend with our friends from Circle City Chelsea, the Official Supporters Club for Indianapolis.\n\nSupporters across the U.S were in attendance; be that from Milwaukee Blues, Iowa Blues, O.C. Blues, Beltway Blues or further afield. We held a trivia contest and congratulations to Phil Watson from Iowa Blues, who won himself a signed shirt from our 2021 Champions League win.\n\nIt was an early start on Saturday with hundreds of supporters packed into Brothers Bar for the legend's event with Carlo Cudicini. Carlo was, as usual, an absolute gentleman and shared stories for supporters young and old amid a sea of blue flags and scarves.\n\nA special thanks to the club for partnering with us again this summer - and also to Brothers for giving us everything we could have wished for from a Chelsea venue.\n\nSupporters walked en masse to the stadium. The streets were filled with blue, the sun was shining and there were smiles on everyone's faces.\n\nThese are the moments that aren't always seen but shape your match-day experience. Not everything happens inside the stadium.\n\nOf course, the game didn't quite go as we all hoped. But bad days can happen and the opportunity to watch Chelsea live is never taken for granted. It's why supporters remained happy in the stands. It's not all about the result.\n\nAfter the game, a lot of us headed back to Brothers. It was a real chance to meet up with old friends from across the country, those who you will have met at Chelsea matches before but maybe not seen for a couple of years.\n\nAnd you meet new supporters too, those who have maybe attended a Chelsea game for the first time. It's a great time and helps you enjoy the day no matter what has happened on the pitch.\n\nYou never know when Chelsea will be back in a city near you. That's why, if you have the chance, make sure to get a ticket to one or more of the remaining tour matches. It's a great experience...even if the 90 minutes doesn't go as hoped!\n\nChelsea vs Real Madrid - Tuesday 6 August at Bank of America Stadium, Charlotte, North Carolina - click for tickets or buy Club Chelsea hospitality packages", "source": {"uri": "chelseafc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chelsea Football Club"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Notre Dame Fighting Irish football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Cudicini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Cudicini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Bend,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Bend, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Bend, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "http://res.cloudinary.com/chelsea-production/image/upload/c_fit,h_630,w_1200/v1/editorial/news/2024/07/29/Brian_Wolff_USA_Tour_1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777851", "eventUri": "eng-9777851", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 2474, "textEnd": 2482}], "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Following a dramatic 4-1 defeat to Celtic in their last preseason game, Chelsea are still looking for their first victory under new manager Enzo Maresca. Here is our Chelsea predicted lineup for their third pre-season game of their USA tour.\n\nMaresca made a few notable changes from his first match, against Celtic. Namely, 23-year-old Wesley Fofana earned a start at right centre-half while Ukranian winger Mykhailo Mudryk started at left-wing. Fofana's comeback to starting fitness was encouraging after missing the entirety of Mauricio Pochettino's tenure from an ACL tear, but his unassured performance at the back, left many fans unimpressed. Likewise, Mudryk's inability to significantly influence the attack was underwhelming.\n\nRobert Sanchez started in goal and had a volatile 90 minutes. Despite the 4-1 scoreline, Sanchez made many key saves to prevent further calamity. However, he also gave the ball away frequently in possession which is a fatal flaw in Maresca's system.\n\nRead More: Five Most Promising Performances As Chelsea Draw With Wrexham\n\nClub captain Reece James once again led the team from right-back while Benoit Badiashile and Levi Colwill kept their spots along the backline. Badiashile in particular had an afternoon to forget after gifting Celtic their third goal of the game from a sloppy giveaway.\n\nA midfield three of Romeo Lavia, Christopher Nkunku, and Carney Chukwuemeka maintained their spots in the starting lineup alongside Marc Guiu and Noni Madueke. Nkunku scored for a second consecutive game while Guiu continued to show promise as one of Chelsea's best-performing players this pre-season.\n\nAfter months of ascending anticipation for this new-look Chelsea squad, the Blues are currently on a pre-season tour to forget. They opened their account with an underwhelming 2-2 draw to Wrexham before being dominated by Celtic in a brutal 4-1 defeat.\n\nRead More: Four Areas That Must Improve After Chelsea's 4-1 Defeat To Celtic\n\nMaresca's tactics haven't been convincing either. His extremely high backline proved to be far too vulnerable against Celtic after conceding numerous quality chances, and the team's lack of stability during transition is a cause for concern.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that this is only preseason. The squad still has to return to full fitness and many players are coming back from long-term injuries. Considering Maresca's position as a new manager, it will also take a considerable amount of time for the players to learn his new tactics and apply them on the pitch. As a result, fans should expect a volatile showing in preseason fixtures.\n\nChelsea's injured contingent is gradually decreasing throughout the preseason tour. In his press conference for the upcoming match, Maresca revealed that Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall will feature after coming back from injury. Nicolas Jackson is also set to return from an ankle injury for the match against Real Madrid on August 6.\n\nRead More: Three Premier League Clubs Make Contact For Chelsea Player\n\nAxel Disasi is still rehabilitating from a hernia surgery similar to the one that Enzo Fernandez underwent at the end of Pochettino's campaign.

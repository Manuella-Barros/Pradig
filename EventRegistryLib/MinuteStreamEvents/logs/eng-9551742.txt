Per the news site, the ring, which is valued at an eye-watering $40,000, is set in yellow gold and studded with roughly 400 diamonds, rubies, and sapphires for a dramatic effect.\n\n\"Honored to have made Tom Brady's last two championship rings. One with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and now again at his roast,\" the Los Angeles-based jeweler wrote in a post shared to his Instagram page. \"Might not be a Super Bowl ring, but we'll take it.\"\n\nAt the top and bottom are the words \"Brady G.R.O.A.T.\" and in the middle is a gold football followed by sparkly fire flames. One side of the ring's band is inscribed with his last name, his jersey number, and the acronym \"LFG.\" The other side has \"2024\" written at the top with the silhouette of a goat underneath it.\n\nThe Roast of Tom Brady, which was live-streamed from the Kia Forum in Inglewood, Calif., drew 2 million viewers when it aired over the weekend. Among the comedians tapped to take shots at the legendary QB were \"roast master general\" Jeff Ross, Nikki Glaser, Tony Hinchcliffe, Sam Jay, Andrew Schulz, Bert Kreischer, and Tom Segura. Brady's former teammates Julian Edelman, Rob Gronkowski, Drew Bledsoe, and Randy Moss also took the stage along with his ex-coach Bill Belichick, and Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Overall, it was the sixth most-watched program to crack the platform's weekly top 10.", "source": {"uri": "robbreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Robb Report"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Anything that benefits from shorter cooking (like leafy greens), or that could be added to a salad without being cooked (think peas, tomatoes, zucchini and the like) will happily simmer away until just softened and then be good as gold. But other veg, such as root veg (other than spuds!), pumpkin, and even capsicum, benefit from having their flavour intensified first with a good roasting until softened. There\u2019s no need to peel these veg before roasting because you can always scoop the flesh off the skins or blitz the skins in, too, if you don\u2019t mind a slightly darker colour.", "summary": "Tick off these simple but important elements, and reap the rewards later with warming bowls full of soul.", "url": "https://www.theage.com.au/goodfood/tips-and-advice/six-steps-that-take-a-soup-from-good-to-great-and-why-you-should-follow-the-omfg-rule-20240604-p5jj4f.html", "image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1819%2C$multiply_0.7025%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_167/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/b155a0955e9631cac3787ccecf424bd2c94d50bd", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:08:50", "author": "Alice Zaslavsky", "authors": ["Alice Zaslavsky"], "language": "en", "source_country": "au", "sentiment": 0.601}

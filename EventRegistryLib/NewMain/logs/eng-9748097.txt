He will also drop explosive claims that his ailing father's will was unlawfully changed by his mother and siblings when he was no longer compos mentis.\n\nAlberto had argued that Joseph's last testament was purposely altered to reduce his equal share in the family fortune after he left the Safra group to set up a competing venture, which lawyers for his mother and siblings called \"an act of disloyalty and ingratitude\". The allegations of unlawful tampering were strenuously denied by Alberto's family.\n\nThe settlement ends a prolonged, multi-jurisdictional legal fight that has been waged in offices and courtrooms from the US to Switzerland via S\u00e3o Paulo and London. The battle shone a rare spotlight on a private banking brand famed for its discretion in serving the world's wealthiest individuals.\n\nRepresentatives for Alberto and the rest of the family declined to provide more details, including whether there had been a financial settlement.\n\n\"We are pleased to put this matter behind us and reaffirm our family bonds,\" Joseph's widow Vicky Safra and her children said in a statement. \"The resolution we have reached will allow us to pursue our respective business interests in ways that help ensure that the success of every member of our family is a reason for shared satisfaction.\"\n\nAlberto Safra said: \"I am happy to put that matter behind [me]. After clarifications, I understood that there were no wrongdoings, and that Mr Safra's estate was properly disposed in accordance to his wishes.\"\n\nThe statement added that Alberto will pursue his business interests through ASA, the fund management company he founded that had prompted the falling-out with the rest of his family.\n\nJoseph, who died at the age of 82 in December 2020, had a reputation as a patron of the arts and philanthropist who donated to hospitals, schools and the Jewish communities in Brazil and elsewhere to which he belonged. He shunned publicity and rarely gave interviews.\n\nHe was the most powerful figure in a banking dynasty whose origins date back 180 years to the financing of trade caravans in Ottoman times. The Safras subsequently established themselves as trusted guardians of the wealth of Beirut's Sephardic Jewish residents.\n\nA branch of the dynasty moved in the 1950s from Lebanon to S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil's financial capital, where they laid the foundations for what became Banco Safra, now one of the country's largest private sector lenders.\n\nThe other main financial enterprises under the family's control are Basel-based J Safra Sarasin, formed by the $1.12bn acquisition of a Swiss institution in 2011, and the Safra National Bank of New York, located on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue.\n\nThe wider J Safra Group conglomerate also owns high-profile real estate such as the \"Gherkin\" office tower in London, as well as a 50 per cent interest in the banana grower Chiquita.", "source": {"uri":

Safra Group, redirecting his energy to ASA Investments, a venture of his own making.\n\nThis resolution avoids further legal entanglements, withdrawing all ongoing lawsuits and arbitration worldwide.\n\nPreviously, Alberto had challenged his share's dilution in the Safra National Bank of New York (SNBY), escalating the family drama to international courts.\n\nThe Safra patriarch, Jos\u00e9, who died in late 2020, left a legacy valued at around $23 billion. The internal strife began long before Jos\u00e9's passing.\n\nWhen Jos\u00e9 retired from active management, disagreements over the bank's direction surfaced between Alberto and his brother David.\n\nThis friction led Alberto to shift from managing Safra Bank to focus on his own investment firm, while keeping business ties with his family.\n\nThe settlement's specifics remain under wraps, enhancing the intrigue around the agreement terms.\n\nThe family's statement expressed Alberto's relief at resolving the dispute, acknowledging no found irregularities in the inheritance process.\n\nA joint statement from his mother Vicky and brothers highlighted a newfound unity, aiming to bolster familial and business success collectively.\n\nThis closure ends a high-profile family feud and stabilizes a key sector of global banking impacted by the Safra family.\n\nThe saga highlights the intricate dynamics and succession challenges within family-run conglomerates.\n\nIt also sheds light on the consequences of such disputes for international finance and family relationships.", "source": {"uri": "riotimesonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Rio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "iolanda_fonseca@riotimesonline.com", "name": "Iolanda Fonseca", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safra,_Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Safra, Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Safra, Lebanon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safra_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safra family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safra_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safra Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Safra", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Safra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inheritance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arbitration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safra_National_Bank_of_New_York", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safra National Bank of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large_Families", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large Families", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Reunions", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Reunions", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Publications", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.riotimesonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Alberto-Joseph-Safra.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748097", "eventUri": "eng-9748097", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-07-", "textStart": 3, "textEnd": 10}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

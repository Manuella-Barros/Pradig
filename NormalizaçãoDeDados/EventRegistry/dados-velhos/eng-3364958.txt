Brown said after he told the \"Work\" singer that he slept with another woman early in their relationship, things took a turn for the worse.\n\n\"After that, my trust was lost with her.

Brown gives his side in the documentary, explaining that the woman he slept with early in their relationship approached the couple at the event -- which was very upsetting for Rihanna. Later in the night, Brown said he told Rihanna to look at his phone to deny that he had a relationship with the woman in question and the singer actually happened to see a message from her.\n\n\"She starts going off, she throws the phone,\" he said. \"I hate you.' Starts hitting me. We're in a little Lamborghini. She's fighting me. I'm like, 'Look, I'm telling you the truth, I swear'...

This had broken the hearts of millions of fans around the world who adored the relationship between the young musicians.\n\nIn a new documentary titled Chris Brown: Welcome To My Life, the 28 year old has revealed that he would always love Rihanna, but can't move past the fact that he assaulted her. When talking about the night of the assault, he said it had started after he admitted to Rihanna he had sex with a particular lady before he started dating her. This had indeed hurt Riri's feelings and she found it hard trusting him.\n\nAs he still battled to gain her trust, they both attended a pre-Grammy party which the woman also attended without his knowledge. Already pissed by her boyfriend's previous admission, Rihanna burst into tears at the party and while Chris managed to calm her down but things got worse on their way home.\n\nWhile trying to win back her trust, Chris handed over his mobile phone to try and prove he had no idea the woman would be there, but Rihanna found a text that he hadn't read from the female, which said she would indeed be at the event.\n\nHe said: \"She starts going off, she throws the phone, \"I hate you!\", whatever, whatever, she starts hitting me, we're in a little Lamborghini, you know she's fighting me.\n\n\"Like I remember she tried to kick me, just like her beating s**t, but then I really hit her.\n\n\"With a closed fist, like I punched her, and it busted her lip, and when I saw it I was in shock, I was \"f***, why did I hit her like that?\n\n\"So from there she's...spitting blood in my face, it raised me even more. It's a real fight in the car, and we driving in the street.\n\n\"I'm like \"yo, we tripping, what the f***, what are we doing?\" She tried to grab for my phone, and I'm not giving her my phone, to throw it out the window.\"\n\nChris continued: \"I'm just trying to resolve the situation, I'm not trying to fight any further, like I love her, I don't want to hurt my girlfriend.\n\nEven when he tried to prove his innocence regarding the woman at the party, Rihanna didn't believe him.\n\n\"She takes the keys out of the car and fakes it like she throws them out of the window. I get out the car and I'm looking for the keys and somebody yelled and she yells out her door, 'Help, he's trying to kill me.'\"\n\nChris took his bags from the car and told the singer to drive home, adding: \"By this time her lip was busted she had a knock because I'd pushed her head up against the window.\n\nHe also revealed their relationship had become violent before that night after he first told Rihanna about the other woman, saying: \"She hated me, after that, I tried everything.\n\n\"She didn't care, she just didn't trust me after that.

While Brown has shied away from speaking extensively about it over the years, he has opened up about the events of the night and his former relationship with the songstress in the new documentary Chris Brown: Welcome to My Life.\n\nRevealing that he met Rihanna at a 2004 show in New York City when he was 15 and she was 16, Brown says they quickly fell in love. However, he claims that things changed after he admitted to her that early on in their relationship he had lied about having previously slept with a woman who had worked for him.\n\n\"My trust totally was lost with her. She hated me after that. I tried everything, she didn't care. She just didn't trust me after that. From there, it just went downhill because there would be fights, verbal fights, physical fights as well,\" he says.\n\n\"Mutual sides,\" he adds. As he recounts, \"We would fight each other. She would hit me, I would hit her and it never was OK.\"\n\nVIDEO: Chris Brown Details The Night He Was Arrested For Physically Assaulting Then-Girlfriend Rihanna\n\n\"There was always a point where we'd talk about it like, 'What the f -- are we doing?\" he tells the camera. \"Like, 'I don't like you slapping me.' If I go on stage I got a scratch on my face and I gotta explain it like, 'Oh, no I fell.' If you got a scar or a bruise you gotta put makeup on. I'm not ever trying to put my hands on any female.\"\n\n\"I felt like a f -- ing monster,\" he continues. Those fights went to another level the night they attended Clive Davis's pre-Grammy party in February 2009. Brown says their argument kicked off when the woman he previously had sexual relations with came up to them at the event. He told Rihanna he didn't know the woman would be there.\n\n\"The ceremony's about to start, she's just crying,\" Brown recalls. \"She got over it. She started drinking a little bit, we both was drinking a little bit. We were both drinking a little bit, laughing, joking. And then we left.\"\n\nBut their fight struck back up again when Rihanna discovered a text message from the woman on Brown's phone, leading her to believe that he lied and knew the other woman would be at the event. \"I didn't see it ... but it said I'll see you at the Clive party,\" Brown states. \"[Rihanna] starts going off, she throws the phone. I hate you. Starts hitting me ... She hits me a couple of more times and it doesn't go from translation to 'let's sit down, I'm telling you the truth.' It goes to, 'Now, I'm going to be mean, be evil.'\"\n\n\"I remember she tried to kick me, but then I really hit her, with a closed fist, I punched her. I busted her lip,\" he recounts. \"When I saw it, I was in shock. I was like, 'F -- , why the hell did I hit her?'\"\n\n\"From there she just spit in my face,\" Brown continues. \"Spit blood in my face and it enraged me even more.\"\n\nBrown says he then pulled the car over and Rihanna took the keys and pretended to throw them out of the window. \"I get out of the car and I'm looking for the keys and somebody yelled and she yells out her door, 'Help, he's trying to kill me.'\"\n\nRELATED: Rihanna Is Now Selling a Collection of Socks Featuring Her Most Iconic Looks\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Chris Brown Commented on Rihanna's Stunning Instagram Pic -- and the Internet Isn't Too Happy\n\nWhat goes through his mind when he thinks about that time and the photo of her bloodied and bruised face? \"I look back at that picture and I'm like that's not me, bro, that's not me. I hate it to this day. That's going to haunt me forever.\"\n\nIn an interview with Diane Sawyer for 20/20 in November 2009, Rihanna herself reflected on the evening. \"There's nothing you can do or say to make somebody do that to you,\" she said. \"That's on them. I just knew he had a problem. He had a temper. He needed to get some help. And he did.\"\n\nShe went on to describe emotional scars that remain after the physical recovery: \"The thing men don't realize when they hit a woman, it's the face, the broken arm, the black eye, it's going to heal. That's not the problem. It's the scar inside.\"\n\nShe continued: \"You flashback. You remember it all the time. It comes back to you, whether you like it or not.

Now, Chris Brown is finally telling his side of the story in a new documentary, Chris Brown: Welcome to My Life, and the singer isn't holding back on the details. On Aug. 14, 2017, a clip of Brown was posted to a fan's Facebook page. In it, Brown discusses his teenage love affair with Rihanna and their serious relationship issues. He also admits that he cheated on Rihanna, which led to the downfall of their once loving relationship. The details about Chris Brown and Rihanna's abusive relationship are intense, to say the least. Elite Daily reached out to Rihanna's team for comment on Brown's documentary clip, but did not hear back in time of publication.\n\nWhile talking about the cheating incident, he explained,\n\nMy trust totally was lost with her, she hated me after that. I tried everything, she didn't care. She just didn't trust me after that. From there, it just went downhill because there were too many verbal fights, physical fights as well. Mutual sides.

Now Chris is speaking out about what happened on the night that he assaulted Rihanna. E! Online shared what Chris had to say now that he is sharing his side of the story. Chris Brown has a new documentary coming out called Chris Brown: Welcome to My Life and he will be revealing a lot in it. It's been eight years since the big fight between Chris and Rihanna and it sounds like he is finally ready to speak out.\n\nIn a never-before-seen clip from the show, Chris is now sharing that the issues with Rihanna started because he admitted to her about having a sexual relationship with someone he used to work with in the past. Chris hasn't shared who this girl was, but she caused all kinds of issues in their relationship. He revealed that after that Rihanna never trusted him. This obviously caused big problems in the relationship. Chris went on to share more details.\n\n\"I still love Rihanna, but I'm just going to be honest -- we would fight each other, she would hit me, I would hit her, but it never was OK. It was always a point to where we talk about it like, 'What the f**k are we doing?'\"\n\nSo what happened when Chris Brown assaulted Rihanna back in 2009? This girl that he used to have a sexual relationship with was at the same party they were at and came up to him to say hello, but Rihanna wasn't happy at all about that happening. He saw her bawling, and then they got into a big fight about the situation on the way home. Chris is admitting how things got violent and isn't holding back. He revealed details of the fight.\n\n\"I remember she tried to kick me, just like her beating s**t, but then I really hit her. With a closed fist, like I punched her and it busted her lip. And when I saw it I was in shock, I was like, f**k why did I hit her like that?\n\n\"From there she's spitting blood in my face, it raised me even more. It's a real fight in the car and we were driving in the street...She tried to grab for my phone, and I'm not giving her my phone, to throw it out the window.\"\n\nChris now says that he \"felt like a f**king monster\" after this happened. Chris Brown is revealing things about what happened that have not been talked about it until now. Chris and Rihanna did try to date again briefly a few years later, but it didn't last.\n\nChris and Rihanna were together in 2009 when this assault happened. This private fight got very public and pictures were even revealed. Back in 2012, Rihanna spoke out about the incident and said that she has been able to forgive Chris. After that, they were together again for a little while, but of course, it didn't last.\n\nAre you shocked to hear how much Chris Brown is revealing now?

We would fight each other. She would hit me. I would hit her, but it never was okay.\"\n\nAt one point in their relationship, while he was pondering marriage, Brown says that he admitted to lying about one of his exes, a woman who worked for him in the past. He says that Rihanna lost trust in him after that, but their relationship continued.\n\nOn the night he was arrested, Brown says that Rihanna was triggered by the ex, who arrived at Clive Davis' pre-Grammy party after she was told to keep her distance. Brown told Rihanna that he didn't know she would be there, but on their way home, the pop superstar found a text from the same ex in Brown's phone, letting him know she would be attending.\n\nDuring this argument, Brown says that Rihanna hit him and kicked him before he struck her with a closed fist. \"I punched her and it busted her lip,\" he says. \"When I saw it, I was in shock, like, 'Fuck. Why the hell did I hit her?' From there, she spits in my face, spits blood in my face, and it enraged me even more so it's a real-on fight in the car.\"\n\nBrown continues to break down the details of their fight, saying that she grabbed his testicles before he bit her arm. All of this, he says, happened while he was driving a Lamborghini through Hollywood. After he pulled over in the Hancock Park neighborhood, Rihanna pretended to throw his car keys out of the vehicle. \"Help,\" he says she screamed. \"He's trying to kill me.\"\n\nLater, fans saw the brutal results of the incident in a distressing and bloody photo of Rihanna. \"Her lip was busted,\" says Brown. \"She had a knot because I pushed her head up against the window.

Perhaps that's why he's decided to make a documentary titled \"Chris Brown: Welcome To My Life\" to let people in on how tough it is for your own shameful decisions to derail your career.\n\nBefore Brown started beating up on Rihanna, he cheated on her, which is apparently when everything fell apart for the former couple.\n\n\"My trust totally was lost with her,\" Brown explained. \"She hated me after that. I tried everything, she didn't care. She just didn't trust me after that. From there, it just went downhill because there were too many verbal fights, physical fights as well. Mutual sides.\"\n\n\"We would fight each other. She would hit me, I would hit her and it never was OK,\" Brown admitted.\n\nI'm all for gender equality-and some hardcore feminists might disagree with me here-but one of the few things a man should never, ever do is hit a woman. Chris Brown admitted to doing just that on multiple occasions, realized how messed up it was, and then did it again anyways.\n\n\"There was always a point where we'd talk about it like, 'What the f-k are we doing?'\" Brown said. \"Like, 'I don't like you slapping me.' If I go on stage I got a scratch on my face and I gotta explain it like, 'Oh, no I fell.' If you got a scar or a bruise you gotta put makeup on. I'm not ever trying to put my hands on any female.\"\n\nThis is all before the night that the \"Look At Me Now\" singer flew off the handle and beat Rihanna bloody leading to his arrest. On that night, Brown recalls, Rihanna found text messages from unknown woman on his phone and lost it.\n\n\"She starts going off, she throws the phone,\" Brown said. \"'I hate you.' Starts hitting me. She hits me a couple of more times and it doesn't go from translation to 'let's sit down, I'm telling you the truth.' It goes to, 'Now, I'm going to be mean, be evil.'\"\n\n\"I remember she tried to kick me, but then I really hit her, with a closed fist, I punched her. I busted her lip,\" Brown admitted. \"When I saw it, I was in shock. I was like, 'F-k, why the hell did I hit her?'\"\n\nDon't anybody go feeling sorry for Chris now, no matter how much he may want you to. Brown wants people to believe he feels remorse and is even taking responsibility for his actions, but getting arrested didn't even slow him down. A few years after he and Rihanna ended things Brown found a new girlfriend to beat up on who he allegedly punched, threw down a flight of stairs and threatened to kill.\n\nI don't care how much Brown regrets his actions now, and you shouldn't either. Beating women is not addictive. It's not a disease. Raising a fist to a woman one time is one time too many, but the guy is still out here throwing hands and making a documentary pleading for sympathy when all he really deserves is some more jail time.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "wgt": 100, "id": 69, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities", "wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "wgt": 100, "id": 244, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period", "wgt": 100, "id": 286, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World_Literature", "wgt": 100, "id": 549, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World Literature"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Beauty", "wgt": 100, "id": 859, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Beauty"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Periods_and_Movements", "wgt": 100, "id": 950, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Periods and Movements"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302961", "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rihanna", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "308825", "label": {"eng": "Rihanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311299", "label": {"eng": "Feminism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "317021", "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "342020", "label": {"eng": "Chris Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_at_Me_Now_(Chris_Brown_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "769781", "label": {"eng": "Look at Me Now (Chris Brown song)"}}]}

I would hit her, but it never was okay.\"\n\nBrown, whose newest project, Heartbreak on a Full Moon, will be a double album releasing on Halloween, goes on to reveal that he was contemplating the idea of marrying Rihanna when she asked him about one of his exes who worked for him in the past. He lied, and that's when the pop superstar lost trust in him.\n\nOn the night he was arrested for assaulting Rihanna, Brown says she became upset when his ex showed up at music legend Clive Davis' pre-Grammy party, even after she was told to stay away from Brown. At the time, Brown had told Rihanna that he didn't know his ex would be in attendance, but Rihanna found a text the ex sent him saying she'd be there.\n\nApparently, that lie played a role in the physical altercation Brown and Rihanna would get into a short time later. Brown says Rihanna kicked him and he responded by punching her with a closed fist.\n\n\"I punched her and it busted her lip,\" he reveals. \"When I saw it, I was in shock, like, 'Fuck.

From there, she spits in my face, spits blood in my face, and it enraged me even more so it's a real-on fight in the car.\"\n\nBrown then says Rihanna grabbed his scrotum, and he responded by biting her arm. All of this took place while they were cruising around a Hollywood neighborhood in a Lamborghini. Brown says once he pulled up to Hancock Park, Rihanna pretended to launch his keys out of the window and shouted for help. \"He's trying to kill me,\" Brown says she shouted.\n\nIn the aftermath, fans saw the image of a badly beaten Rihanna, and both she and Brown's lives changed significantly.\n\n\"Her lip was busted,\" says Brown. \"She had a knot because I pushed her head up against the window.

Before we were together, me and this woman did have sex.'\n\nThe With You singer went on: 'My trust was totally lost with her. She hated me after that.

It was always a point to where we talk about it like, \"What the fuck are we doing\".'\n\nThe assault which occurred on February 8, 2009, happened after the woman Chris had slept with showed up at the Clive Davis party Chris and Rihanna had attended.\n\nHe said: 'I made sure the person I was involved with before, I said hey, you can't come around to these places. And the person comes in, comes right to the table and says, \"Hey what's up y'all.\" And I already know it's an issue, so I say \"Hey cool\" and I keep it moving.\n\n'I look over at Rihanna and she's bawling, she's crying.'\n\nThe couple argued following this, with Chris admitting to punching Rihanna as they drove in his rented Lamborghini.\n\nIn the graphic interview, Chris said that Rihanna was 'spitting blood'.\n\nBrown was found guilty of felony assault and was sentenced to five years probation.\n\nWelcome To My Life is available on DVD and Blu-Ray.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted Rihanna's rep for comment.\n\nFor support regarding domestic abuse, call the National Domestic Abuse Helpline 24 hours a day on 0808 2000 247.\n\nMORE: Chris Brown says Rihanna was 'spitting blood' as he recalls pre-Grammys assault\n\nMORE: Women's domestic abuse charity criticises Jeremy McConnell's 'lenient' sentence", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "wgt": 100, "id": 121, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Women"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities", "wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "wgt": 100, "id": 228, "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "wgt": 100, "id": 229, "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "wgt": 100, "id": 232, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100, "id": 544, "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302546", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302866", "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303499", "label": {"eng": "Short Message Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304627", "label": {"eng": "Grammy Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306307", "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rihanna", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "308825", "label": {"eng": "Rihanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "309577", "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "315461", "label": {"eng": "Metro (British newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "318168", "label": {"eng": "DVD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "342020", "label": {"eng": "Chris Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julianne_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "343348", "label": {"eng": "Julianne Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "357814", "label": {"eng": "Google+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "463661", "label": {"eng": "Umbrella (song)"}}]}

In a new film documentary, Chris Brown: Welcome to My Life, he goes into detail about the abusive relationship, saying he \"felt like a fucking monster\".\n\nHe said that he had intended to marry Rihanna, but that he lost her trust after he lied about a sexual encounter with someone who worked with him, that happened prior to their relationship. \"She hated me after that. I tried everything, she didn't care. She just didn't trust me after that,\" he said. \"From there, it just went downhill because there were too many verbal fights, physical fights as well. Mutual sides... We would fight each other. She would hit me, I would hit her and it never was OK.\n\n\"There was always a point where we'd talk about it like, 'What the fuck are we doing?'\" he continued. \"Like, 'I don't like you slapping me.' If I go on stage I got a scratch on my face and I gotta explain it like, 'Oh, no I fell.' If you got a scar or a bruise you gotta put makeup on. I'm not ever trying to put my hands on any female.\"\n\nDiscussing the specific incident he was arrested over, he said it came about after Rihanna became suspicious of texts he had received from another woman. \"She's fighting me, and I'm like: I'm telling you the truth, I swear to God, stop it. She hits me a couple more times, and it doesn't go from translation: sit down, I'm trying to tell you the truth. It goes to: now I'm finna be me, and be evil... She tried to kick me... and I really hit her, with a closed fist, I punched her. When I saw it, I was in shock, I was like, fuck, why did I hit her. She spit blood in my face - and it raised me even more ... She grabbed my nuts, and I bit her arm.\" Referring to the picture of her injuries that circulated the media afterwards, he said: \"I look back at that picture and I'm just like: that's not me. I hate it to this day - that's going to haunt me forever.\"\n\nIn a 2009 interview following the attack, Rihanna said she \"fended him off with my feet\". She added that Brown allegedly threatened to kill her, \"to scare me\", and that \"all I kept thinking was, 'When is it going to stop?'\" She characterised their relationship as \"dangerous\": \"The more in love we became, the more dangerous we became for each other, equally as dangerous.\"\n\nIn the documentary, Brown also recalls how they kept their \"fairytale\" relationship secret for eight months before going public at an awards ceremony. \"Our power that we had at that age, it was dangerous... real life rock stars, at 16, 17 years old, that's dangerous, because you can do whatever you want.\" He also asserts: \"I still love Rihanna\".\n\nBrown's career was briefly derailed by the assault incident, with radio stations refusing to play his songs, but he has since had a string of hits including Loyal, Yeah 3x, and Don't Wake Me Up.

After that, I tried everything. She didn't care, she just didn't trust me after that.

He claims it Rihanna. \"I look over at Rihanna and she's bawling, she's crying. She got over it. She started drinking a little bit, we both was drinking a little bit. We was tipsy, laughing and then we left.\"\n\nIn the car home, he says the Umbrella star saw a text from the woman which led her to believe that the singer knew she would be there. They had an argument about it and things erupted into violence. \"I remember she tried to kick me, but then I really hit her,\" Chris recalled. \"With a closed fist, like I punched her and it busted her lip. And when I saw it. I was in shock, I was like, 'Why did I hit her like that'?

This upset Rihanna and she burst into tears. Chris initially managed to calm her down, but on the way home, after a few drinks, things escalated.\n\nChris handed Rihanna his phone to prove that there were no suspicious messages from the unnamed woman on there, but Rihanna found an unread message from her saying she'd be at the party.\n\nChris said in the documentary: \"She starts going off, she throws the phone, 'I hate you!', whatever, whatever, she starts hitting me, we're in a little Lamborghini, you know she's fighting me.\n\n\"Like I remember she tried to kick me, just like her beating shit, but then I really hit her.

While the two quickly developed a connection and fell head over heels in love, their relationship went sour after Brown admitted to Rih that he'd slept with someone else prior to their relationship, something he had previously denied.\n\n\"My trust totally was lost with her,\" said Brown. \"She hated me after that. I tried everything, she didn't care. She just didn't trust me after that. From there, it just went downhill because there were too many verbal fights, physical fights as well. Mutual sides.\"\n\n\"We would fight each other. She would hit me, I would hit her and it never was OK,\" he confessed. Despite realizing the harm they were causing each other, the \"Loyal\" crooner confessed that they struggled to contain their feuds. \"There was always a point where we'd talk about it like, 'What the f -- are we doing?'\" he said. \"Like, 'I don't like you slapping me.'

According to Brown, everything came to a head when the unidentified woman he previously had sex with approached the pair at the event.\n\n\"The ceremony's about to start, she's just crying,\" Brown recalled, insisting he didn't know the young woman would be in attendance. \"She got over it. She started drinking a little bit, we both was drinking a little bit. We were both drinking a little bit, laughing, joking. And then we left.\" That same night, Brown claims that the \"We Found Love\" singer discovered a text message from the woman on Brown's phone, leading her to think the pair had conspired to meet up at the event.\n\n\"She starts going off, she throws the phone,\" he said. \"'I hate you.' Starts hitting me... She hits me a couple of more times and it doesn't go from translation to 'let's sit down, I'm telling you the truth.' It goes to, 'Now, I'm going to be mean, be evil.'\"\n\n\"I remember she tried to kick me, but then I really hit her, with a closed fist, I punched her.

We've heard her speak on the assault more than once. We've heard him apologize for it more than once. But what we haven't really heard much about is their relationship before the violent attack.\n\nIn a new documentary that he's behind called Chris Brown: Welcome To My Life, the 28-year-old speaks in depth about their relationship, how it started, the highs, as well as the violent lows and how it all fell apart.\n\n\"Through passing we would be on the same shows,\" he said of their early beginnings. \"She would always perform and then go sit in the crowd. She watched my shows so I was nervous. 'Do she like me?' I didn't know if she liked me or not. But I was like, 'She's really watching the shows so she actually must like my music.' So from there we became friends, kick it. Nothing too serious, but we just had a good understanding of each other.\"\n\nThey would go on to have a pretty intense relationship, not only in moving fast emotionally, but according to Brown, in terms of physical altercations. Things took an especially sour note in their relationship when Brown, feeling like he wanted to be honest with Rihanna as their relationship progressed and were in love, admitted that he slept with a former employee before they dated. The singer had previously lied and said he wasn't involved with the woman.\n\n\"My trust totally was lost with her,\" he said. \"She hated me after that. I tried everything, she didn't care. She just didn't trust me after that. From there, it just went downhill because there would be fights, verbal fights, physical fights as well. Mutual sides. This is the first time I get to say anything. Like I said, I still love Rihanna, but I'm just going to be honest. We would fight each other. She would hit me, I would hit her and it never was OK. There was always a point to where we'd talk about it like, 'What the f-k are we doing? Like, I don't like you slapping me.' If I go on stage I got a scratch on my face and I gotta explain it like, 'Oh, no I fell.' If you got a scar or a bruise you gotta put makeup on. I felt like s-t. I'm not ever trying to put my hands on any female. Me, I felt like a f-king monster.\"\n\nBut those feelings didn't stop things from escalating the night of Clive Davis's pre-Grammys event in 2009. After the former employee surprisingly showed up at the party, things came to a head. After drinking at the party, the couple argued about the woman's presence on their way home and when Rihanna found a recent message from her in Brown's phone, the infamous incident happened.\n\n\"She starts going off, she throws the phone,\" he said. \"'I hate you.' Starts hitting me. We're in a little Lamborghini. She's fighting me and I'm like, 'Look, I'm telling you the truth. I swear to God I'm telling you the truth. Stop it.' She hits me a couple of more times and it doesn't go from translation to 'Let's sit down, I'm telling you the truth.' It goes to, 'Now, I'm going to be mean, be evil.'\"\n\nHe wasn't kidding.\n\n\"I remember she tried to kick me, her just being upset. But then I really hit her, with a closed fist, I punched her,\" he said. \"I busted her lip. When I saw it, I was in shock. I was like, 'F-k, why the hell did I hit her?' From there she just spit in my face. Spit blood in my face and it enraged me even more. It's a real-on fight in a car.\"\n\nBrown admitted that things went beyond too far, with the star eventually biting and pushing her head against the window.\n\n\"It's just a petty, stupid fight and I'm just realizing it like, 'What the hell am I doing?'\" he said. \"'You honestly doing this in a car right now? What are we doing?'\"\n\nWhile his actions over the years may not prove that Brown truly got help and is a changed person in terms of his temper, incidents of violence and treatment of women, looking back on the incident that changed he and Rihanna's lives (as well as the remaining police picture of the aftermath), he says it still haunts him.\n\n\"I look back at that picture and I'm just like, yo bro, that's not me, bro. That's not me,\" Brown said. \"I hate it, to this day.

A clip from the documentary was posted Monday on a Facebook fan account dedicated to the \"Loyal\" singer. Brown delves into his previous relationship, to which he takes into consideration how quickly things had progressed.\n\n\"A year and a half into the relationship with Rihanna, I was really serious about it,\" Brown recalls in the clip. \"I was always goofy about everything else, being a young kid, but the maturity level I had in my beliefs and what I wanted with my girlfriend... 'You know what, I wanna marry you. But before we go any further I just want to be completely honest and real with you about everything you've ever had a question or doubt about.'\"\n\nBrown later informed Rihanna about a sexual encounter that occurred prior to their relationship, an encounter he had previously lied about.\n\n\"My trust totally was lost with her, she hated me after that. I tried everything, she didn't care. She just didn't trust me after that,\" Brown said. \"From there, it just went downhill because there were too many verbal fights, physical fights as well.

I'm not ever trying to put my hands on any female.\"\n\nHe added, \"I felt like a f -- king monster.\"\n\nDJ Khaled was also featured in the clip. He commented on the \"test\" Brown had to undergo with Rihanna, saying, \"That was his girl, you know what I'm saying? So, I feel like what he went through was a test. It wasn't so much so that the situation. I think it was just a test in life.\"\n\nBrown voluntarily turned himself into local law enforcement after he assaulted Rihanna following Clive Davis' Grammy's event February 2009. TMZ obtained pictures of the singer's face after the attack, which quickly circulated on the internet. Rihanna's face in the photos appeared to be severely bruised and bloody.\n\nRihanna spoke with Diane Sawyer about the incident during an appearance on \"20/20\" in November 2009. Describing the experience, she recalled, \"When is it going to stop? When is it going to stop? He had no soul in his eyes. Just blank. He was clearly blacked-out. There was no person when I looked at him.\"\n\nShe continued, \"I couldn't take that he kept lying to me, and he couldn't take that I wouldn't drop it. ... It escalated into him being violent towards me. And it was ugly.\"\n\nNew details of Chris Brown (L) and Rihanna's (R), pictured February 10, 2013, abusive relationship surfaced Tuesday.

She started drinking a little bit, we both was drinking a little bit. We was tipsy, laughing and then we left.\"\n\nIn the car after the event, Rihanna saw a text message from the woman, which led her to believe that Brown knew she would be there, the rapper explains. \"She starts going off, she throws the phone...'I hate you,'\" he recalls. \"She hits me a couple more times.\"\n\nThings quickly took a turn, recalls Brown, who was driving the car. \"I remember she tried to kick me, but then I really hit her, with a closed fist, I punched her.

I tried everything, she didn't care. She just didn't trust me after that.\n\n\"From there, it just went downhill because there were too many verbal fights, physical fights as well. Mutual sides.

If I go on stage I got a scratch on my face and I gotta explain it like, 'Oh, no I fell'. If you got a scar or a bruise you gotta put makeup on. I'm not ever trying to put my hands on any female.\n\nThe rapper also confesses that things escalated quickly on that infamous night after that same woman he had an encounter with came up to him to say hello at the pre-Grammys Clive Davis party. This made Rihanna unhappy and they got into a fight on the way home.\n\n\"I remember she tried to kick me, just like her beating s**t, but then I really hit her.

She just didn't trust me after that. From there, it just went downhill because there were too many verbal fights, physical fights as well. Mutual sides. ... We would fight each other. She would hit me, I would hit her and it never was okay.\"\n\nSpeaking of the night of the attack, Brown says it started because the former flame was at the same party as them and as they drove home, he received a text message from her.\n\n\"She[Rihanna] starts going off, she throws the phone,\" he says. \"'I hate you.' Starts hitting me. We're in a little Lamborghini. She's fighting me. I'm like, 'Look, I'm telling you the truth, I swear.' ...\n\n\"She hits me a couple of more times and it doesn't go from translation to, 'Let's sit down, I'm telling you the truth.' It goes to, 'Now, I'm going to be mean, be evil.' I remember she tried to kick me, but then I really hit her, with a closed fist, I punched her. I busted her lip. When I saw it, I was in shock. I was like, 'F--k, why the hell did I hit her?'\n\n\"So from there she's ... spitting blood in my face, it raised me even more. It's a real fight in the car, and we driving in the street.\"\n\nHe then describes how the fight continued and he bit her. Brown says he wasn't aware of the full weight of what he'd done until he saw the pictures of Rihanna's battered face.\n\nHe says that he felt like a \"f--king monster\" for what he had done.\n\n\"I look back at that picture and I'm like, 'That's not me, bro,'\" he says. \"I hate it to this day. That's going to haunt me forever.\"\n\nAs it should.\n\nBrown has repeatedly said he should be allowed to forget the incident and move on with his life.\n\nIndeed, when he was refused an Australia visa, he said he should be allowed to be an advocate of domestic violence (REALLY).\n\nPost continues after video\n\nBrown said he would be \"grateful\" to come to Australia to \"raise awareness about domestic violence.\"\n\nHe added that his \"life mistakes should be a wake-up call for everyone.\"\n\nHowever, shocking allegations have plagued the singer long after he attacked Rihanna in 2009.\n\nHis ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran filed a restraining order against him in February claiming he had been physically violent and threatened to kill her.\n\nIn a sworn statement revealed by TMZ Karrueche says Chris \"told a few people that he was going to kill me.\"\n\nShe also says Chris vowed to \"take me out,\" and \"threatened to shoot me,\" telling friends that if he couldn't have the 28-year-old model, nobody could.\n\nKarrueche claims Chris also 'punched me in my stomach twice' and 'pushed me down the stairs,' a few years ago, while he was still on probation for assaulting his ex-girlfriend Rihanna.\n\nIn 2016, model Liziane Gutierrez also claimed that she was punched by Chris in the face at a Las Vegas party, although charges were never laid for the alleged assault.\n\nOh, and there was also that whole 'police stand-off' debacle where he holed himself up over an alleged firearm offence.\n\nWe're not sure the 'reformed character' shoe fits you, Chris.\n\nIn Australia, one woman dies every week at the hands of domestic violence.

From the sound of things, the relationship with Rihanna was turbulent from the very start, and he said that while the infamous fight in the car was bad, it was not exactly a departure from their everyday life.\n\n\"We would fight each other, she would hit me, I would hit her, and it never was okay. It was always a point where when we would talk about it, like yo, what the fuck are we doing?\" Brown said. \"Me, I felt like a fucking monster.\"\n\nBrown talked about the relationship between the couple from his perspective, explaining that a lie he told about his sexual history led to the fracture of their trust. That set the scene for the fight they got into during a pre-Grammy party in 2009, allegedly over a text Brown received from another woman.\n\nThough Brown highlighted violent things Rihanna did in the car that night, ultimately he looked back and felt deep regret over what happened.\n\n\"I really hit her, with a closed fist, I punched her, and busted her lip. And when I saw it I was in shock,\" he said. \"From there, she just spit in my face, spitting blood on my face, so it enraged me even more, it's a real fight in the car ... a lot of the times I just look back at that picture and I'm just like, that's not me bro, that's not me. I hate it to this day. That's going to haunt me forever.\"\n\nIt should haunt him forever, because treating anyone like that, let alone someone you claim to loved and want to marry, is straight up unacceptable. But the larger problem with Brown's assertion over how bad he felt is that this so-called \"haunting\" has done little to impact his treatment of women in the years since the Rihanna incident. Karrueche Tran was granted a five-year restraining order against Brown just this June, with a judge weighing evidence of abuse from Brown in a court setting. A man who claims to be haunted by his past domestic violence would probably not be saying, \"Bitch I will beat the shit out of you,\" as Brown reportedly did to Tran through text message.\n\nYou can watch the video of Brown discussing the Rihanna abuse below, and maybe you'll buy that his contrition is genuine. Still, it should give you pause when supporting any new music of his, like his new single, \"Questions.\" Along with the song, he announced his album Heartbreak on a Full Moon will be released on Oct. 31 (Halloween).\n\nHEARTBREAK ON A FULL MOON!

Per a clip from the A-lister's documentary Chris Brown: Welcome to My Life, both Brown and RiRi were abusive in their highly profiled relationship.\n\nRelated: Chris Should Stay Out Of Rihanna's Instagram Comments\n\nApparently, things first went south for the couple when the hitmaker decided to tell the Work artist about a woman he slept with prior to their relationship, a tidbit he had previously lied about. On losing Rihanna's trust, Chris relayed:\n\n\"My trust totally was lost with her, she hated me after that. I tried everything, she didn't care. She just didn't trust me after that. From there, it just went downhill because there were too many verbal fights, physical fights as well. Mutual sides. It is the first time I get to say anything. We would fight each other. She would hit me, I would hit her and it never was OK.\"\n\nSupposedly, the twosome tried to stop their fighting as Brown continued:\n\n\"There was always a point where we'd talk about it like, 'What the fuck are we doing?' Like, 'I don't like you slapping me.' If I go on stage I got a scratch on my face and I gotta explain it like, 'Oh, no I fell.' If you got a scar or a bruise you gotta put makeup on. I'm not ever trying to put my hands on any female...I felt like a fucking monster.\"\n\nAlthough, the 28-year-old was unable to keep that promise as the violence between the two escalated and resulted in Chris bashing Rihanna's face in at a Grammys event. He says the whole thing began when the woman he had previously slept with was at the Clive Davis event and approached the couple:\n\n\"The ceremony's about to start, she's just crying...She got over it. She started drinking a little bit, we both was drinking a little bit. We was tipsy, laughing and then we left.\"\n\nHowever, while Brown says he didn't know the woman would be there, he apparently later got a text (which Rihanna saw) that implied he might've known. The singer revealed:\n\n\"She starts going off, she throws the phone...'I hate you.' She hits me a couple more times. I remember she tried to kick me, but then I really hit her, with a closed fist, I punched her. I busted her lip. When I saw it, I was in shock. I was like, 'Fuck' why the hell did I hit her? From there she just spit in my face, spit blood in my face and it enraged me even more. She takes the keys out of the car and fakes it like she throws them out of the window. I get out the car and I'm looking for the keys and somebody yelled and she yells out her door, 'Help, he's trying to kill me.'\"\n\nWell, it certainly is interesting to hear so much about this infamous night from Brown himself. He reveals even more about their relationship, the abuse, and how he feels about how everything went down in the video.\n\nWe do hope this is a sign of Brown growing up and changing for the better.

He also addressed the fact that they kept their relationship quiet for about 8 months, until their coming out ceremony, if you will, at the VMAs when they performed together and the chemistry and attraction between the two was undeniable.\n\nBut when Brown fessed up to Rihanna that he'd had a sexual relationship with someone who worked for him, the trust broke and the relationship turned toxic, reports The Guardian.\n\n\"She hated me after that. I tried everything, she didn't care. She just didn't trust me after that,\" he said. \"From there, it just went downhill because there were too many verbal fights, physical fights as well. Mutual sides... We would fight each other. She would hit me, I would hit her and it never was OK.\"\n\nWhile at first blush, this smacks of Donald Trump-style \"both sides are to blame\" doublespeak, it jives with what Rihanna said about their relationship in 2009.\n\n\"The more in love we became, the more dangerous we became for each other, equally as dangerous,\" she said, according to MTV News.\n\nThe blow-by-blow details of the night in the Lamborghini provide, for the first time, Chris' perspective on how things went down that night.\n\n\"She's fighting me, and I'm like: I'm telling you the truth, I swear to God, stop it. She hits me a couple more times, and it doesn't go from translation: sit down, I'm trying to tell you the truth. It goes to: now I'm finna be me, and be evil... She tried to kick me... and I really hit her, with a closed fist, I punched her. When I saw it, I was in shock, I was like, fuck, why did I hit her. She spit blood in my face - and it raised me even more ... She grabbed my nuts, and I bit her arm.\" Referring to the picture of her injuries that circulated the media afterwards, he said: \"I look back at that picture and I'm just like: that's not me. I hate it to this day - that's going to haunt me forever.\"\n\nThe way in which he narrates the story is in this rambling fashion, which makes it hard to follow. Chris' thoughts run a thousand miles a minute and he's wrestling with the pain and truth of what he's admitting to. A better documentarian might have helped Chris breathe, slow down and explain this in a more eloquent fashion. But since this documentary is essentially a money grab from Team Breezy itself, this is what we get.\n\nGiven that this documentary, which is for sale on Chris' site, is produced by him and his camp, it's surprising they even devoted this much time discussing and dissecting something that Chris has run away from addressing in public ever again. Remember, in 2011, Chris Brown went Incredible Hulk on the set of GMA because the journalists dared ask him about the incident.\n\nSo far, Rihanna has not offered any kind of reaction to Chris' documentary. She's too busy selling a collection of socks that bear her likeness on them to worry about Christopher's feelings.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "wgt": 100, "id": 121, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Women"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities", "wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "wgt": 100, "id": 232, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100, "id": 544, "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "wgt": 100, "id": 620, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Techniques_and_Styles", "wgt": 100, "id": 1380, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Techniques and Styles"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "302942", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "303358", "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306262", "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rihanna", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "308825", "label": {"eng": "Rihanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usher_(entertainer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "313155", "label": {"eng": "Usher (entertainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimeo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "326912", "label": {"eng": "Vimeo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_Video_Music_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "330195", "label": {"eng": "MTV Video Music Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "342020", "label": {"eng": "Chris Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "357157", "label": {"eng": "MTV News"}}]}

She would hit me, I would hit her and it never was okay.\"\n\nThen, on the night of Clive Davis' 2009 Grammy party, Brown and Rihanna got into a major argument after the woman approached the couple at the celeb-studded fete. Brown remembers looking over at Rihanna and seeing her \"bawling.\"\n\nAfter they left the party, he says he offered her his phone to look through as proof of his loyalty; she spotted a message from her and surmised that Brown had lied to her again.\n\n\"She starts going off, she throws the phone,\" he says. \"'I hate you.' Starts hitting me. We're in a little Lamborghini. She's fighting me. I'm like, 'Look, I'm telling you the truth, I swear.' ... She hits me a couple of more times and it doesn't go from translation to, 'Let's sit down, I'm telling you the truth.' It goes to, 'Now, I'm going to be mean, be evil.' I remember she tried to kick me, but then I really hit her, with a closed fist, I punched her. I busted her lip. When I saw it, I was in shock. I was like, 'Fuck, why the hell did I hit her?'\"\n\nHe says that he felt like a \"fucking monster\" for what he had done, and later, when he saw the police photo of Rihanna's bruised and battered face, he felt the full weight of what he had done.\n\n\"I look back at that picture and I'm like, 'That's not me, bro,'\" he says. \"I hate it to this day.

When he and Rihanna were an item, they seemingly had the perfect thing going. However, once word came out that Brown physically abused RiRi, a dark cloud was placed over the male singer's moral compass that he hasn't quite been able to escape in the years since. In a recently released snippet from his documentary Chris Brown: Welcome To My Life, the film's subject broke down the night he lost control in graphic detail.\n\nBefore he goes to that dark place however, Brown breaks down how he met Rihanna and that, when he suggested that they be more than just friends, she scoffed at the idea. \"She said, 'You ain't sure, I don't think you wanna do that.' She was like, 'You ain't ready.' I was like, 'Nah, I am, I'm ready, for real,\" detailed Brown, who later confesses that he told Rihanna, in that moment, that he loved her. In fact, prior to their MTV VMA performance together, Brown said that they had already been dating for about 8 months. Their relationship seemed to be progressing without any tremendous conflict, but that all changed the night of February 8th, 2009.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Brown explained that the incident all started when RiRi was going through his text messages and found something she wasn't too keen on. Things allegedly escalated quickly, with his recollection being that \"she tried to kick me, but then I really hit her, with a closed fist, I punched her.\" It gets worse from there: \"I busted her lip.

The pair briefly reunited after the assault before separating again in May 2013.\n\nIn a clip from the documentary, Brown explained that he told Rihanna he had slept with a girl that worked for him and added that she no longer trusted him after he told her and they began to fight - both verbally and physically - on a regular basis.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nBrown says that he told Rihanna: \"Before we were together me and this other girl did have sex.\"\n\nRelated ArticleKarrueche Tran granted Chris Brown restraining order\n\nHe continued: \"My trust was totally lost with her, she hated me after that. I tried everything, she didn't care, she just didn't trust me after that.\n\n\"From there it just went downhill, it would be fights, it would be verbal fights, physical fights as well, mutual sides.\n\n\u00a9 Getty Images/Christopher Polk\n\n[Rihanna and Chris Brown at the 55th annual Grammy Awards]\n\n\"We would fight each other, she would hit me, I would hit her and it never was okay, it was always to a point and we'd talk like, 'What the f**k are we doing?'\"\n\nHe added that the pair were hiding their injuries when they went on stage or out in public. Chris then explained that Rihanna became upset when the girl he had slept with made an appearance before the Grammys, even though he had asked her not to.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nHe and Rihanna managed to resolve the situation and he claims they both left the event in good spirits. But after the ceremony, Brown explains that a fight broke out when Rihanna saw a message from the girl in his phone, saying she would see him at an after-party.\n\n\u00a9 Getty Images\n\n\"She starts going off, she throws the phone, 'I hate you, whatever, whatever', we're in a little Lamborghini, she's fighting me and I'm like look, 'I'm telling you the truth, swear to God, I'm telling you the truth, stop it',\" he said.\n\n\"She hits me a couple more times and I kinda just, it doesn't go from translation to, 'Let's sit down, I'm telling you the truth', it goes to now I'm feeling, be me. Be evil. Arguing, arguing, arguing.\n\n\"So then I remember she tried to kick me, just like her being upset, but then I really hit her, like with a closed fist, I punched her and it busted her lip and when I saw it, I was in shock.\n\n\"I was like, 'F**k, why did I hit her? But I hit her.' From there she's just spitting in my face, spitting blood in my face and it raised me even more.\"\n\n\u00a9 Getty Images Pool\n\nHe then added that Rihanna went to grab his phone and throw it out the window, then: \"She grabs my nuts and when she do that, I bite her arm, as I'm driving, as I'm still trying to drive.\"\n\nChris Brown went on to describe that he pulled over the car and explained to Rihanna that he didn't know this girl would be at the event, but she didn't believe him.\n\nHe told her she could drive herself home. \"By this time her lip was busted and she had an eye as I punched her head up against a window,\" he said.\n\n\"I look back at that picture [of Rihanna's injuries] and that's not me, that's not me. I hate it to this day, that's going to haunt me forever.\"\n\n\u00a9 Getty Images\n\nSpeaking to Vanity Fair in 2015 about the assault, Rihanna admitted she did think she could change the 'Loyal' singer, saying: \"A hundred percent. I was very protective of him. I felt that people didn't understand him. Even after... But you know, you realise after a while that in that situation you're the enemy.\n\n\"You want the best for them, but if you remind them of their failures, or if you remind them of bad moments in their life, or even if you say I'm willing to put up with something, they think less of you - because they know you don't deserve what they're going to give.\n\n\"And if you put up with it, maybe you are agreeing that you [deserve] this, and that's when I finally had to say, 'Uh-oh, I was stupid thinking I was built for this'. Sometimes you just have to walk away.\"\n\nChris Brown's documentary Welcome To My Life is out now.\n\nReaders who are affected by the issues raised in this story are encouraged to contact Refuge (www.refuge.org.uk) or Women's Aid (www.womensaid.org.uk).

Good, says Kat Brown\n\nI still remember the first time I saw the police shots of Rihanna's face in 2009 after her then-boyfriend, Chris Brown, had beaten her up. I gasped, I remember, like a Victorian aunt in shock - I knew this sort of thing happened to celebrities as it does to \"normals\", but surely not to celebrities like Rihanna? To me, naively, they seemed invulnerable. They gave off a power that seemed more like a force field. The idea that anyone would even dare was just...well.\n\nChris Brown has talked about what happened in a new documentary, Chris Brown: Welcome To My Life (no thanks), saying that their already volatile relationship - he claims they hit each other - went downhill after she discovered that he'd been sleeping with one of his employees, whom he had previously denied being involved with.\n\nThis woman subsequently turned up to parties attended by the couple, and after one event, Rihanna was left so distraught that, in the car on their way home, Brown offered her his phone as proof that he didn't know the woman was coming - only for Rihanna to find a text from her. She then hit out at him, and Brown retaliated.\n\nBrown said: \"Shit, I'm not ever trying to put my hands on any female. I felt like a fucking monster.\"\n\nIn the years since the attack, Rihanna has told of her devastation at losing the man she described as her \"best friend\" overnight, and the difficulty of coming to terms with their break-up in the glare of the public eye. And when you're caught in that kind of situation, it can feel impossible to imagine anything other than that.\n\nAbout 10 years ago I had a boyfriend who controlled me. He never hit me. Instead, he spent his time doing what I now know - thanks to a plot line in The Archers, of all things - is called gas-lighting. My instinct was telling me one thing, while the boyfriend was telling me another. I wasted months trying to make myself better, more suitable, catching the bus to the other end of London in the middle of the night if he asked for me, trying to fix what was apparently broken in myself so that he would like me more, and not go after his old lovers.\n\nI once hired a car and drove us for 11 hours up to Scotland so that we could see the mutual friend who introduced us, hoping it would make him happy - ironically, it was on that visit that I saw my now husband for the first time in six years. I remember thinking, \"Isn't he a nice man. Shame I'm such an awful witch.\"\n\nThe relationship limped on, eventually ending after I caught him sleeping with my friend while we were staying at her house. Weeks later, he called me on my birthday. \"Katten, I miss you,\" he said. \"Fuck off,\" I said. I remember screaming at him, briefly, in the loos at my new job, furious that he had brought his cloying, limp-dick misery into somewhere positive.\n\n\"Don't you ever call me again,\" I said. And this time, he didn't.\n\nAnd I moved on. And, crucially, albeit slowly, I did \"get better\" - not for a man, and not in the way of trying to make myself smaller so that I could be appreciated. I made myself into a person. I got therapy. I got more therapy. I started running. I found things I loved. And if people tried to break me, I didn't make myself small - I moved away.\n\nSo, Chris Brown. I'm glad you know what you are. I'm glad you feel that way.

Chris Brown, 28, admitted in his new film Welcome to My Life that he planned to propose to Rihanna, 29, when they were dating all those years ago. Fans were stunned to hear that he wanted to spend his life with a woman that he ended up assaulting.

See pics of the former flames, here.\n\n\"Chris wanted to get a reaction from Rihanna, that was the whole point of telling the world that he was planning to propose to her,\" the insider explained. \"He's been trying to get her attention and it hasn't really been working so he upped his game. And that still didn't work. Rihanna hasn't called, texted, nothing. He's disappointed, he was expecting something more to come out of it.\" Well, that's a major bummer for Chris.\n\nUnfortunately, Rihanna has recently moved on from her ex, though she did have feelings for him for years. Another insider told Hollywoodlife.com \"Rihanna barely speaks to Chris these days. She's aware that she really needs to move on from that chapter in her life and she's finally getting there.\" Chris can reach out all he wants, but it sounds like RiRi has made up her mind this time. \"Chris still sends her text messages, but she's doing her best to just ignore them.\"\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Chris and Rihanna will ever reconnect?

After the couple left the party, Chris says he offered to let Rihanna look through his phone to show he wasn't cheating but she spotted a message from the other woman and assumed he had lied again. Chris says that Rihanna started the violence, hitting him and attempting to kick him before he punched her in the face. (It should be noted that in the official police department affidavit of the incident from 2009 provided by a police officer, there is no mention of Rihanna attacking Chris.)\n\nHe says he felt like a \"f -- king monster\" after the incident and says that things really sunk in when he saw the police photo of Rihanna's bruised face. \"I look back at that picture and I'm like, 'That's not me, bro,'\" he says. \"I hate it to this day. That's going to haunt me forever.\"\n\nChris pled guilty and served five years probation and community service for the assault. The couple got back together briefly but broke up for good in 2013. Chris has since been accused of domestic violence by his ex Karrueche Tran, who obtained a restraining order against him in April according to the New York Daily News.\n\nWhile both men and women are certainly capable of abuse, Chris' portrayal of their relationship is problematic. Katie Ray-Jones, CEO of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, says that while we don't know the intricacies of his relationship with Rihanna, there often is a primary aggressor in an abusive relationship.\"The images we saw coming out of that instance, clearly you could see a battered woman who was hit very violently,\" she says. \"When we saw pictures of Chris, we did not see injuries to him. In relationships where there's violence, men have more capacity to cause physical harm.\"\n\nNews stressing you out? Try this relaxing yoga pose:\n\nChris continues to have many fans, many of whom seemed to imply on social media that the documentary clips justify his assault. This is a commonplace reaction, says Ray-Jones. \"We are operating in a culture where people try to rationalize violence and justify something that must have caused someone they admire to behave in a certain way,\" she says. And it's not limited to domestic violence -- many people (including celebrities) reacted similarly to the sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby.\n\nBut no matter who a person is, or what potentially \"provoked\" them, Ray-Jones says that it's important for people to understand that there is never an excuse for someone to put their hands on you. \"We want victims and survivors to know that being assaulted is never your fault,\" she says.\n\nRihanna hasn't commented publicly on the clip or documentary.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "wgt": 100, "id": 121, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Women"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "wgt": 100, "id": 203, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "wgt": 100, "id": 228, "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "wgt": 100, "id": 229, "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "wgt": 100, "id": 232, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302718", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302961", "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302965", "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302966", "label": {"eng": "Violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303465", "label": {"eng": "Departments of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_News_(New_York)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "304760", "label": {"eng": "Daily News (New York)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rihanna", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "308825", "label": {"eng": "Rihanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "329139", "label": {"eng": "Clive Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/51st_Annual_Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "446739", "label": {"eng": "51st Annual Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Domestic_Violence_Hotline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "576628", "label": {"eng": "National Domestic Violence Hotline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karrueche_Tran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1278685", "label": {"eng": "Karrueche Tran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cosby_sexual_assault_allegations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "1284658", "label": {"eng": "Bill Cosby sexual assault allegations"}}]}

In his documentary titled Welcome To My Life, the singer detailed the infamous domestic violence incident and confessed that he \"felt like a monster\" for what he did to the singing diva.\n\nIt all started during the Clive Davis' Grammy event in February 2009 when a woman, with whom the Loyal singer reportedly had a sexual relationship, approached the then couple leaving RiRi furious at him. \"The ceremony's about to start, she's just crying. She got over it. She started drinking a little bit, we both was drinking a little bit. We were both drinking a little bit, laughing, joking. And then we left,\" he recalled.\n\nHowever, later the Diamond singer broke down and Chris claims she started hitting him first. \"She starts going off, she throws the phone. 'I hate you.' Starts hitting me... She hits me a couple of more times and it doesn't go from translation to 'let's sit down, I'm telling you the truth.' It goes to, 'Now, I'm going to be mean, be evil,'\" he claims in the documentary.\n\nAt this point, the 28-year-singer lost his temper and said he stated hitting back at her in a fit of rage. \"I remember she tried to kick me, but then I really hit her, with a closed fist, I punched her. I busted her lip. When I saw it, I was in shock. I was like, 'F -- , why the hell did I hit her?'\"\n\nThe Barbadian singer was injured during the incident and Chris says she spat blood on him. \"So from there she's...spitting blood in my face, it raised me even more.\n\nIt's a real fight in the car, and we driving in the street,\" he added.\n\nThe R&B artist says he \"felt like a f -- ing monster\" after realising his actions and at that moment he lost his lady love. \"My trust totally was lost with her,\" he explains. \"She hated me after that. I tried everything, she didn't care. She just didn't trust me after that. From there, it just went downhill because there were too many verbal fights, physical fights as well. Mutual sides.\"\n\nSoon after the incident, Rihanna filed a domestic abuse case against her then boyfriend and eventually they broke up.

Victim blaming at its finest!\n\nThe rapper says it all started when he confessed to Riri that he had slept with a woman prior to their romance, and she just couldn't get it over it.\n\n\"My trust totally was lost with her, she hated me after that. I tried everything, she didn't care. She just didn't trust me after that. From there, it just went downhill because there were too many verbal fights, physical fights as well. Mutual sides. It is the first time I get to say anything. We would fight each other. She would hit me, I would hit her and it never was OK,\" he explained.\n\nThe pair recognized they had a problem, yet it persisted.\n\n\"There was always a point where we'd talk about it like, 'What the f -- k are we doing?' Like, 'I don't like you slapping me.' If I go on stage I got a scratch on my face and I gotta explain it like, 'Oh, no I fell.' If you got a scar or a bruise you gotta put makeup on. I'm not ever trying to put my hands on any female. I felt like a f-ing monster,\" he continued.\n\nThings reached a breaking point when that unidentified woman showed up unexpectedly at Clive Davis' pre-Grammy party.\n\n\"The ceremony's about to start, she's just crying. She got over it. She started drinking a little bit, we both was drinking a little bit. We was tipsy, laughing and then we left,\" he said about the singer's reaction.\n\nClearly the \"Wild Thoughts\" songstress wasn't over it, and when she saw a text message from the woman on Breezy's phone as they were driving home, all hell broke loose.\n\n\"She starts going off, she throws the phone...'I hate you.' She hits me a couple more times. I remember she tried to kick me, but then I really hit her, with a closed fist, I punched her. I busted her lip. When I saw it, I was in shock. I was like, 'F -- k' why the hell did I hit her? From there she just spit in my face, spit blood in my face and it enraged me even more.

According to Brown, the couple's relationship grew increasingly violent due to her trust issues.\n\nMost Popular\n\nHowever, Refuge - a leading domestic abuse charity - has asserted that there is never any excuse for a man to hit his partner and that violence is a \"choice\". It also stated that victim-blaming is a common tactic used to obtain control and deflect responsibility.\n\n\"Whatever goes wrong in a relationship, no man has a right to hit his partner. We all say and do things we later regret, but domestic violence does not 'take two,'\" Refuge CEO Sandra Horley told us.\n\n\"No woman can make a man hit her; violence is a choice he makes and he alone is responsible for it. Blaming the victim is another way perpetrators maintain control over their victims - it shifts the responsibility to the woman. Manipulating her into thinking she is responsible is a ploy abusers use to deflect from their violent and controlling behaviour. Hitting a woman is never acceptable behaviour - it is against the law.\"\n\nRelated Story Chris Brown opens up about Rihanna assault\n\nBrown pleaded guilty to felony assault and accepted a plea deal in 2009. He and Rihanna rekindled their relationship in 2013, but split up after a few months.\n\nAbuse charity Women's Aid also described Brown's interview as \"victim-blaming\" and outlined the dangers that such claims could have. The foundation's CEO, Katie Ghose, stressed that the perpetrator is \"solely responsible\" for his/her actions and that \"abuse or violence of any kind is never the victim's fault\".\n\n\"Despite pleading guilty to felony assault and accepting a plea deal, in this documentary Chris Brown is victim-blaming Rihanna for the horrific physical assault he perpetrated against her back in 2009,\" said Katie Ghose, Women's Aid chief executive.\n\n\"Brown is sending out a very dangerous message to both survivors and abusers by relieving himself of responsibility for his actions by blaming Rihanna for provoking him.\"\n\nGhose added that victim-blaming is commonplace and has dire impact on the victims.\n\n\"Women are frequently discouraged from coming forward for fear of being blamed for the abuse,\" she told us. \"Nearly half of domestic abuse survivors responding to a HMIC online survey had never reported the abuse to the police.\"\n\nIf you think you might be experiencing domestic violence, you are not alone.

Chris Brown, 28, let it slip that he's still got the feels about Rihanna when he posted a pair of googly-eyed emojis on an Instagram photo of her racy Crop Over Festival costume on Aug. 7.

When he commits to a relationship he falls hard, and Rihanna was one of his first real loves. I wouldn't say he's obsessed with her, he feels like she was the one who got away from him,\" a music industry insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\nShe literally got away from him after he was accused of beating the crap out of her following a pre-Grammy party in 2009. He pled guilty to felony assault and was ordered by the court to stay away from her. They later rekindled a bit of a friendship, but haven't been seen together in ages. \"Of course he accepts responsibility for what went down between them that night, but he is much older now and being a parent to a beautiful girl has given him a wealth of an entirely new perspective on what's important in life,\" our source continues.

The eye emoji comment was him telling her, 'Okay, I see you doing your thing out there.' He doesn't feel like he needs to compete with anyone but himself,\" our insider adds. Chris took a renewed interest in his ex back in March when he started following her Instagram again after months of not keeping tabs on her.

This isn't some sit down with Oprah and he didn't call up Iyanla to \"fix his life\" -- he put everything in a new documentary called \"Welcome to My Life.\"\n\n\"I really hit her with a closed fist, like, I punched her and it busted her lip,\" Chris says in a clip.\n\nChris' moment of truth is probably worth millions. After being released in movie theaters around the world, the documentary has quickly shot to number one in 15 countries -- and that's just on iTunes.\n\nWhile RiRi seems to be living a drama-free life since all that went down, we can't say the same for Chris.\n\nHis recent ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran filed a five-year restraining order against him back in June. She claims Chris abused her during their relationship and allegedly pushed her down a flight of stairs.\n\nChris brown denies those allegations.

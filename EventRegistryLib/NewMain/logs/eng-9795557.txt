He has been an outspoken critic of the violence which has erupted in England and Wales.\n\nThe failed SNP leader recently welcomed a third child with his wife Nadia El-Nakla but spoke of his fears about the growing unrest which has yet to spread north of the border. He was born in Scotland to Pakistani parents and became the first person of colour to lead the Scottish Government last year.\n\nMr Yousaf was interviewed on the Newsagents Podcast where he hinted that he may have to move to Pakistan to get away from the \"horrendous\" anti-migrant discourse in the UK. Far right demonstrations have happened in a number of UK towns and cities following the stabbings and deaths of three young girls in Southport.\n\nHe said: \"I was born in Scotland, raised in Scotland, educated in Scotland, just welcomed my third child here in Scotland, was the leader of the Scottish Government for just over a year, leader of the Scottish National Party, you cut me open, I'm about as Scottish as they come.\n\nREAD MORE: Humza Yousaf accused of wanting a 'holy war' following 'irresponsible' comments on UK riots\n\n\"But the truth of the matter is I don't know whether the future for me, my wife and my three children is going to be here in Scotland, the United Kingdom or even in Europe and the West because I have, for some time, been really worried about the rise of Islamophobia.. the rise of the far right driven by Islamophobia in Europe, UK and the West.\n\n\"You're now seeing the culmination of not years but decades of anti migrants, anti Muslim rhetoric being normalised discourse now playing out the most horrendous, violent way possible. That genuinely makes me question whether or not my family has an existence here in the UK or not.\n\n\"And by the way, I'm not the only one. I've had hundreds of messages from the Muslim community saying the exact same thing.\" Mr Yousaf then relayed an anecdote about his dat creating Pakistani identity cards and passports just in case they need to leave Scotland, and said he used to laugh at this thought.\n\nHowever, now he thinks \"it wasn't such a ridiculous suggestion.\" He added: \"I don't know where I would go, Scotland is the country I love, and the United Kingdom over the decades has a complicated history around race, a lot of countries do, but actually has a pretty positive story to tell on multiculturalism.\"\n\nThe former First Minister previously called for the army to be called in due to riots escalating in England and Northern Ireland, and labelled the fighting in Rotherham a \"pogrom\" against Muslims. He also slammed politicians across the spectrum for \"normalising far-right riots.\"\n\nHe has written to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to get her to categorise the English Defence League, founded by Tommy Robinson, as a terrorist organisation after they were blamed for some of the violence south of the border.\n\nNever miss the latest top headlines from the Scottish Daily Express.

violent riots", "body": "Humza Yousaf, the former first minister of Scotland, has revealed the recent days of violent riots have left him unsure whether his family has a future in the UK.\n\nMr Yousaf - the first ethnic minority leader of a devolved government and the first Muslim to lead a major UK party when he became SNP leader and Scotland's first minister in March 2023 - described the past week of unrest as \"utterly horrendous\".\n\nViolent disorder has taken place in cities across England and in Northern Ireland following the killings of three young girls in Southport last week.\n\nThe unrest has been fuelled by misinformation online relating to the attacker.\n\nPolice forces across the country are braced for further disturbances, with reports of at least 30 more gatherings due to take place on Wednesday evening.\n\nUK riots latest:\n\nThousands of extra police mobilised ahead of 30 far-right protests\n\nSpeaking to The News Agents podcast, Mr Yousaf said: \"I'm about as Scottish as they come.\n\n\"Born in Scotland, raised in Scotland, educated in Scotland, just welcomed my third child here in Scotland, was the leader of the Scottish government for just over a year, leader of the Scottish National Party.\n\n\"You cut me open, I'm as about as Scottish as you come.\n\n\"But the truth of the matter is, I don't know whether the future for me and my wife and my three children is going to be here in Scotland or the United Kingdom, or indeed in Europe and the West, because I have for some time really worried about the rise of Islamophobia.\"\n\nMr Yousaf, who resigned as first minister in May, said the rise of the far-right was \"driven by Islamophobia in Europe, the UK and the West\".\n\nHe said rioters were \"going after people who are black, who are Asian, who are Muslim, and that, again, comes back to some of the language that's been used far too often in our politics about people not adopting our values\".\n\nMr Yousaf, the MSP for Glasgow Pollok, said he has no idea where his family would go, adding that \"Scotland is the country I love\".\n\nHe said: \"I don't want to go, let me just make that abundantly clear.\"\n\nMr Yousaf said Scotland is not immune from racism or Islamophobia, but added the UK has a \"pretty positive story to tell on multiculturalism\".\n\nHe cited his own turn as first minister, as well as Rishi Sunak - a British Hindu prime minister, and Sadiq Khan - Muslim mayor of London.\n\nMr Yousaf added: \"So, we actually have a strong history and heritage of multiculturalism over the years, but that is quite literally, actually in some parts of the UK, going up in flames.\"\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has condemned the violence and has vowed to do \"whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice\".\n\nFirst Minister John Swinney met with members of Scotland's Muslim community at Edinburgh Central Mosque earlier this week.\n\nHe branded the violence across other parts of the UK as \"completely unacceptable\" and said it would not be tolerated in Scotland.\n\nThe first minister added: \"There is no place in Scotland for hatred of any kind, and each of us has a responsibility to confront racism and religious prejudice wherever and whenever it appears.\n\n\"People will always try to divide us - and it is imperative in these moments that we come together even stronger to stand defiant.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nHow the far-right hijacked Southport protests\n\nSnapshot of people in court over UK riots\n\nPolice Scotland said it is providing reassurance to communities through

He is now being tagged by many of those supporting the protests.\n\nIn an interview with The News Agents podcast, Mr Yousaf said: \"I don't know if my children will be safe in the UK with the rise of the far-right.\n\n\"Every Muslim I know is asking the same question: do we have a future here in the UK? We need to confront the far-right, we cannot let them win.\"\n\nAlthough there has been no rioting in Scotland, he said the last week had been \"utterly horrendous\" adding that it was a \"strange feeling when your very sense of belonging is questioned.\"\n\nHe said: \"I'm about as Scottish as they come. Born in Scotland, raised in Scotland, educated in Scotland. I have just welcomed my third child in Scotland. I was a leader of the Scottish Government for just over a year, leader of the Scottish National Party. You cut me open and I'm about as Scottish as you come.\n\n\"But the truth of the matter is I don't know whether the future for me and my wife and three children is going to be here in Scotland or in the United Kingdom, or indeed in Europe, or in the west because for some time I have really worried about the rise of Islamaphobia.\n\n\"We are now seeing the culmination of, not years, actually decades, of anti-migrant, anti-muslim rhetoric being normalised in our discourse now playing out in the most horrendous, violent way possible.\"\n\nHe added that he was \"not the only one\" to question whether or not he should stay in the UK. He said he had received \"hundreds of messages from the muslim community saying the same thing\".\n\nHis comments came as more protests are planned, including a big gathering in Newcastle Upon Tyne on Saturday.\n\nSocial media has been criticised for the spread of misinformation but the protestors - including supporters of the activist Tommy Robinson - say it is a more reliable source of information than the mainstream media.\n\nThe BBC came in for particular anger for initially ignoring gangs of Asians gathering in Birmingham and focusing its attention on the \"far right\" demonstrators.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has been dubbed \"two tier Keir\" for targeting \"concerned citizens\" while police presence is negligible for other groups gathering and wielding knives and machetes.\n\nHe was drawn into a war of words with Elon Musk who asked \"why aren't all communities being protected in Britain?\" and used the TwoTierKeir hashtag.\n\nHe posted it over a video of the Clumsy Swan pub in Birmingham, a scene of disorder in the city on Monday evening.\n\nThe Prime Minister was due to chair another emergency Cobra meeting this evening.\n\nHundreds of people have been arrested and the England and Wales' director of public prosecutions said he is willing to consider charging some of those joining the unrest with terrorism offences. He said that he is aware of \"at least one instance where that is happening\".\n\nThe violence has erupted while the Chancellor Rachel Reeves is touring North America to persuade institutions to invest in Britain.", "source": {"uri": "dailybusinessgroup.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Business"}, "authors": [{"uri": "terry_murden@dailybusinessgroup.co.uk", "name": "Terry Murden",

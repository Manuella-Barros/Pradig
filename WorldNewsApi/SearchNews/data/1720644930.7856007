The meeting in New York on Friday evening involved the \u201ctransaction committee\u201d of PGA Tour Enterprises and Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the governor of the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund that pays for rival LIV Golf. PGA Tour Enterprises is the commercial group that came out of the framework agreement announced a year ago among the PGA Tour, PIF and the European tour. PGA Tour Enterprises brought on Strategic Sports Group, which invested an initial $1.5 billion earlier this year. Negotiations are ongoing to bring in PIF as a minority investor, and there has been more activity than previously believed. Rory McIlroy, who joined Tiger Woods and Adam Scott on the transaction committee, said it has been meeting with PIF representatives every Monday, Wednesday and Friday over the last couple of weeks. The tour referred to negotiations as \u201caccelerated\u201d in recent months. Friday\u2019s meeting was the first in-person discussion since players and board members met with Al-Rumayyan in the Bahamas the day after The Players Championship in March. The tour said the committee and PIF have been meeting \u201cmultiple times weekly to work through potential deal terms and come to a shared vision on the future of professional golf.\u201d It said only that \u201cmore progress was made\u201d in New York. \u201cWe remain committed to these negotiations, which require working through complex considerations to best position golf for global growth,\u201d the tour said. Woods and Scott are on the full PGA Tour Enterprises board, along with player directors Jordan Spieth, Webb Simpson, Patrick Cantlay and Peter Malnati. McIlroy resigned from the PGA Tour board last November, and there was an unsuccessful attempt by Simpson to have McIlroy replace him. McIlroy, the strongest voice who has gone from heavy criticism of LIV to being more willing to compromise, is part of the transaction committee and ultimately does not have a vote. But he has relationships with both sides of the table. McIlroy had said he would be more in listen mode when the business leaders \u2014 Al-Rumayyan and his team at PIF, a PGA Tour Enterprises committee that includes four SSG investors \u2014 sorted through details. \u201cWe\u2019re there to maybe give a perspective from player\u2019s point of view,\u201d McIlroy had said Thursday. \u201cBut, I mean, this is a negotiation about an investment into PGA Tour Enterprises. This is \u2018big boy\u2019 stuff, and I\u2019ll certainly be doing more listening than I will be talking.\u201d ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf", "summary": "The PGA Tour is reporting progress without any details in its ongoing negotiations with the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia.

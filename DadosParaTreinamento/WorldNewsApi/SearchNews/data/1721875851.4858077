What can I do?\u2019", "text": "Planning was rejected, so the draughtsman submitted the plans to An Bord Plean\u00e1la, saying it would take six months to get a decision. After six months, I found out that planning had actually been rejected after three days \u2013 and An Bord Plean\u00e1la had returned the plans, along with my \u20ac250 fee, to the draughtsman. The draughtsman withheld this information and my money, and I\u2019ve been unable to contact him since August. I paid him \u20ac3,750 and am still repaying a loan for that amount. I didn\u2019t get a written contract or a receipt. What are my options? Margaret, Dublin A When you hire a draughtsman, you\u2019re buying their services, and consumer laws give you strong rights when you buy a product or service. When you agreed to pay the draughtsman for his work, you entered into a contract with him. Contracts can be written or verbal, but you\u2019re always in a stronger position when you have it in writing. Even though your agreement was verbal, this is still a legal contract Under the Consumer Rights Act (CRA) 2022, services supplied must comply with the terms in the contract, with any description or advertisement of the service, and with any statement from the trader. Even though no contract was signed and your agreement was verbal, this is still considered a contract and you have the right to have the issue resolved if you\u2019re unhappy with the work or completion of the job. Contact the draughtsman formally, in writing. Explain the issue and how you\u2019d like it resolved. Depending on what was agreed, you could argue that there was a breach of the CRA \u2013 the service supplied wasn\u2019t carried out with reasonable care and skill. Ask to be reimbursed part of what you paid for the service, or for the contract to be terminated and that you be given a full refund. If he\u2019s unwilling to give a full or partial refund, you\u2019ll need to take further action. We note you\u2019ve paid the draughtsman \u20ac3,750. If you\u2019re willing to accept a partial refund, you can take the matter to the Small Claims Court, bearing in mind that you can\u2019t claim for more than \u20ac2,000 and that there\u2019s a non-refundable fee of \u20ac25 to file a claim. It is, however, an inexpensive way to resolve disputes without needing a solicitor. Alternatively, you could consider taking formal legal action and seeking independent legal advice. If you feel that this could be a matter\u202finvolving\u202ffraud, contact your local garda station and report it. Issues around contracts can be complex, so if you need further clarification, please call the CCPC consumer helpline on (01) 402 5555 or visit ccpc.ie. \u2018I\u2019m Dirt exempt, but my bank branch refuses to accept the paperwork\u2019 Q I\u2019m exempt from paying Dirt and submitted DE1 forms to my credit union without any issue. But when I went to my bank, the staff \u2013 on the manager\u2019s instructions \u2013 refused to take my forms. I phoned the bank -customer service line and was told the forms should be accepted. I went back to the branch again \u2013 but they still refused to take them. I then called -customer services while I was at the branch and was told that if the manager refused again, there was nothing they could do. I explained my predicament to Revenue but the short answer from them was to leave forms at the bank. Can you help? James, Dublin A It sounds like you\u2019re doing everything right. The DE1 form is the correct form to mark an account as exempt from Dirt and this form should be handed directly into your financial institution. Perhaps the branch manager is unaware of the specific circumstances in which you are exempt? I recommend you now bypass the branch entirely and submit the form to your bank\u2019s head office, explain what happened, and ask for support in requesting that the branch manager accepts your form. You should also consider making a formal written complaint I don\u2019t know your -personal circumstances, but vulnerable customers must be provided with reasonable and enhanced customer supports under the Central Bank\u2019s Consumer Protection Code. This includes -additional services such as a dedicated phone line, priority hours in-branch, or dedicated support units. Check what your bank offers and consider reaching out to them this way, if appropriate. You should also consider making a formal written complaint if you\u2019re not satisfied with how your bank dealt with this situation. Include your account number and set out the facts, the relevant dates, and the names of people you dealt with. Outline the solution you want and attach copies of any relevant documents, making sure to keep the original documents. If the bank doesn\u2019t respond to your complaint or you\u2019re not happy with the outcome, you can complain to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO), which is an independent and free service. You can submit a complaint online, call (01) 5677000, or email info@fspo.ie. Gr\u00e1inne Griffin is director of communications at the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission\u200b.

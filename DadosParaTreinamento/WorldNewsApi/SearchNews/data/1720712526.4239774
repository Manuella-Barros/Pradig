The clash of Limerick and Clare was due to start at 4pm, but provincial council chiefs decided to put it back to 4.30pm after consultations. \u201cUnfortunately, we had a serious power outage in the whole area of Thurles in the last hour, and that has obviously affected the stadium here in Thurles as well,\u201d explained Munster Council PRO Dermot Lynch, when speaking to RT\u00c9\u2019s The Sunday Game. \u201cWe\u2019ve met with all the stakeholders, the Garda\u00ed, the event controllers and obviously the senior executive of the Munster Council. \u201cWe made the decision in the interest of health and safety that we will put back the game for 30 minutes to make sure everyone just gets into the ground safely. \u201cWe have issues as such as the scoreboard, HawkEye, even the public address, so safety is paramount at the moment. \u201cBoth county boards, secretaries, managers have been informed. They\u2019re going back into the dressing room and with the help of God, EBS are on touch to make sure that we get it back up and running again fairly soon. \u201cEverything has been affected, and once it goes down, unfortunately, it is one of these things that\u2019s totally out of our control, but there are people working very hard behind the scenes, and hopefully, in the next 20, 25 minutes, we\u2019ll be back up and running, and the ball will be thrown in and we\u2019re in for a great final.\u201d", "summary": "The game will now start at 4.30pm.", "url": "https://www.thejournal.ie/munster-hurling-final-2-2-6403425-Jun2024/", "image": "https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/6403425/river/?height=400&version=6403396", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:10:38", "author": "View All Articles", "authors": ["View All Articles"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.421}

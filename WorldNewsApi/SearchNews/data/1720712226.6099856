Izabelle Malmberg, 31, told Newsweek how a meat-heavy diet for her toddler has been beneficial.The American Academy of Pediatrics states a child should start eating solid foods around six months of age, and they should be introduced to a diverse diet that includes foods from various groups such as infant cereals, meats or other proteins, fruits, vegetables, grains, yogurts, and cheeses. However, the mother of soon-to-be three boys disagrees and her children, Noah, 5, and Taj, 2, have gone from milk to meat.Malmberg, who holds a degree in nutritional medicine, told Newsweek: \"I am not a fan of grains and I don't stress about vegetables, they are overrated in my opinion.\"A study conducted by David Klurfeld, USDA Agricultural Research Service, Beltsville, Maryland, discusses how red meat provides essential nutrients like complete proteins, bioavailable iron, zinc, selenium, and B vitamins, especially B12, which are often lacking in diets and can be supplied by consuming a few ounces of beef weekly.Historically linked to brain evolution, recent studies associate red and processed meats with chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and increased mortality. Critics emphasize these risks despite weak data.The Benefits of a Meat-Based Diet\"I am not saying that a child should be a carnivore for the rest of his or her life, we are talking about a very small period in a babies life,\" Malmberg told Newsweek.Taj was on a carnivore diet from 6-12 months of age before transitioning to a more ancestral way of eating, which includes some local seasonal plants.\"We eat a meat-heavy diet with some days purely carnivore, which I've maintained through most of my third pregnancy,\" she noted.\"As parents, we strive to provide our babies with the best possible start in life, and nutrition plays a crucial role in their growth and development.\"\"By offering animal foods first, you are promoting optimal nutrient absorption. As babies reach six months of age, their iron requirement goes up. The best way to support this is to offer natural, iron-rich foods such as red meat, eggs, meat stock, organs, and bone marrow,\" Malmberg said. \"The high bio-availability of nutrients in meat makes it an ideal choice for babies who are just beginning to explore solid foods.\"Malmberg asserts that a meat-based diet offers numerous benefits for babies, providing a rich source of essential nutrients that are vital for their growth and development. \"Unlike traditional approaches to starting solids, which often rely heavily on fortified grain-based cereals and pur\u00e9e, a meat-based diet offers a nutrient-dense alternative that is well-suited to the needs of growing infants,\" she explained.\"Things like rice cereal and grains, which are fortified with iron, are usually very hard to digest for babies and can cause inflammation in their gut. Rice is also contaminated with heavy metals and is overall a low-nutrient food which isn't suitable for babies. Many babies suffer from eczema and other issues when starting solids due to the heavy focus on plants, which often contain a lot of pesticides and herbicides. Their main nutrients needed at the 6-12 months phase are iron, zinc, and protein, so why not go to the best available source?\"Malmberg, who lives in Queensland, Australia, swears by it and frequently shares videos of her son Taj tucking into pieces of meat on her social media @themeatbasednutritionist. On May 25, a video of him eating a T-bone steak with his hands racked up over 17,000 views on Instagram.In the caption, she highlights 10 benefits of red meat, which include preventing anemia, supporting immune function, growth, muscle and brain development, and maintaining healthy hemoglobin levels. It also aids in cognitive skills and developing diverse eating habits.She also shared a video showing what Taj eats in a day\u2014typically consisting of eggs, pork rinds, beef mince or fish, and sometimes a smoothie made of raw cow's milk, a raw egg, beef liver powder, and fruit like a banana or homemade meat stock.Research supports some of Malmberg's claims. A study published in Current Developments in Nutrition surveyed over 2,000 adults who followed a carnivore diet and found that most reported high levels of satisfaction and perceived health benefits, including improvements in chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The study noted that while there are concerns about nutrient deficiencies and cardiovascular risks, participants reported few adverse effects and high satisfaction with their diet\u200b.What Did the Expert Say?However, not all experts agree. Allison Orr, a specialty dietician in clinical nutrition at Orlando Health Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children, encourages families to make \"healthy dietary changes\" and include all food groups.She said: \"Meats and animal products contain saturated fats and cholesterol which can lead to heart disease when consumed in excessive amounts. A diet lacking in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables is low in fiber and nutrients like vitamin C.\"Inadequate fiber intake can lead to bowel dysfunction and chronic constipation whereas diets rich in fiber have been associated with decreased risk of certain bowel diseases including diverticulosis and colorectal cancer.\"Orr advises parents to \"take caution\" when feeding a child with medical conditions that require a diet lower in protein, iron, or fat. These conditions may include kidney diseases, certain metabolic disorders, hemochromatosis, familial hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular diseases, and gastrointestinal disorders such as gallbladder disease, malabsorption, and gastroparesis.Malmberg added: \"Fiber is not an essential nutrient; in fact, we can't digest fiber. Babies who are exclusively breastfed poo almost daily, so we don't need fiber for bowel motions. Their gut microbiology comes from mom's milk, animal foods, and their immediate environment (they touch and lick everything). You can also use fermented dairy.\"Malmberg Shares Her First-Born's ExperienceMalmberg advocates for a carnivore diet for infants based on her expertise and personal experience. Despite criticism, positive outcomes and some research suggest significant benefits from a meat-heavy diet for infants. Parents should consult healthcare professionals to ensure nutritional needs are met.She explained: \"We chose to do carnivore to ensure baby got a strong taste for animal products since they are the most important. With Noah, we did a 'balanced' diet with, and he ended up drawn to sweet flavor and becoming picky, which is seen in most babies and toddlers due to the heavy push for carbs. Taj is still loving his fat and protein at two years of age.\"Is there a health issue that's worrying you? Let us know via health@newsweek.com.

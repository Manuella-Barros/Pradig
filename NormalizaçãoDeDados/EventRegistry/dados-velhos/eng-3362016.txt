Suspected white supremacist James Alex Fields Jr., 20, has been charged with second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count related to leaving the scene.\n\nIn a tweet over the weekend, UCP leadership candidate Doug Schweitzer accused The Rebel of \"defending Nazis\" in its coverage.\n\nJust before the fatal collision, Rebel personality Faith Goldy was livestreaming from the scene and condemning authorities for allowing counter protesters to rally, after they declared the white supremacist march an illegal gathering.\n\nGoldy was still live when the car crashed into the crowd where she stood.\n\nSchweitzer called on other UCP leadership candidates to distance themselves from the organization, which was founded by outspoken conservative commentator Ezra Levant.\n\n\"We heard the Rebel Media providing coverage on it and right before the individual was hit by that car and died, they were offering soft support to some white supremacist groups that were out there,\" Schweitzer said to CBC News on Monday.\n\nHe said Rebel has evolved from a site that offered a \"fresh voice for issues\" into a platform for the alt-right.\n\n\"It has no place in United Conservative Party, we cannot be playing footsie with this and enough is enough,\" he said. \"Conservative politicians should no longer be participating in a platform that allows for the facilitation of hate.\"\n\nLevant himself issued a memo on The Rebel website Monday distancing his organization from the neo-Nazis marching through Charlottesville.\n\nHe also distanced the organization from the alt-right label, saying it has evolved from \"unashamed right-wingedness, with a sense of humour\" to something driven by white nationalists focused on race.\n\n\"That term now effectively means racism, anti-Semitism and tolerance of neo-Nazism,\" he wrote.\n\nThe statement wasn't enough for Schweitzer.\n\n\"I think that condemning them is obviously a step that they're doing. They're trying to do damage control over their current actionsm,\" he said.\n\nLeadership hopeful Brian Jean tweeted on Saturday he agrees with Schweitzer that white supremacists have no place in society.\n\nWhite supremacists have no place in our society. I echo my colleague @doug_schweitzer in condemning what is happening in Charlottesville. --\n\n@BrianJeanAB\n\nAt a media availability on health policy on Monday, Jean -- whose campaign manager is a director for Rebel Media -- again denounced racism but did not explicitly condemn the right-wing outlet's coverage.\n\nIn an email, Jason Kenney's campaign team also denounced the attacks on the weekend, but did not condemn Rebel Media's reporting of them.\n\n\"Jason has been building bridges between Canadian communities of all races, ethnicities and religions for over a decade,\" Kenney spokesperson Blaise Boehmer said.\n\nJeff Callaway, the fourth candidate for the UCP leadership, has not responded to requests for an interview.\n\nPollster Janet Brown said Schweitzer is using the issue to set himself apart in the leadership race.\n\n\"He's definitely trying to make Rebel Media a wedge issue,\" she said.\n\n\"He's really trying to separate himself from the other candidates, as someone who hasn't been involved with Rebel Media and doesn't have anyone on his campaign involved.\"\n\nBrown said most Albertans identify as fiscally conservative, but are not comfortable with social conservatism.\n\n\"This really is the sort of weak link for the UCP, this is the quicksand they have to avoid,\" she said.\n\nBrown said it looks as though Jean and Kenney are trying to avoid the \"distraction of having a fight with Rebel Media\" by not condemning the organization.\n\n\"I don't know that Rebel Media is really all that important that their success would live and die on them being aligned with Rebel Media,\" she said.\n\nSchweitzer's tweet prompted a response from Goldy.\n\n\"Lawyer confused by concept of first amendment,\" she tweeted.\n\nThe coverage was also the final straw for Brian Lilley, listed as a co-founder on The Rebel website, who posted to Facebook on Monday that he could no longer be part of the organization because of its increasingly harsh tone on issues like immigration and Islam.\n\n\"There are ways to disagree on policy without resorting to us versus them rhetoric,\" he wrote.\n\n\"What The Rebel suffers from is a lack of editorial and behavioural judgment that left unchecked will destroy it and those around it.

He spoke with As It Happens guest host Mike Finnerty. Here is part of their conversation:\n\nWhat did you mean when you tweeted?\n\nWhen the Rebel Media first came out, it was a bit of a fresh voice on issues, but over the last while it slowly evolved into a platform that allows for the advocation of, you know, white supremacy, hate, neo-Nazis, and that simply isn't good enough.\n\nWe're seeing this in that alt-right media in the United States and we can't let that come to Canada.\n\nThat's a serious allegation against the Rebel Media. What exactly have they done that you think advances white supremacy?\n\nOn that tape [of Rebel reporter Faith Goldy's live Charlottesville coverage] they were offering kind of soft support to kind of the white movement, and you know, soft support to the white supremacists, until that tragic event where someone died.\n\nAnd when you look at that, along with other commentary and their participation in some of the events that are going on in the United States in particular, here in Canada we have to stand up and say: \"No. Not here. Not in Canada.\"\n\nAnd I'm tired of conservative politicians playing footsie with this organization\n\nWas this past weekend, was Charlottesville and their coverage, a turning point?\n\nI think that lines have been crossed for a while now, but this is simply an illustration of, why do we have to put up with these platforms?\n\nFree speech is one thing. I'm a big fan of free speech. But you don't have to give somebody a megaphone.\n\nYou did have, though, Jason Kenney and Brian Jean both tweeting out over the weekend ... What do you make of those tweets? Are they not enough?\n\nSo sad to see vile, racist spectacle in Virginia. Hatred has now turned to violence. Those responsible attack all that is best about America --\n\n@jkenney\n\nWhite supremacists have no place in our society. I echo my colleague @doug_schweitzer in condemning what is happening in Charlottesville. --\n\n@BrianJeanAB\n\nNo, I don't think that they are enough. It's one thing to condemn those events. Those are tragic events.\n\nThe main focus of my tweet, though, that I sent out over the weekend, was the fact that we can't allow these platforms that allow for the facilitation of hate to continue and be a part of it.\n\nThe alt-right has no room in our United Conservative Party here in Alberta.\n\nWhat is that going to mean? What, no one gives any interviews to the Rebel Media at all from now on?\n\nYes, that's exactly what I'm saying.\n\nThe Rebel Media was not given accreditation for the United Nations COP22 climate conference in Marrakech in November and it was the Canadian Association of Journalists who came to their defence.\n\nIf Canadian Association of Journalists is willing to step up and defend The Rebel, isn't there a point to letting them carry on and continue to do political coverage with access to you?\n\nNo. You know what? They've crossed a line here in the last while and it's evolved even since then. It's to the point now that you don't need to participate in an organization that facilitates this. It's creating this toxic environment in our society.\n\nWhen I was younger I didn't think that I'd have to come on and deal with racism and deal with this in my generation. But enough is enough.\n\nPeople who are staunch defenders of the Rebel Media, are they welcome within the United Conservatives?\n\nIf people want to advocate for hate or people want to advocate for divisive issues, you know what? There may be a different home for them.\n\nYou have been accused in some quarters of trying to take advantage of this weekend's news in Charlottesville. Is that fair?\n\nNo, this is just simply a proof point. When people are paying attention to what's happening and the type of coverage that the Rebel Media is providing to these organizations. It's simply not good enough.

But the shock waves from the neo-Nazi rallies that overwhelmed Charlottesville this weekend echo here. It was telling how quickly the leadership candidates for the United Conservative Party responded to the murder and mayhem by the American \"alt-right\" hate-mongers.\n\nDoug Schweitzer, the Calgary lawyer who's trying to position himself as the moderate candidate in the leadership fight was first to take to Twitter to denounce the Charlottesville riot -- and to call out Rebel Media for its initial fawning coverage of the white supremacist marchers.\n\n\"Charlottesville is a reminder of the need to fight extremism and alt-right politics,\" Schweitzer stated. \"We can't let this come to Alberta and Canada.\"\n\n#Charlottesville is a reminder of the need to fight extremism and alt right politics. We can't let this come to AB and Canada. #ableg #ucp https://t.co/2mgmY1ghII\n\n-- Doug Schweitzer (@doug_schweitzer) August 12, 2017\n\n\"The Rebel TV is defending Nazis,\" Schweitzer continued. \"This is just wrong ... Enough is enough. We have to be better than this in Canada. Stand up to them for a change. We all need to lead by example.\"\n\nHe was followed a few minutes later by fellow UCP leadership candidate and former Wildrose leader Brian Jean, who offered a one-tweet statement.\n\n\"White supremacists have no place in our society. I echo my colleague Doug Schweitzer in condemning what is happening in Charlottesville.\"\n\nWhite supremacists have no place in our society. I echo my colleague @doug_schweitzer in condemning what is happening in Charlottesville.\n\n-- Brian Jean (@BrianJeanAB) August 12, 2017\n\nIt took a good three hours longer for Jason Kenney to post his own fiery statement.\n\n\"So sad to see vile, racist spectacle in Virginia,\" Kenney stated. \"Hatred has now turned to violence. Those responsible attack all that is best about America.\"\n\nKenney then spent the next two days tweeting out a dizzying array of pictures taken with Filipino, Punjabi, Chinese, Tsuu T'ina and Pakistani supporters.\n\nSo sad to see vile, racist spectacle in Virginia. Hatred has now turned to violence. Those responsible attack all that is best about America\n\n-- Jason Kenney (@jkenney) August 12, 2017\n\n(Jeff Callaway, the fourth candidate in the UCP leadership race, didn't tweet anything himself about Charlottesville, although he did retweet Arizona Sen. John McCain's statement.)\n\nThe UCP leadership contenders know that they and their party have a delicate problem. They're not neo-Nazis. They certainly don't want mainstream Albertans to think their party welcomes neo-Nazis. But the new party has been playing footsie with those on the far right since before it was born, courting precisely the sorts of extremists who post the vilest and most hateful of comments about Alberta's female premier and female cabinet ministers.\n\nIt's far subtler dog-whistle politics than U.S. President Donald Trump's overt appeals to racism and fascism. It's far more polite. You see it, for example, when UPC MLAs brand themselves \"ordinary Albertans\" and \"normal Albertans\" -- quietly differentiating themselves from Albertans who might not have \"ordinary\" skin tones, or \"ordinary\" religious beliefs, or \"normal\" sexual identities. It's code. But it's not hard to break.\n\nThe problem with dog whistles, though, is that they summon dogs. Dogs who many turn out to be fierce and unpredictable. Charlottesville shows us exactly the forces of evil that Trump has already summoned and unleashed. Now that we see literal Nazis, with lit torches, shouting overtly Nazi slogans, marching through American streets, it's small wonder conservatives here are watching the images from Virginia with dismay, wondering how they can distance themselves from the alt-right.\n\n(Amazingly, even Ezra Levant, the incorrigible editor of far-right Rebel, has suddenly realized that Nazis gonna Nazi. He spent Monday turning semantic cartwheels in a frantic effort to divorce himself from the very people his own website has spent months lionizing. We have reached peak irony, surely, when Levant is denouncing Charlottesville's white supremacists more forcefully than did the U.S. president.)\n\nBut wringing our hands about Virginia isn't enough. We already know, here, that these guys are lethal. Just ask the Edmonton Police Service, whose hate-crimes investigator Daniel Woodall was murdered by a racist, anti-Semitic, misogynist, homophobic Freeman-on-the-Land, two weeks before Trump announced his candidacy.\n\nSince Trump, things have only escalated, with groups like the III% militia arming themselves, with organizations like the Worldwide Coalition Against Islam Canada and the Soldiers of Odin staging public hate rallies across Alberta. Yes, they've all been emboldened by Trump's validation.\n\nIt's not enough for conservative leaders here to denounce the Charlottesville Nazis. It's their responsibility to call out their own fringe supporters and to stop playing nudge-nudge-wink-wink games with Alberta's alt-right. And whoever does become leader will need to join Premier Rachel Notley's government in ensuring Alberta's police forces, municipal and RCMP, have the resources they need to track and defuse far-right violence.\n\nThe arc of history may bend towards justice, but only if every generation joins the fight against racism & demagoguery. #Charlottesville\n\n-- Rachel Notley (@RachelNotley) August 13, 2017\n\nAs Notley herself tweeted this weekend, \"The arc of history may bend towards justice, but only if every generation joins the fight against racism and demagoguery.\"\n\nThis is a fight that Albertans of goodwill, across party lines, must wage together. Let Charlottesville's wake-up call be our own. Fan the flames of hate -- and the world starts to burn.\n\nRelated\n\npsimons@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/Paulatics\n\nwww.facebook.com/PaulaSimons", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"freq": 3,

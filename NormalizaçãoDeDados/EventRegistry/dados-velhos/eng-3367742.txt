Then there are other occasions, like his last two times out, in which the right-hander has struggled.\n\nAgainst the New York Mets on Friday, Pivetta pitched 4 2/3 innings and allowed six runs (five earned) and seven hits. Versus the Colorado Rockies on Aug. 5, he worked 2 2/3 innings and was blistered for eight runs on eight hits.\n\nPivetta was unable to place the ball where he wanted, and that is his biggest issue, Mackanin said. Not that he is walking a ton of people -- three free passes in the two games combined -- but his aim is just a tad off.\n\n\"It's as simple as he is not commanding his pitches,\" Mackanin said. \"He has a real nice fastball with good life, but he is just not hitting his spots. That is step one to learn how to locate that pitch. If you command that pitch, it sets everything else up.\"\n\nThat leads back to Pivetta's recent bullpen session with pitching coach Bob McClure.\n\n\"I think McClure might take one of his breaking balls away from him,\" Mackanin said. \"We like his curveball; we might take his slider away from him. But it is not etched in stone, and I don't know if that is exactly what we are going to do, but it has been talked about.\"\n\nThere is no way to talk about the Phillies' offense without bringing up Odubel Herrera. The center fielder extended his career-high, 17-game hitting streak in the series opener Monday, but he tweaked his left hamstring in that game and didn't play Tuesday.\n\nHe is unlikely to start Wednesday when the Phillies face left-hander Clayton Richard (5-12, 5.14 ERA).\n\n\"I want to be careful with him,\" Mackanin said.\n\nRichard has lost his past five decisions and is coming off consecutive no-decisions. He has never defeated the Phillies, going 0-4 with a 3.41 ERA in eight appearances, including four starts. In his lone start against Philadelphia this year, he allowed one run on five hits in six innings but did not get a decision on July 7.\n\nRichard went six innings against the Los Angeles Dodgers in his last outing, yielding three runs on eight hits Friday. It was a back-and-forth game in which the Padres prevailed 4-3.\n\n\"These games are the fun ones, where it's close, it's back-and-forth,\" Richard said after the game. \"They test you a little bit, make sure you're resilient through adversity.\"\n\nRichard knows all about resilience, last finding the winner's circle on June 13 against the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nPivetta did show well against the Padres in his only career outing against them, when he opposed Richard on July 7. He went seven innings and was charged with three runs on five hits. He didn't walk a batter and struck out nine in the Phillies' 4-3 loss, with neither starter involved in the decision.\n\n\"I think he has a chance to be pretty good because he has such a lively

Phillies manager Pete Mackanin thought Pivetta could have a Kerry Wood-type day, referring to Wood's memorable 20-strikeout shutout in 1998. Padres pitcher Clayton Richard asked Cameron Rupp in the bottom of the third inning if Pivetta really had struck out everybody he had faced.\n\n\"He got to two strikes and kill shot -- immediately,\" Rupp said.\n\nPivetta struck out a career-high 11 batters, but he also allowed five hits, three runs, three walks and played a role in five stolen bases in five-plus innings. The Phillies optioned him to Triple-A Lehigh Valley afterward.\n\n\"It will be fine,\" Pivetta said. \"I'm going to be back up eventually.\"\n\nIt is a procedural move more than anything. Pivetta got optioned because the Phillies are shorthanded in the outfield with Odubel Herrera nursing a sore left hamstring. Herrera could play sometime this weekend in San Francisco, but the Phillies will add a position player Thursday to give them help on the bench. Optioned players need to spend 10 days in the Minor Leagues, but the Phillies play a doubleheader Tuesday against the Marlins at Citizens Bank Park. Pivetta can be added to the roster as the team's 26th man and start one of those games, which seems likely. He can rejoin the team permanently on Aug. 27.\n\nThe Phillies have two healthy position players on the 40-man roster not in the Majors: Brock Stassi and Dylan Cozens. One of them could be promoted. Or they could make a 40-man roster transaction and promote Pedro Florimon, who can play the infield and outfield.\n\nMackanin made it clear that Pivetta was not optioned because of his performance.\n\n\"He pitched well today,\" he said. \"I like what he did, other than the stolen bases. I thought he was really good.\"\n\nWednesday was the first time the Phillies allowed five stolen bases in a game since May 30, 2013, when Boston's Jacoby Ellsbury stole five against Jonathan Pettibone (twice), Jeremy Horst (twice) and Mike Stutes. Two of the stolen bases Wednesday came on a botched double steal in the fourth, which allowed Wil Myers to steal second, third and home in the same inning.\n\n\"I wasn't mixing my holds I guess enough,\" said Pivetta, who failed to look back the runner at least twice. \"Something I need to work on. Something I can learn from.\"\n\nBut in the end Pivetta struck out eight batters on breaking balls. He credited a new slider grip, which pitching coach Bob McClure showed him, for some of the success.\n\n\"He threw a lot of good secondary stuff for strikes, which is one of the goals we're working on for him,\" Mackanin said. \"He carried it for a while. He needs to understand how to continue to carry that through five, six, seven or even eight innings. That's when you get to be a real solid starter. He's a young pitcher. It's his first year in the big leagues. He's going to get it. He's going to be good.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T01:57:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1379, "textStart": 1372, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-27", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 1940, "textStart":

His left hamstring bothered him Monday and Tuesday. But it is not bad enough -- yet -- to require time on the disabled list.\n\n\"Better,\" Herrera said when asked about the injury.\n\nCould he play this weekend?\n\n\"Maybe,\" Herrera said.\n\nSo that is why the Phillies demoted their starter from Wednesday's game, Nick Pivetta, to triple A. They will summon an extra position player for Thursday's game in San Francisco. The demotion is not punitive for Pivetta.\n\n[Phillies blanked by Clayton Richard and his 5.14 ERA]\n\nReally, it is a procedural transaction.\n\nPivetta is not scheduled to start again until Tuesday, when the Phillies play a doubleheader at Citizens Bank Park against Miami. Recent rules changes to the collective bargaining agreement permit teams to add a 26th man for scheduled doubleheaders. Pivetta, despite not being on his optional assignment for 10 days, can be that 26th man and start one of the games.\n\nThe Phillies would not confirm that is their plan.\n\n\"He's an option for that,\" Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said. \"That's the new rule; you can add a 26th man. He's a possibility.\"\n\nThe Phillies have a full 40-man roster and just two healthy position players on it who are not in the majors. They are Dylan Cozens and Brock Stassi. Cozens has hit .179 with 64 strikeouts in 134 at-bats since July 1. So Stassi could be the choice as a temporary addition.\n\nPivetta understood the situation. He must report to triple-A Lehigh Valley, but he probably will not pitch there.\n\n\"I'm going to go down and work hard,\" Pivetta said. \"It will be fine. I'm going to be back up eventually. So we'll just keep moving day by day there.\"\n\nHerrera's status, for the second straight day, remained unclear.\n\n\"That's still up in the air,\" Mackanin said. \"I don't have a definite answer for that. In the meantime, we need a position player.\"\n\nExtra bases\n\nSan Diego swept the Phillies for the first time ever at Petco Park, which opened in 2004. Their last three-game sweep of the Phillies here was in 2000, when the games were played at Qualcomm Stadium. ... The Phillies will face three lefties in their four games at AT&T Park. First, on Thursday, is veteran righthander Jeff Samardzija. Then the Giants will go with Matt Moore, Ty Blach and Madison Bumgarner. The Phillies will counter with four righthanders starting with Aaron Nola on Thursday. After that, it's Zach Eflin, Jerad Eickhoff and Mark Leiter Jr.\n\nRead more by Matt Gelb Published: August 16, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 3:01 AM EDT | Updated: August 16, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 7:41 PM EDT\n\nThanks for your continued support...\n\nWe recently asked you to support our journalism.

The Phillies rookie struck out eight of the first 10 batters he faced Wednesday afternoon. No Padres hitter put a ball in play until Manuel Margot flied out to center for the third out in the third inning.\n\nAnd, still, Pivetta could not record an out in the sixth inning of a 3-0 loss.\n\nThe Phillies were swept by one of the few teams in baseball that owns a worse run differential than them. It was a good three days for draft-pick positioning, less so for sanity. Pivetta was sent down to triple-A Lehigh Valley after the game. Clayton Richard, one of the worst pitchers in baseball, fired a shutout. He had allowed 188 hits in 24 starts before Wednesday. The Phillies mustered three hits against him. The lineup is muted without its two most productive hitters, Odubel Herrera and Aaron Altherr.\n\nRichard, who turns 34 next month, registered his first shutout since 2012. He had a 5.14 ERA before Wednesday.\n\nSo. There are 45 more games to play.\n\nPivetta achieved a new high with 11 strikeouts. But, once a Padres hitter reached base, chaos unfolded. San Diego took seven extra bases with Pivetta on the mound. Five were on stolen bases. One was on a balk. Another came on a passed ball by Cameron Rupp.\n\nCarlos Asuaje started the fourth with a hustle double to center. Wil Myers, with two outs, singled to left. Asuaje scored. Then Myers assumed control of the game.\n\nPivetta did not peek at Myers, while he was on first. Myers, with a great jump, swiped second base. Pivetta paid no attention to him there. So he stole third. Austin Hedges walked. He attempted to steal second, and Cameron Rupp threw there. He could have held the ball. Hedges drew a rundown, which allowed Myers to dash for home. He stole that, too. Cesar Hernandez fired wide to the plate. The entire play warranted a face-palm.\n\nThe Phillies have asked their young pitchers to manage the opposition's running game, but they have found it to be a difficult task when added to the challenges of mere pitching.\n\nIt's not as if opponents have run wild on the Phillies; with the five successful steal attempts Wednesday, teams have stolen at a 73.6 percent clip against them. That is right near the league average. Seventeen teams, entering the day, had permitted more stolen bases than the Phillies.\n\nPivetta, before Wednesday, had been on the mound for two stolen bases. He throws hard, and he throws his fastball often. That is not an ideal recipe for running. But the Padres timed Pivetta and exploited a weakness.\n\nHe discovered something with his breaking balls early in the game. Eight of his 11 strikeouts came on breaking pitches. But, when he handed the ball to Pete Mackanin with no outs in the sixth inning, it was unsatisfying.\n\nRead more by Matt Gelb Published: August 16, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 3:01 AM EDT | Updated: August 16, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 6:30 PM EDT\n\nThanks for your continued support...\n\nWe recently asked you to support our journalism.

The Padres completed the sweep with a 3-0 win on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nPadres starter Clayton Richard entered the game leading the majors in hits allowed (188), opponents' batting average (.323) and opponents' on-base percentage (.376), and yet the Phillies were shut out on three hits by the veteran lefty.\n\nThe Phillies were outscored 18-8 in the series. They went 1-5 against the Padres this season.\n\nThe Phillies have the worst record in the majors at 43-75. They are on pace for 103 losses. They are 19-44 on the road.\n\nStarting pitching report\n\nRookie Nick Pivetta had one of those games where his potential shined, but so did his inexperience and inconsistency.\n\nHe came out of the gate throwing a bunch of curveballs and had good success with the pitch. Eight of his first nine outs were strikeouts and all but one of them ended with a curveball. He ended up with a career-high 11 strikeouts, but failed to get an out in the sixth inning. In all, he allowed five hits and three runs in his five innings of work. He walked three, committed a balk and was on the mound for five stolen bases (see story).\n\nFollowing the game's final out, Pivetta was optioned to Triple A Lehigh Valley. He is likely to return to pitch in Tuesday's doubleheader against Miami. The Phils will use Pivetta's roster spot to add a position player while Odubel Herrera recuperates from a hamstring issue.\n\nRichard walked one and struck out six in his first shutout since 2012. He is 6-12.\n\nBullpen report\n\nEdubray Ramos and Adam Morgan cleaned it up for the Phillies.\n\nNo bullpen necessary for the Padres.\n\nAt the plate\n\nThe Phillies had a runner on second base three times and never advanced from there.\n\nWil Myers got the Padres on the board with an RBI single against Pivetta with two outs in the fourth. It drove home Carlos Asuaje, who had led off the frame with a double. Myers swiped home on a double steal for the Padres' second run in that inning. Hunter Renfroe's RBI single in the sixth made it a 3-0 game.\n\nThe Padres had just seven hits.\n\nHealth check\n\nHerrera did not play for a second straight day because of a sore left hamstring. Manager Pete Mackanin hopes to have Herrera in San Francisco (see story).\n\nUp next\n\nThe Phillies move on to San Francisco for a four-game series beginning on Thursday night.

That bumped Mark Leiter Jr. to the bullpen, although he may not be there long because Zach Eflin's right shoulder is bothering him. Vince Velasquez, on the disabled list, went home and is scheduled next week to meet a vascular specialist in St. Louis. Nick Pivetta is with triple-A Lehigh Valley, but that is just a temporary residence.\n\nThe Phillies do not know much about their 2018 rotation. Their knowledge is limited to this: Aaron Nola will be in it.\n\nBeyond that, there are questions -- as the current jumble indicates. The Phillies, in each of the last two winters, have buttressed the rotation with two veteran arms. It would not be a shock to see them pursue more veterans on one-year deals this winter.\n\nThey have witnessed productive flashes from each of their young starters. But it has not been consistent.\n\n\"We're still looking for guys to get it together,\" Pete Mackanin said.\n\nThe Phillies manager declined to comment when asked if he would like to see the front office add a few veteran arms for next season. The Phillies have money to spend. They would like to spend it, for now, on short-term commitments. That means they'll be in the market for pitchers like Jason Vargas, Trevor Cahill, and Chris Tillman -- but not the top options in Yu Darvish or Jake Arrieta.\n\nThe free-agent market for starting pitchers is not great. The best ones are locked up before they reach free agency. The ones who do are on the wrong side of 30 and considered risks if signed to a contract longer than one or two years. So the Phillies will look for potential trade candidates; that is how they acquired Jeremy Hellickson, Charlie Morton and Clay Buchholz. The returns on those investments were mixed.\n\nThe organization's best pitching prospects are in A ball. Two who have to be added to the 40-man roster this winter, Franklyn Kilome and Ranger Suarez, could begin next season at double A. Drew Anderson has had a decent season at Reading. Elniery Garca, also at Reading, is an unknown as he returns from a shoulder injury and drug suspension.\n\nThe Phillies have used 10 different starters this season. Some, like Eflin, have regressed. Eflin, after allowing six runs in five innings Friday, said Saturday his shoulder was \"doing better.\" He will be examined again Sunday. But he may not make his next start.\n\nThere is some concern for Velasquez's injured right middle finger. The pitcher will see Robert Thompson, a surgeon who is considered one of the foremost experts on thoracic outlet syndrome, a nerve-irritation disorder that has affected a handful of pitchers in recent years. Velasquez's status is unclear. He has pitched just 72 innings this season.\n\nPivetta and Lively employ opposite styles in their pitching. Both have enjoyed some success, but it has been outweighed by failures. Jerad Eickhoff has not resembled the pitcher he was a season ago. Still, he is in the plans for next season.\n\nLeiter, the Phillies decided, has more value to them in the bullpen. His stuff has played better there. Mackanin sees Leiter as a prototypical long man. So, instead, Lively has a chance every fifth day.\n\n\"This year is another year devoted to find out who is going to be in our future,\" Mackanin said.\n\nThere is not much else for the manager to declare. That process, so far, has not yielded the sort of results the Phillies hoped to see.\n\nExtra bases\n\nJorge Alfaro started at first base Saturday. He had not played there in the minors this season, but he has more than 50 games of experience at the position. \"So I'm going to give it a shot,\" Mackanin said. \"It keeps his bat in the lineup.\" Alfaro could catch Lively in Sunday's series finale. ... The Phillies are 6-22 against the National League West this season. ... Lively will be opposed by Madison Bumgarner, who has a 3.60 ERA against the Phillies in nine career starts.\n\nRead more by Matt Gelb Published: August 19, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 3:01 AM EDT | Updated: August 19, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 10:26 PM EDT\n\nThanks for your continued support...\n\nWe recently asked you to support our journalism.

The defeat was the Phillies' 10th in 14 games, further distancing them from the Giants (48-74) in the duel for last place in the National League.\n\nThe Phillies won two of three when the clubs met in Philadelphia in June. Neither Nola nor Samardzija pitched in that series.\n\nThe No. 7 overall pick of the 2014 draft, Nola (9-7, 3.02 ERA) has faced the Giants just once in his career, and it did not go well. He was bombed for five runs and 10 hits in 3 1/3 innings, yet got no decision, at AT&T Park last season.\n\nNola has allowed just 13 earned runs in his past 10 starts, a stretch during which he limited all 10 opponents to two earned runs or fewer.\n\nHe has been even better since the All-Star break, accumulating the NL's third-best ERA (1.85) in six starts.\n\nNola will duel new Giants third baseman Pablo Sandoval for the first time.\n\nWaived by the Boston Red Sox in July, signed to a minor league deal by the Giants three days later and promoted to the majors earlier this month, Sandoval has hits in eight of his 10 games in his return to the team that he helped win 2010, 2012 and 2014 World Series championships.\n\nHe was the only Giant to play in all six games on their just completed trip.\n\n\"With Buster (Posey) out, I wanted to keep him in the lineup,\" Giants manager Bruce Bochy said about Sandoval's start Wednesday at Miami. \"His thing is, 'Hey, I've had enough days off this year.'\"\n\nSandoval went 1-for-3 with a walk in San Francisco's 8-1 loss to the Marlins.\n\nSamardzija (7-12, 4.74 ERA) will take the mound Thursday on a nice roll, but with no history of success against the Phillies.\n\nHe opened the Giants' 2-4 trip with a 3-1 loss at Washington, which ended his personal three-game winning streak. He has compiled a 3.29 ERA in those four games.\n\nSamardzija has never gone head-to-head with a current member of the Phillies. He has a 1-4 record and a 8.67 ERA in 10 games, including four starts, in his career against Philadelphia.\n\nLike Nola, Samardzija should expect to see an unfamiliar opponent on Thursday night. The Phillies demoted their Wednesday starting pitcher, Nick Pivetta, to Triple-A Lehigh Valley after the loss in San Diego, seeking to create a roster spot for an outfielder for the series against the Giants.\n\nThe Phillies are expected to make the promotion announcement before the Thursday game.\n\nOutfield help is needed with Odubel Herrera sidelined due to a hamstring injury.\n\n\"I don't have a definite answer for that,\" manager Pete Mackanin responded when asked if Herrera, who sat out the Phillies' past two games, might be ready by the weekend. \"In the meantime, we need a position player.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T03:36:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5843137502670288, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367742", "time": "03:36:00", "lang":

The transaction is retroactive to Tuesday.\n\nThe Phillies have not announced a corresponding move.\n\nHerrera, who has a 17-game hitting streak, is hitting .343 with 24 doubles, three triples, nine home runs, 32 RBIs and a .967 OPS since June 1.

It is tied with Giancarlo Stanton and Charlie Blackmon for the best mark in baseball.\n\nIt is unclear if the Phillies will call up a pitcher or hitter. They demoted right-hander Nick Pivetta on Wednesday and promoted utility player Pedro Florimon on Thursday, so they actually have a full bench.\n\nIf Roman Quinn were healthy, he almost certainly would have been promoted, but Quinn remains sidelined with an injury to the ulnar collateral ligament in his left elbow in May.

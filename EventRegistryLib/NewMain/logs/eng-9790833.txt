Voice actor Natasha Chandel is involved in Project White Sands at Valve; speculation points to Half-Life 3 . Valve's recent game releases suggest a return to game development, sparking hope for Half-Life 3 's eventual release.\n\nHalf-Life 3, the never-made game that can't be forgotten, is back on everyone's radar after a leak suggested that Valve is officially developing the project. Having become one of the longest-running memes on the internet, the Half-Life fandom is unable to shake rumors that Gordon Freeman and his crowbar are on the verge of a major comeback given that whisperings of a third installment have swirled since the release of Half-Life 2: Episode 2 in 2007. There's still little in the way of confirmation, but the most recent leak is the closest thing to an official update in some years.\n\nPer a Reddit post by KekanKok, voice actor Natasha Chandel posted on her website that she's involved in something going by the codename Project White Sands which is in development at Valve; Chandel's website is no longer accessible at the time of writing.\n\nThe studio is notably already working on a hero shooter named Deadlock, driving speculation that Chandel is referring to something else. Half-Life 3 is currently the favored speculation given that White Sands is the name of both a national park and a military testing range in New Mexico, the state that housed Black Mesa's main base of operations.\n\nRelated\n\nWill Half-Life 3 Be In VR Like Alyx?\n\nHalf-Life: Alyx changed what gamers have come to expect out of VR games, but does Valve's release mean that Half-Life 3 will also be a VR exclusive?\n\nCould This Really Be Half-Life 3?\n\nNever Give Up Hope\n\nClose\n\nHalf-Life 3 may widely be considered an impossibility at this point but it's worth noting that Valve has actively been making an effort to return to game development. Aside from the aforementioned Deadlock, which is currently the studio's worst-kept secret after several substantial leaks, Valve recently released Counter-Strike 2, a revamped version of its hit competitive shooter. While it wasn't a vast departure from Counter-Strike, enough changes were made to warrant a separate release that impressed the entire community.\n\nHaving said that, while many may jump to the conclusion that Half-Life 3 is happening thanks to the vague reference to Nex Mexico, it's entirely possible that Project White Sands could take the form of something closer to Half-Life: Alyx. The VR-exclusive game, which is revered as one of the best experiences of its kind, didn't serve as a third mainline entry in the franchise. Rather, it was a prequel that didn't provide any answers to Half-Life 2: Episode 2's cliffhanger ending.\n\nWhether or not Project White Sands does turn out to be Half-Life 3, it's difficult to imagine the threequel living up to nearly two decades of hype. Valve has repeatedly stated that it's reluctant to simply developHalf-Life games to make quarterly numbers, insisting that it needs a good reason to return to the franchise. Perhaps the success of Alyx and Counter-Strikes is the sign it's been looking for.\n\nSource: KekanKok/Reddit\n\nHalf-Life 3\n\nSystems\n\nFranchise Half-Life\n\nPlatform(s) PC\n\nDeveloper(s) Valve\n\nPublisher(s) Valve", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brad_lang@screenrant.com", "name": "Brad Lang", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Half-Life (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Valve Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fandom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_shooter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hero shooter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Alyx", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Half-Life: Alyx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mesa_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Mesa (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Half-Life 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Counter-Strike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliffhanger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cliffhanger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platform game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality/Multi-User_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality/Multi-User Systems", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Cellular_Automata", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Cellular Automata", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/untitled-design-34-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790833", "eventUri": "eng-9790833", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-05-03", "textStart": 1816, "textEnd": 1821}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 231, "relevance": 1}

It's been 20 years since the launch of Half-Life 2. The episodes kept the story going, and Half-Life Alyx flipped the whole world on its head, but in terms of playing a new mainline entry in the epochal FPS series, it's been two decades. What's next for Gordon Freeman? What's going on with the Borealis? Who is G-Man? We still have no idea. But Half-Life 3, despite its now mythical status, might actually be alive after all. There are recent rumblings about Valve's ostensibly upcoming shooter Deadlock. Now, a leak from an actor's CV suggests - possibly, maybe, hopefully - something new from the Half-Life world.\n\nWhatever happened to Half-Life 3? It's not like Valve has been idle. Between Half-Life Alyx, Steam Deck, Counter-Strike 2, and now Deadlock, an announcement for which was also hinted recently, the developer and Steam owner has had plenty to do in the last few years. But the FPS game sequel likely remains top of most Valve fans' wishlists. Half-Life 2, or at least, the extended HL2 saga, ends on one heck of a cliffhanger - there's still so much we don't know. If Half-Life 3 ever does arrive, the expectations are going to be enormous. A new leak might be a clue that the white whale of shooter sequels is actually in the works.\n\nNatasha Chandel is a prolific actor and performer whose credits include Starfield, Valorant, Fallout 76, and Call of Duty. Their online portfolio references a 'Project White Sands.' Their specific role isn't mentioned, but Chandel lists Project White Sands as a Valve production. After the credit was spotted by Valve fans, Chandel's site seems to have been updated and mention of Project White Sands has been removed.\n\nSo, how does this link to Half-Life? White Sands is a national park and missile range in the state of New Mexico. Black Mesa, Gordon Freeman's former employer and the underground lab from the first Half-Life is located in the New Mexico desert. On first impression, that seems like a pretty direct hint at a new Half-Life game. On the contrary, if this is meant to be secret, it would be counterintuitive to make such an overt reference.\n\nMaybe the fact that this is so patently a nod to Half-Life means that Project White Sands isn't connected to the series at all. Or maybe it's the other way around. Or maybe it's all just nothing. It's been 20 years.

Valve sure loves to tease us with games we'll (likely) never see, and while we've largely given up on the idea of Portal 3, there's still a glimmer of hope that Half-Life 3 is coming. A mere 17 years after Half-Life 2: Episode Two was released, are we finally getting a proper sequel?\n\nAlthough the planned Episode 3 fell into the abyss alongside Borealis and the 2013 Half-Life 3, we memorably had the VR-only Half-Life: Alyx in 2020. Alyx didn't quite scratch that Half-Life itch, and even all these years later, we still hold a candle for a proper third game.\n\nThings came to a head when voice actor Natasha Chandel referenced a mysterious \"Project White Sands\" video game on her website. Although she didn't reveal what character she was voicing, it clearly stated this was a game for Valve. Throwing fuel on the fire, she's since removed all references to White Sands from her site.\n\nElsewhere, Tyler McVicker (formerly of Valve News Network) has posted a video speculating that White Sands in Half-Life 3. McVicker has collated all the recent datamine info, postulating that a project codenamed HLX is Half-Life 3, potentially being in development for the past three years.\n\nOthers have noted that White Sands is a park in New Mexico, which just happens to be where Black Mesa is. McVicker adds that HLX is a non-VR single-player game with the MVP inside a HEV suit. If that doesn't sound like the return of Gordon Freeman, nothing does.\n\nFor once, gamers seem sold on the idea - mainly because there's actual evidence instead of a simple rumour. Although one cheered, \"If we somehow get Half-Life 3 leaks before GTA 6 we will truly live in the strangest timeline,\" a sceptic added, \"I'll believe anything HL3 when I see it released and in hand at this point.\"\n\nStill, even if HLX and White Sands are the same thing, it doesn't mean it's Half-life 3. We previously speculated that HLX could be a follow-up to Alyx, and after all, Valve seemingly has an aversion to the number three.

You can see why fans have quickly jumped to believing that this is the fabled Half-Life 3, though honestly, I doubt that it will specifically be Half-Life 3.\n\nEarlier this year, Counter-Strike 2 was found to be containing files related to a project called Citadel, which looked to be some kind of multiplayer game. That project is clearly the still not officially revealed Deadlock, an upcoming hero shooter from Valve. But also found in these files was a reference to something called \"HLX.\"\n\nThis one's a little less clear, though seems to be pointing towards something Half-Life related. It could always be to do with Half-Life Alyx, given the X, but it really isn't clear right now. Any which way, it does seem like something Half-Life in the works, but I'd suggest you refrain from getting your hopes up.", "source": {"uri": "vg247.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VG247"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Half-Life (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfield_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starfield (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valorant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valorant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_76", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 76"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valve Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mesa_Research_Facility", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black Mesa Research Facility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_shooter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hero shooter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multiplayer video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Counter-Strike"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/half-life_LLHPRfP_jkY34o9.jpg?width=1200&height=600&fit=crop&enable=upscale&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790833", "eventUri": "eng-9790833", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

Alongside a supposed leak from a voice actor, it's the best evidence in years that we could eventually return to the Half-Life universe.\n\nContent creator and dataminer Tyler McVicker detailed his findings in a YouTube video on Aug. 4, showcasing numerous files from recent CS2 and Dota updates that reference terms last seen in Half-Life 2 and Half-Life: Alyx. Some of these terms, McVicker explains, didn't make the cut for the release of the Half-Life VR title but uncovered data confirms Valve has continued to test these features on the Source 2 engine.\n\nThe data all stems from a project titled \"HLX,\" which McVicker said wasn't speculated to be a new game but more like a new line of features or a file format for the Valve engine, but further digging revealed there was more to the puzzle -- and it all wasn't related to Deadlock, Valve's yet-to-be-announced MOBA hero shooter.\n\n\"For a while, a lot of these new features were being attributed to [Deadlock]\" McVicker said, but many of these Half-Life mentions are absent from early builds of the shooter.\n\nAdding fuel to the fires of speculation was a discovery made by a member of a gaming leaks subreddit with a link to voice actor Natasha Chandel's main website. Chandel's resume included a line for \"Project White Sands,\" a game without a release date created by Valve.

However, this time they are a lot more credible.\n\nAs first spotted on Reddit's r/GamingLeaksAndRumours subreddit, a voice actress named Natasha Chandel has a mysterious Valve project on her online resume. Chandel has several video game credits to her name, including Starfield and Call of Duty: Vanguard, among others which can be found on her official IMDb page. In other words, this isn't some made-up person.\n\nThe resume, which is still accessible via her official website, lists a project titled: Project White Sands. It's listed as a video game with a TBA release date. And its developer is Valve.\n\nThe website, which is largely inaccessible on a mobile device and partly obstructed on desktop, clearly lists the projects she has been part of, the part she played and the company responsible for them. Many of those projects can then be verified online, like her role in Starfield.\n\nNow that we set the stage for how this rumor came to be, it's important to highlight how this all connects to Half-Life. The project is titled White Sands. White Sands happens to be an actual place in New Mexico, with a National Park to boot.\n\nYou know what else is in New Mexico? That's right, Black Mesa. The same setting of where the game got its start. Do you see where we're going with this?\n\nNow, of course, this could be a nothingburger and Half-Life 3 never finally materializes.

But even after the release of Half-Life: Alyx in 2020 it's never really looked like it was going to happen.\n\nThe last rumour was exactly this time last year, ahead of the Gamescom event at the end of August, but, as usual, that turned out to be nothing. This time though there seems to be more reason for hope, especially as the rumour relates to something Valve is making with the codename White Sands.\n\nIt started, as rumours often do, with the CV of a voice actor, who lists 'Project White Sands (video game)' as a project she worked on with Valve. A codename which fans have already connected with a different one, datamined from Valve games over three years ago.\n\nThere's no more information from the voice actor but rather than the codename being just a random word White Sands is a place in New Mexico, which sounds an awful lot like the inverse of Black Mesa - where the original Half-Life was set.\n\nOf course, it could quite easily be a sequel to Half-Life: Alyx, which was teased by the game itself, or some other kind of spin-off.\n\nIt's also a little surprising to find Valve working on anything other than hero shooter Deadlock at the moment, given how un-prolific they've been over the last couple of decades.\n\nNevertheless, regular Valve rumourmonger Tyler McVicker seems convinced that White Sands relates to a project codenamed HLX, which dataminers discovered back in 2021.\n\nIn his latest video, McVicker doesn't explain why he's so sure of that, but he does point to other CVs in the recent past that mention an unannounced Valve game - one of which is definitely not describing a hero shooter, since it talks about 'combat encounters' and 'puzzles'.\n\nDatamined references to the HLX project include a main character wearing a HEV suit (hazardous environment suit - the same one Gordon Freeman wears), driveable vehicles, and various Xen (the aliens from the series) creatures, including a 'Xen gorilla'.\n\nIt seems that whatever HLX is, Valve has been working on it for the last four years, which in theory means it could be announced anytime now.\n\nThe problem with all this though is that Valve cancels far more games than it ever releases. That's common in the games industry but Valve takes it to such extremes it's the main reason they've released so little over the last s.\n\nCompared to Half-Life 3 rumours of the past, this one does seem more promising than usual, but at the end of the day it is just a rumour and it's going to need a lot more evidence than this to make Half-Life 3 seem like more than just a fan dream.\n\nEmail gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, follow us on Twitter, and sign-up to our newsletter.\n\nTo submit Inbox letters and Reader's Features more easily, without the need to send an email, just use our Submit Stuff page here.\n\nMORE : Massive Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 leak reveals all 20 multiplayer maps, menus, UI and more", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Half-Life (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_name", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Code name"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Valve Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Alyx", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Half-Life: Alyx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamescom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gamescom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_shooter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hero shooter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mesa_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Mesa (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuff_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuff (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Black_Ops", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Call of Duty: Black Ops"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metro (British newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extraterrestrial life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multiplayer video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puzzle video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "User interface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SEI_215930802-e27d.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C173px%2C1200px%2C631px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790833", "eventUri": "eng-9790833", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

We found out the codename of that title in 2021: HLX.\n\n\"There were arguments at the time and in the few following years that HLX wasn't actually representative of a fully-fledged game in development, but maybe could represent an engine feature, or was just a file format for saves.\n\n\"In the interim, I have been slowly and silently digging into this story. HLX is a confusing one. HLX seems to be a fully-fledged non-VR Half-Life game, something that seems too good to be true, and something that I wanted to be very sure of before going live with any of this information.\"\n\nMcVicker adds that as \"Valve is actively developing many titles on Source\" - perhaps most notably \"Citadel aka Neon Prime aka Deadlock\" - for a while, he couldn't be sure what HLX was.\n\n\"Half-Life Alyx was announced almost five year ago, and fully released over four and, as it turns out, that entire time has been spent developing the next major single-player title, codenamed HLX. And now - thanks to a screw up by one of the voice actors on the project - we now know the internal codename that Valve uses to hide the real project name whilst casting voice actors is called Project White Sands.\"\n\nInterestingly, McVicker points out that, like a lot of studios, Valve uses \"very random\" codenames, such as \"Hot Dog\" for Left 4 Dead VR and Left 4 Dead 3, and \"Jamiroquai\" for Half-Life Alyx. So quite why this one is so candidly associated with the Half-Life series, we're not sure.\n\nMcVicker has since \"learned a lot\" about the project via datamining. According to \"strings\" inside games like Dota 2, the character you play as \"in whatever HLX is\" wears a HEV Suit, and will go \"Offworld\" where there are \"workers\", \"storks\", \"pentatanks\", \"feral man hacks\", and \"Xengorillas, Xenjellyfish, and Xenswoopers\". McVicker reckons these things were initially cut from Half-Life Alyx but have \"continued to receive some form of development according to the most recent updates to Valve's Source 2 projects\".\n\n\"Do I think this is Half-Life 3?\" McVicker adds. \"I gotta be very careful in answering that question.\n\n\"But yes.\"\n\nVickers added: \"I think this is a non-VR, Half-Life game [in which] you play a HEV Suit-wearing character in development at Valve Software that has been in development since Half-Life Alyx.\"\n\nThe actor's website that revealed Project White Sands to the world last night has already been updated to remove the reference.", "source": {"uri": "eurogamer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurogamer.net"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Half-Life (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Valve Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_name", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Code name"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-player_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-player video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-production", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pre-production"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_4_Dead", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left 4 Dead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "File format"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Source 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Half-Life (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamiroquai", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamiroquai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "String (computer science)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dota 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/htc-sorry-for-half-life-tease-142547867143.jpg?width=1200&height=600&fit=crop&enable=upscale&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790833", "eventUri": "eng-9790833", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Someone on the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit spotted it, and now we're off to the races one more time.\n\nWhile previous leaks have established Valve has a multiplayer shooter in the works called Deadlock, that was codenamed Citadel and later Neon Prime. The codename \"White Sands\" does resonate with Half-Life's Black Mesa, and is the name of a NASA testing facility and a missile range in New Mexico. (It was the missile range where the first atomic bomb test detonation took place in 1945.)\n\nWe last heard rumblings of a new Half-Life game back in February, when data strings found in a Counter-Strike 2 update hinted at the existence of two projects in development at Valve. One was the previously mentioned Citadel, which evolved into Deadlock, while the other appeared with the initials \"hlx\".

White Sands is a real-life NASA facility in the state of New Mexico, which just happens to be the state where the original Half-Life took place within the (entirely fictional) Black Mesa facility.\n\nHalf-Life and Valve expert and dataminer Tyler McVicker weighed in on the situation just a few hours later. McVicker claims that Valve has an entirely new, non-virtual reality, Half-Life game in development, under the codename 'HLX.' This game is entirely separate from the in-development Deadlock, the new Valve-made hero shooter that leaked online earlier this year.\n\nMcVicker posits that Project White Sands and HLX are one and the same, and that the project has been in development since Half-Life: Alyx launched over four years ago. The dataminer also claims to have found code in DOTA 2 and Counter-Strike 2 revealing that the player character in Project White Sands wears a HEV suit, and also goes \"off-world.\"\n\nThere's also been reference made to driveable vehicles in Project White Sands thanks to said code, as well as \"xengorilla,\" which directly references a feature cut from Half-Life: Alyx. McVicker claims that, from the in-game code, we know that cut Alyx features like \"xengorilla\" have received updates and are still being worked on in some capacity since Alyx launched.\n\nBack in 2021, McVicker himself claimed that Half-Life 3 had actually been scrapped in favor of a Steam Deck-dedicated game, one that would blend RTS and FPS gameplay, so there's some slightly conflicting information out there right now.", "source": {"uri": "gamesradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "gamesradar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hirun_cryer@gamesradar.com", "name": "Hirun Cryer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Half-Life (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Valve Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mesa_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black Mesa (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_shooter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hero shooter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Alyx", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Half-Life: Alyx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_leak", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet leak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steam (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_character", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Player character"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dota 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First-person shooter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Counter-Strike"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CjqPaMCK8oyi9cvaUjdSRZ-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790833", "eventUri": "eng-9790833", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Previously known as Valve News Network, Valve has gone on record that McVicker does not have insider information in the company. As far as we know, McVicker has never disputed that, and has been open that what he finds out about Valve's games comes from datamining. Like Tyler, we won't share the identities of the people involved in this rumor, and we can verify that his information matches up to what we found on our own.\n\nIn his latest video, Tyler says that he knew about Valve making a new Half-Life game for some time now. He had been tracking data with the tags HLX, and explained that this tag started coming up after Valve announced Half-Life: Alyx, but before it released, sometime in 2021.\n\nTyler believes that this unannounced Half-Life game is \"fully-fledged\", perhaps suggesting that it's at least eight hours long or longer, and that it isn't a VR title. \"As he put it, something that's too good to be true.\"\n\nTyler was hesitant to go forward with this information, and was slowly collecting more data. However, he was suddenly compelled to share some of what he knew because of the new revelations. An actress' website resume was updated to indicate that she worked on a Project White Sand for Valve.\n\nTyler pointed out that Valve has previously used codenames that had nothing to do with the games they were making. Valve is somewhat more lenient and open, and so they are more vulnerable to data leaks. This was how Deadlock got revealed far in advance; Valve invited in some beta testers who didn't have the druthers to keep Valve's trust. So, using random codenames is a small thing they do to protect their projects' secrets.\n\nTyler also brings up another anonymized source. This person also indicated that they worked for Valve in their resume, from 2020 to 2023. They worked on level design, layouts, lighting, combat encounters, and puzzles.\n\nTyler found that the player character wears an HEV suit, and that they go offworld. These are the other tags that they have found, that evoke possible things, and surprises for this upcoming game:\n\nFor those wondering, Tyler does claim that the Xen gorilla, Xen jellyfish, and Xen swooper are references to things that could have been in Half-Life: Alyx, but ended up getting cut.\n\nTyler ends this video by stating he believes Project White Sands and HLX are the same game, and that it is Half-Life 3. He claims to have more data that he is still collating, and will share an even bigger video in the future, to seemingly prove his claims.\n\nWe will leave this information at that, since if this does turn out to be Half-Life 3, Valve isn't likely to deny it. We really just need to wait and see how this latest round of rumors plays out. If Tyler's information is correct, Valve has been making Half-Life 3 for the last four years now. If they're not ready to release it yet, they will be releasing it in one to two years from now.", "source": {"uri": "gameranx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gameranx"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_parreno@gameranx.com", "name": "Ryan Parreno", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Valve Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Half-Life (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Alyx", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Half-Life: Alyx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_name", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Code name"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Level (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_character", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Player character"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gorilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puzzle video game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality/Multi-User_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality/Multi-User Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://gameranx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Gabe-Newell-Steam-Valve-2024.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790833", "eventUri": "eng-9790833", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

In case you were waiting for anything more substantial, keep waiting - that's all there is to it, as is basically always the case when it comes to HL3.\n\nAs has been remarked in the context of the recent Epic Games Store leak, studios generally don't use codenames for projects that are connected to their contents, as it would run against the whole reason for using them in the first place - so chances are, even if White Sands still exists (and with how Valve operates, that's not necessarily the case) it's not connected to the fabled and elusive third Half-Life game.\n\nSo there you have it - your monthly dose of Half-Life 3 copium, in case you're still on that.\n\nValve is currently working on a hero-shooter called Deadlock, which was known under the codenames Neon Prime and Citadel at various stages of development, and is undergoing closed playtests at the moment.", "source": {"uri": "videogames.si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Video Games"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Half-Life (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Missile Range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Valve Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mesa_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Mesa (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games_Store", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epic Games Store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playtest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playtest"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles/Brain_Teasers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles/Brain Teasers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3840,h_2160,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/video_games/01j4gyeeg0x1h4vwehya.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790833", "eventUri": "eng-9790833", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Well, it looks like oinkers could soon evolve wings, because a new rumor has reignited the hope that one of the most anticipated (but never confirmed) video games ever could genuinely be in development.\n\nA voice actor has accidentally let slip they've been working on a new Valve title codenamed \"Project White Sands\" (thanks, Notebookcheck). A particularly observant Reddit user first clocked a post that has subsequently been deleted on a voice actor's profile page, which itself is currently down. Presumably because all the Gordon Freeman fans have desperately been trying to access said page.\n\nThe main reason this feels significant is that Project White Sands definitely isn't the already leaked \"Deadlock\" -- a 6 vs 6 third-person shooter Gabe Newell and co. are currently working on (thanking you, Insider Gaming).\n\nThat most likely leaves us with two main scenarios regarding Project White Sands: it's either Half-Life 3 itself or a sequel to the incredible VR puzzle-heavy shooter, Half-Life Alyx. And on the topic of Alyx, the wonderful 2020 virtual reality experience will be available to play on PSVR 2 on PC in August thanks to a new Steam app and PlayStation adapter.\n\nAs for the connotations of what that codename may mean in terms of a possible gameplay setting? Folks on Reddit are already speculating that it could mean that whatever this potential Freeman-related sequel could be will either be a snowy location or based in the original Half-Life's New Mexico location -- which launched all the way back in 1998 when the best gaming PCs were roughly as powerful as a pocket calculator.\n\nFor context, the last time we saw Goggsy take the business end of his legendary crowbar to a Headcrab was in Half-Life 2: Episode 2; a short but compelling piece of DLC that launched in October 2007. Before that, the incredible Half-Life 2 was released a year after the launch of Steam on November 16, 2004.\n\nWhile you should take all of the above with as many pinches of salt as you can fit in your palms, it's still at least heartening that after so much speculation and years of desperate pleas for Half-Life 3, Valve may finally be working on a shooter that fans have been requesting for the longest time.", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_meikleham@tomsguide.com", "name": "Dave Meikleham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Half-Life (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_VR", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation VR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabe_Newell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gabe Newell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-person_shooter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third-person shooter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valve Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steam (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headcrab", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Headcrab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Half-Life 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calculator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaming_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaming computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downloadable content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality/Multi-User_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality/Multi-User Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cF66sKaNki9wEEqR4udFQ9-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790833", "eventUri": "eng-9790833", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2004-11-16", "textStart": 2107, "textEnd": 2124}, {"amb": false, "date": "2007-10-", "textStart": 2004, "textEnd": 2016}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

This is due to the resume directly mentioning that it was a project with Valve, and also that \"White Sands\" is a park and missile range in New Mexico. Protagonist Gordon Freeman's former employer, Black Mesa, is located in the New Mexico desert.\n\nNow, Valve expert Tyler McVicker has created a video explaining why he thinks Project White Sands could be the next fully fledged non-VR Half-Life game. He reported that another single-player Half-Life game was in pre-production around the same time as Half-Life: Alyx, and the codename was HLX.\n\nThrough datamining Valve's Source 2 projects and games like Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2, Vickers said that the character in HLX wears an HEV suit and goes \"off-world,\" to places with things like \"xengorillas,\" and \"pentatanks.\" He thinks that these were actually cut from Half-Life: Alyx but were still being worked on in some capacity.\n\nHe also initially wasn't sure if HLX was just an engine feature or file format for saves, but due to the recent leak from the voice actor, he believes that Project White Sands is the internal codename of HLX.\n\nVickers finished the video saying that he thinks the project is in fact Half-Life 3.

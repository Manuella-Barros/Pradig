Thank you for everything, thank you for this moment,\" a smiling Argamani said, sitting with her father in a hospital room. In another video, speaking on the phone with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Argamani said, \"I am very moved. I haven't heard Hebrew for so long.\" An earlier video of Argamani reunited with her father showed her smiling and embracing him. She was kidnapped along with her boyfriend Avinatan Or from the Supernova festival on the morning of Oct 7. Her boyfriend is believed to remain in captivity. Argamani became one of the faces of the hostage crisis when footage of her abduction by two men on a motorbike emerged online. In the footage, a distraught Argamani shouts: \"Don't kill me!\"", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/israel-rescues-four-hostages-gaza-palestine-say-50-dead-assault-4396626", "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--_XsSDRkb--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2024-06-08t121758z_1_lynxmpek57044_rtroptp_3_israel-palestinian", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:13:00", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "sg", "sentiment": 0.431}

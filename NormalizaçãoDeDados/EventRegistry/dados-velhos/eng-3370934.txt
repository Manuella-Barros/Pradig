(AP) - Yul Moldauer always believed the time would come when he would be part of the group at the forefront of the U.S. men's gymnastics program.\n\nThe irony is now that the time has finally arrived, Moldauer spends copious amounts of energy focusing on not thinking about the stage or the stakes. Standing on the podium Thursday night during the opening round of the 2017 U.S. championships, Moldauer did his best to clear his mind.\n\nSo he did what a lot of 20-year-old guys do. He took deep breaths. And he thought about cars.\n\n\"Just to get my mind off (the meet) real quick,\" Moldauer said. \"Then, when my hand raises, I trust my training.\"\n\nIt's working. Moldauer put together six steady routines to open up a sizable gap over reigning NCAA all-around champion Akash Modi and give him some serious momentum in his attempt to lock down a spot on the world championship team this fall.\n\nMoldauer, who won the 2016 NCAA all-around title at Oklahoma and the American Cup earlier this year, posted a score of 86.650, nearly two points clear of Modi at 84.700.\n\n\"I'm ready to be one of the bigger guys that the young guys look up to,\" Moldauer said. \"Knowing that worlds is on the line, it's a big deal. But you don't want to let that get to your nerves.\"\n\nMoldauer hardly looked nervous while tying for the highest score on parallel bars (14.7) and finishing in the top five on each of the other five events to create some breathing room between himself and the rest of a wide-open field heading into Saturday night's final round.\n\n\"I know I can clean up some things,\" Moldauer said. \"It's good knowing I didn't get my perfect routines tonight so I can focus on what I need to fix going into Day 2.\"\n\nModi, an alternate on the 2016 Olympic team, was every bit Moldauer's equal save for a skittish performance on pommel horse. Racing through his routine, Modi hopped off in the middle. He regrouped on rings, showing the kind of mental toughness that can be a valuable commodity in high-pressure situations.\n\n\"When I'm doing gymnastics, everything stops,\" Modi said. \"It doesn't matter. I'm just doing what I'm doing. When I was doing my routine on rings, I wasn't thinking about my horse routine.\"\n\nAllan Bower, a teammate of Moldauer's at Oklahoma, is third. Donnell Whittenburg, an Olympic alternate last summer searching to regain the form that made him an all-around finalist at the 2015 world championships, struggled on pommel horse but finished with a flourish. His 15.000 on still rings, his final event, was the best of the night and moved him into fourth.\n\nThe men's program is in the midst of a generational shift as most of the group that served as the core of the 2012 and 2016 Olympic teams has moved on into retirement. Moldauer, Modi and Bower are in the group leading the next wave, though the veterans still hanging around are hardly done.\n\nAlex Naddour, a bronze medalist on pommel horse at the 2016 Olympics, scored 15.3 on his signature event, the best score of the night on any apparatus. Even more impressive? His 14.750 on still rings, a number he put up despite skipping the event for four months to let a strained muscle near his right elbow heal.\n\nFour-time national champion Sam Mikulak, limited to competing on pommel horse and high bar as he works his way back from a torn Achilles, pumped his fist after putting together a solid set on pommels, fueling his hope that he'll be able to contribute at worlds in Montreal in October.\n\nThere is no team competition at worlds, only individual events, giving recently named high performance director Brett McClure and the rest of the selection committee plenty of options as it tries to put together the six-man group that will be announced by the end of the weekend.\n\nNaddour said he's already putting the puzzle pieces together for how a world championship team might shake out. He certainly looks like he fits. Modi and Moldauer almost certainly do too. McClure's directness also helps eliminate any sort of gray areas.\n\n\"Brett has made it about the numbers,\" Modi said. \"It doesn't matter what you do anywhere else, you have to get the numbers.\"\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- Yul Moldauer always believed the time would come when he would be part of the group at the forefront of the U.S. men's gymnastics program.\n\nThe irony is now that the time has finally arrived, Moldauer spends copious amounts of energy focusing on not thinking about the stage or the stakes. Standing on the podium Thursday night during the opening round of the 2017 U.S. championships, Moldauer did his best to clear his mind.\n\nSo he did what a lot of 20-year-old guys do. He took deep breaths. And he thought about cars.\n\n\"Just to get my mind off (the meet) real quick,\" Moldauer said. \"Then, when my hand raises, I trust my training.\"\n\nIt's working. Moldauer put together six steady routines to open up a sizable gap over reigning NCAA all-around champion Akash Modi and give him some serious momentum in his attempt to lock down a spot on the world championship team this fall.\n\nMoldauer, who won the 2016 NCAA all-around title at Oklahoma and the American Cup earlier this year, posted a score of 86.650, nearly two points clear of Modi at 84.700.\n\n\"I'm ready to be one of the bigger guys that the young guys look up to,\" Moldauer said. \"Knowing that worlds is on the line, it's a big deal. But you don't want to let that get to your nerves.\"\n\nMoldauer hardly looked nervous while tying for the highest score on parallel bars (14.7) and finishing in the top five on each of the other five events to create some breathing room between himself and the rest of a wide-open field heading into Saturday night's final round.\n\n\"I know I can clean up some things,\" Moldauer said. \"It's good knowing I didn't get my perfect routines tonight so I can focus on what I need to fix going into Day 2.\"\n\nModi, an alternate on the 2016 Olympic team, was every bit Moldauer's equal save for a skittish performance on pommel horse. Racing through his routine, Modi hopped off in the middle. He regrouped on rings, showing the kind of mental toughness that can be a valuable commodity in high-pressure situations.\n\n\"When I'm doing gymnastics, everything stops,\" Modi said. \"It doesn't matter. I'm just doing what I'm doing. When I was doing my routine on rings, I wasn't thinking about my horse routine.\"\n\nAllan Bower, a teammate of Moldauer's at Oklahoma, is third. Donnell Whittenburg, an Olympic alternate last summer searching to regain the form that made him an all-around finalist at the 2015 world championships, struggled on pommel horse but finished with a flourish. His 15.000 on still rings, his final event, was the best of the night and moved him into fourth.\n\nThe men's program is in the midst of a generational shift as most of the group that served as the core of the 2012 and 2016 Olympic teams has moved on into retirement. Moldauer, Modi and Bower are in the group leading the next wave, though the veterans still hanging around are hardly done.\n\nAlex Naddour, a bronze medalist on pommel horse at the 2016 Olympics, scored 15.3 on his signature event, the best score of the night on any apparatus. Even more impressive? His 14.750 on still rings, a number he put up despite skipping the event for four months to let a strained muscle near his right elbow heal.\n\nFour-time national champion Sam Mikulak, limited to competing on pommel horse and high bar as he works his way back from a torn Achilles, pumped his fist after putting together a solid set on pommels, fueling his hope that he'll be able to contribute at worlds in Montreal in October.\n\nThere is no team competition at worlds, only individual events, giving recently named high performance director Brett McClure and the rest of the selection committee plenty of options as it tries to put together the six-man group that will be announced by the end of the weekend.\n\nNaddour said he's already putting the puzzle pieces together for how a world championship team might shake out.

Actually it ended in February, when the Orange County native tore his Achilles tendon.\n\nThe first day of the P&G Championships at Honda Center was when he officially removed himself from the running by competing in just two of the six events at the U.S. national championship event.\n\nFour consecutive years as the all-around champ was a good run, to put it lightly. He was the first to accomplish the feat since Blaine Wilson won five in a row more than two decades ago.\n\nMaking his return from the worst in a series of Achilles injuries, Mikulak strategically avoided the events that put more emphasis on the lower body.\n\nHe made his showings in the high bar and pommel horse count.\n\nHis 14.050 in the high bar was tied for the second-highest score in the event on Thursday behind a 14.200 by Stanford's Akash Modi. His 14.750 on the pommel horse, the third-highest score in the event, prompted an emphatic fist pump from the 2016 Olympian.\n\nMikulak, 24, and Alex Naddor, the 2016 Olympic bronze medalist in the pommel horse, are expected to make up the core of the team the U.S. sends to the World Championships in Montreal Oct. 2-8. The rest of the field was trying to impress at the P&G Championships in an effort to fill out the roster.\n\nNaddor posted Thursday's top score in the pommel horse, registering a 15.300 in his first event of the night.\n\nThe University of Oklahoma's Yul Moldauer led the all-around competition after the first of two days of competition with a cumulative score of 86.650. It wasn't a surprise to see the up and coming gymnast from one of the nation's best collegiate programs at the top of the leaderboard.\n\nOne can only wonder where Mikulak, 24, would rank had he not torn his Achilles at the Winter Cup in Las Vegas, his first competition since the Rio Olympics.\n\nMikulak, who was born in Huntington Beach, raised in Newport Coast and is a Corona Del Mar High graduate, is perhaps the best American male gymnast of the past decade. He arrived at the 2016 Olympics a contender for multiple medals, but his best performance in Rio De Janeiro was a fourth-place finish on the high bar, likely a hop on the landing away from a silver medal.\n\nHe placed seventh in the all-around, eighth in the floor exercise and was part of the Americans' fifth-place team finish in Rio.\n\nThe seven-time NCAA champion at Michigan, including three all-around crowns, returned from the 2015 Pan American Games with gold medals in the team and all-around competitions and bronze medals in the floor exercise and parallel bars.", "dateTime":

Moldauer had led after the prelims Thursday night, and even with a fall on high bar, he never allowed anyone to make a serious run at him during the finals.\n\nHe was so consistently solid that he simply needed to stay on parallel bars, his final event. He did that with ease -- until the last couple of seconds. As he flipped and twisted in the air, one of his legs collided with the rail.\n\nIt's the kind of thing that could send a gymnast crashing into the apparatus or onto the floor. But Moldauer steadied himself with catlike quickness, flashing a grin as he landed and thrust his arms into the air. Coach Mark Williams ran onto the podium and wrapped him in a bear hug.\n\nMoldauer finished with the highest score on floor exercise and the second-highest on parallel bars.\n\nMore: Aly Raisman criticizes USA Gymnastics, USOC for sex abuse response\n\nMore: Sam Mikulak delivers on expectations by not caring about them\n\nMore: Simone Biles is back in gym but don't call it a comeback yet\n\nNot only is it Moldauer's first title, it's the first time in four years that someone besides Sam Mikulak has stood atop the U.S. podium.\n\nMikulak, a two-time Olympian, blew out his Achilles in February and was limited to doing just pommel horse and high bar this week. Still, those two events were likely enough to earn Mikulak a spot on the team for the world championships. He finished with the second-best score on pommel horse and was third on high bar even with a fall.\n\nAlex Naddour, the only other Rio Olympian besides Mikulak still competing, showed he's still got it, too. He had the top score on pommel horse, where he's the reigning Olympic bronze medalist, and was fourth on still rings.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T04:03:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6941176652908325, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3370934", "time": "04:03:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370934", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "195392", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "227084", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302553", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "score": 2}, {"id": "302625", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Olympic Committee"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Olympic_Committee", "score": 2}, {"id": "303724", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "USA Gymnastics"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Gymnastics", "score": 2}, {"id": "308396", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "score": 3}, {"id": "310319", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Gym"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "score": 2}, {"id": "317566", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Aly Raisman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aly_Raisman", "score": 2}, {"id": "317570", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "score": 2}, {"id": "317575", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "score": 2}, {"id": "318392", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Horizontal bar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_bar", "score": 3}, {"id": "321870", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Bear"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear", "score": 2}, {"id": "330144", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "score": 2}, {"id": "331012", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Achilles"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles", "score": 2}, {"id": "335231", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Parallel bars"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_bars", "score": 5}, {"id": "347382", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sam Mikulak"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Mikulak", "score": 3}, {"id": "1333631", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Alexander Naddour"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Naddour", "score": 1}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2fbf35ad829db1f5cf302993bf22591cb65cd381/c=0-54-1023-632&r=x803&c=1600x800/local/-/media/2017/08/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636387833188061583-USP-GYMNASTICS-2017-P-G-GYMNASTICS-CHAMPIONSHIPS-93132683.JPG", "wgt": 1, "timeCrawl": "04:03:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Yul Moldauer wins first men's gymnastics title at P&G Championships", "originalArticle": null}], "pages": 16}}}

The proposed amendments seek to significantly reform the law by enhancing the Centre's regulatory authority over waqf properties and, for the first time, permitting the inclusion of non-Muslim members in Waqf Boards. The draft legislation, proposed to be renamed the Unified Waqf Management, Empowerment, Efficiency, and Development Act, 2024, is heralded by the government as a comprehensive overhaul aimed at enhancing \"the efficiency of the administration and management of the waqf properties.\"\n\nHowever, several Opposition parties have accused the Centre of floating the Bill without adequate consultation with stakeholders, claiming it encroaches upon the Muslim community's religious rights. They have also pointed out that the amendments will reduce Waqf Boards to \"mute spectators\" even as the Centre infringes upon a host of religious freedoms.\n\nAny change in Wakf Act will not be tolerated, says Muslim Personal Law Board'Waqf' law in India\n\nIn Islamic law, waqf refers to property dedicated in the name of God for religious and charitable purposes. This can include any movable or immovable property set aside for the public good, embodying an act of piety that allows Muslims to extend their charitable deeds beyond their lifetime. A waqf can be established through a formal deed or instrument, or a property can be deemed waqf if it has been used for religious or charitable purposes over an extended period. The proceeds from such properties are typically used to maintain mosques, fund schools or provide for the poor. However, once designated as waqf, the property cannot be transferred through inheritance, sold, or given away. A non-Muslim is also allowed to create a waqf as long as the objective of creating it with Islamic principles.\n\nIn India, waqfs are regulated by the 1995 Act. Waqf properties are identified and delineated through a survey conducted by the State government. A survey commissioner, appointed under the Act, identifies these properties through local investigations, witness testimonies, and review of public documents. Once identified, the properties are recorded in the State's official gazette, and a list is maintained by the State Waqf Board. Each waqf is managed by a mutawalli (custodian) who oversees its administration. While similar to a trust established under the Indian Trusts Act of 1882, a waqf, unlike a trust, cannot be dissolved by a Board.\n\nCongress to oppose introduction of Waqf BillThe role of the Waqf Board\n\nThe 1995 Act establishes Waqf Boards in each State to oversee the administration of waqf properties within their jurisdiction. These Boards are considered juristic persons, allowing them to sue or be sued in a court of law. Each State Waqf Board has a chairperson and includes one or two nominees from the State government, Muslim legislators, recognised Islamic scholars, and mutawalli of the waqfs. The Act also mandates the appointment of a full-time Chief Executive Officer for each Board, who must be a Muslim by faith and hold at least the rank of Deputy Secretary in the State government.\n\nThe Waqf Board is authorised to manage waqf properties and take measures to recover lost assets. It can also sanction the transfer of immovable waqf property through sale, gift, mortgage, exchange, or lease. However, this would require the approval of at least two-thirds of the Board members. Amendments to the 1995 Act in 2013 further strengthened the Board's authority and made the sale of waqf properties nearly impossible, as neither the mutawalli nor the Board had the right to sell a waqf property.\n\nIn addition to the State Waqf Boards, the legislation also establishes the Central Waqf Council -- a national advisory body under the Ministry of Minority Affairs. The Council ensures the uniform administration of waqf properties across the country and is headed by the Union Minister of Minority Affairs. It also advises the Union government on waqf-related issues, including policy development, implementation of waqf laws, and resolution of inter-State disputes.\n\n'Further improvement' necessary\n\nAccording to the Bill, which has been accessed by The Hindu, the 1995 Act has proven to be ineffective in dealing with the administration of auqaf (plural of waqf). Its statement of objects and reasons note that following the recommendations of a high-level committee headed by Justice (Retired) Rajinder Sachar and the recommendations of a Joint Parliamentary Committee on Waqf and Central Waqf Council, comprehensive amendments were introduced in 2013 after extensive consultations with various stakeholders.\n\n\"Despite the amendments, it has been observed that the Act still requires further improvement to effectively address issues related to the powers of the State Waqf Boards, registration and survey of waqf properties, removal of encroachments, including the definition of the 'waqf' itself,\" the statement added.\n\nKey changes in the proposed law\n\nDefinition of 'waqf' altered\n\nUnder the Bill, only lawful property owners who have practised Islam for at least five years are authorised to create 'waqf' properties through the execution of formal deeds. This revision abolishes the 'waqf by use' concept -- which permits a property to be considered waqf based on usage, even if the original deed was disputed. Traditionally, waqf properties were often dedicated orally until formal documentation became standard practice.\n\nTo prevent any fraudulent waqf claims, the Bill stipulates, \"Any government property identified or declared as waqf property, before or after the commencement of this Act, shall not be recognized as waqf property.\" Additionally, the law permits widows, divorced women, and orphans to be beneficiaries of proceeds from waqf assets.\n\nWaqf amendment Bill introduces District Collector as an arbiter to decide whether a property is a Waqf or government land\n\nPower reposed in District Collectors\n\nThe responsibility of surveying waqf properties, previously managed by survey commissioners under the 1995 Act, will now be assigned to district collectors or officers of equivalent rank. To improve the accuracy of waqf property records, the Bill proposes a centralised registration system. All information about waqf properties must be uploaded to this portal within six months of the new law's enactment. Moreover, any new waqf property registrations must be submitted exclusively through this portal to the Waqf Boards.\n\nNotably, the Bill omits section 40, which previously granted waqf tribunals the authority to determine whether a property qualifies as waqf. Instead, it designates the district collector as the final arbiter in such matters. Once a determination is made, the collector must update the revenue records and submit a report to the State government. However, the Bill makes it clear that the disputed property cannot be treated as a waqf property till the collector submits his final report. This implies that until the government decides the issue, a Waqf Board cannot be in control of the disputed land.\n\nMuslim bodies hit out at Waqf Bill, plan to move court\n\nInclusion of 'non-Muslims'\n\nOne of the most contentious aspects of the Bill is the proposed inclusion of non-Muslims in key waqf institutions -- the Central Waqf Council, State Waqf Boards, and waqf tribunals. It empowers the Centre to appoint three Members of Parliament (two from the Lok Sabha and one from the Rajya Sabha) to the Central Waqf Council without specifying that they have to be Muslims. Under the 1995 Act, the three MPs to be included in the Council had to be from the Muslim community. Similarly, as per the new Bill, State Waqf Boards have to include two non-Muslims and two women as members.\n\nThe composition of waqf tribunals has been changed from a three-member body to a two-member body. The tribunal will now consist of a district judge and an officer of joint secretary rank to the State government. Under the proposed law, tribunals must resolve disputes within six months, with a possible extension of an additional six months.\n\nStringent financial oversight\n\nThe Bill empowers the Centre to \"direct the audit of any waqf at any time by an auditor appointed by the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India, or by any officer designated by the Central Government for that purpose.\" The Waqf Boards are required to audit their accounts annually, selecting auditors from a panel constituted by the State governments. Penalties will also be levelled upon mutawallis if they fail to maintain proper accounts.\n\nWaqf amendment Bill: BJP allies JD(U), TDP to support the Bill\n\nJudicial review permissible\n\nThe proposed law allows courts to intervene in waqf disputes. It removes the finality of decisions made by waqf tribunals, allowing aggrieved parties to appeal directly to the concerned High Court. This is aimed at increasing judicial oversight and curbing instances of arbitrary exercise of power by Waqf Boards or tribunals.\n\nPotential implications and the way forward\n\nProfessor Faizan Mustafa, noted academician and Vice Chancellor of Chanakya National Law University, Patna, told The Hindu that while the amendments are a welcome step, it is crucial to implement measures that adequately protect waqf properties without infringing upon the freedom of religion guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution. \"Rights vested in waqf properties hundreds of years ago cannot be taken over by executive officers without fair judicial determination,\" he added.\n\nHe also noted that the increased centralisation of waqf property management might undermine the autonomy of Muslim religious institutions. Regarding the inclusion of non-Muslims in waqf governance, Mr. Mustafa questioned, \"Will non-Hindus be allowed on Hindu temple boards in States such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka?\" He further asserted that excessive government control is at odds with the principles of economic liberalisation.\n\nAfter its introduction in Parliament, the Bill was referred to a joint parliamentary panel for further scrutiny after the Congess-led Indian National Democratic Inclusive Alliance opposed the proposed law in its present form. In March last year, the Union government apprised the Delhi High Court that close to 120 petitions challenging various provisions of the 1995 Act are pending before courts across the country.\n\nRead

Critics have labelled the bill as \"unconstitutional\" and an infringement on religious freedoms. However, Rijiju, who serves as the Minority Affairs Minister, asserted that the bill is designed to enhance the rights of those who have been marginalised rather than infringe on anyone's liberties.\n\nSpeaking for nearly an hour, Rijiju stressed that the bill does not encroach upon the freedoms guaranteed to religious institutions under Articles 25 to 30 of the Constitution. He highlighted that the bill's primary aim is to rectify existing issues surrounding waqf lands and to ensure that the management of these properties is more transparent and equitable.\n\nINDIA bloc walks out of Rajya Sabha after denied discussion on Vinesh Phogat's Olympic disqualification\n\nA notable feature of the new bill is the inclusion of women members in both state waqf boards and the central council. Rijiju highlighted that this provision aims to bring greater inclusivity to the management of waqf properties.\n\nThe Minister also addressed concerns about the inheritance of waqf lands, noting that current regulations sometimes prevent children from inheriting property due to the lands being classified as waqf. Rijiju cited a specific case where municipal land was incorrectly designated as waqf property, a scenario the new bill seeks to address.\n\nFurther defending the bill, Rijiju claimed that the government has received numerous complaints about illegal encroachments and transfers of waqf lands, with allegations of \"mafia\" involvement. He also refuted claims by the Opposition that there was a lack of consultation before the bill's introduction, stating that extensive consultations occurred at multiple levels, including with state governments, Waqf board chairmen, and other stakeholders since 2015.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [{"uri": "team_asianet_newsable@newsable.asianetnews.com", "name": "Team Asianet Newsable", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiren_Rijiju", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kiren Rijiju"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waqf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Waqf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union Council of Ministers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer Management", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Undeveloped_or_Vacant", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Undeveloped or Vacant", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Consulting", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://static-gi.asianetnews.com/images/01j4rg59pjg9h6fheywrqxywav/kiren-rijiju.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801291", "eventUri": "eng-9801291", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 41, "textEnd": 49}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

The decision of the collector will be final in relation to ownership,\" Madani said.\n\nAlso Read | Festive Season 2024: E-Commerce Sector To Hire 10 Lakh Gig Workers, 2.5 Lakh Contractual Staff This Festive Season, Says TeamLease Services.\n\n\"Earlier this right was with the Waqf Tribunal. The proposed amendment to the Waqf Act is also against the religious freedom granted by the Constitution and is in violation of Articles 14, 15 and 25 of the Constitution,\" he said.\n\nHe alleged that ever since this government has come, it has been bringing such new laws to keep Muslims in \"fear\". The proposed legislation is an open interference in the religious matters of Muslims, he said.\n\n\"The Jamiat wants to make it clear that we will never accept any such change in the Waqf Act, 2013 that changes or weakens the status or nature of Waqf properties. Jamiat Ulame-e-Hind has always taken effective steps to ensure the safety of waqf properties and even today we are moving ahead with the resolution that the Muslims of India will be against every plan of the government that does not guarantee the safety of waqf properties,\" he said in a statement.\n\nMaulana Mahmood Madani, who heads the other faction of the Jamiat, has expressed strong concerns regarding the proposed amendments to the Waqf Act. He said the amendments presented in Parliament are detrimental to the protection of waqf properties.\n\n\"These amendments would provide government bodies with unnecessary interference, undermining the original status of waqf and violating the concept of divine ownership,\" he said.\n\nHe pointed out that the proposal to abolish Section 40 of the Waqf Act and to grant district collectors the authority to resolve issues and disputes related to waqf property titles and possession under revenue laws instead of Waqf Tribunals is tantamount to \"nullifying the Waqf Board itself\".\n\nMahmood Madani urged the government to withdraw the proposed amendments and engage in a detailed consultation with all stakeholders, including religious leaders and waqf management bodies.\n\nJamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH) president Syed Sadatullah Husaini also criticised the Waqf Bill, saying it is unacceptable to the Muslim community.\n\n\"We oppose the proposed amendments by the government to the Waqf Act, 1995. The proposed changes are aimed at diminishing the autonomy and integrity of waqf properties and the communities they serve. This is not acceptable to the Muslim community,\" he said.\n\n\"We feel that this legislation has been designed to dismantle the established legal structure of waqfs, effectively targeting a constitutionally guaranteed right to the religious minorities that allows them to conduct and preserve their community's heritage and religious practices,\" Husaini said.\n\nThe amendments draw inspiration from outdated colonial laws, positioning the Collector as the ultimate authority, thereby stifling the rights of Muslims to manage their religious endowments, he alleged.\n\nHusaini said the fundamental aspect of waqf jurisprudence, the concept of waqf by user, which recognises long-standing religious and charitable use, is being removed. This change threatens to create further disputes over waqf properties. The amendment allows the state governments to appoint all members of the Waqf Board, effectively eliminating the democratic election of at least two members from Muslim communities, he said.\n\n\"In summation, we would like to state that the Bill was created without any consultation with the Muslim community. No Muslim parliamentarian was consulted regarding the Bill.\n\n\"No stakeholders were involved in the discussions about the Bill. The changes proposed in the law are harmful rather than beneficial. The government should withdraw the Bill,\" he said.\n\nHusaini said the JIH expects the opposition as well as the NDA allies like the JD(U) and the TDP to oppose and prevent such detrimental laws from being enacted.\n\nImam of Masjid Anglo-Arabic, Ajmeri Gate, Mufti Mohammad Qasim, said several properties of the waqf have been occupied and if the government wants to help the community, it should first get such properties vacated from illegal occupancy.\n\nThe Waqf (Amendment) Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha on Thursday and referred to a joint parliamentary panel after a heated debate, with the government asserting the proposed law did not intend to interfere with the functioning of mosques, and the opposition calling it targeting of Muslims and an attack on the Constitution.\n\nLok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said he will talk with leaders of all parties for constituting the joint parliamentary committee.\n\nSoon after Union Minority Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju sought leave to introduce the Bill, opposition INDIA bloc MPs strongly protested the introduction of the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, calling it an \"attack\" on the Constitution and stating that it targets Muslims.",

However, he vociferously rejected the Opposition's charge that the Bill is \"anti-constitutional, \"anti-Muslim\" and that the Centre does not have the legislative competence to bring amendments on issues related to waqf boards.\n\nBarring NDA allies Shiv Sena, JD(U) and TDP, opposition MPs led by the Congress attacked the government demanding that the Bill be either withdrawn or referred to a parliamentary committee. Congress's K.C. Venugopal said the Bill is a \"fundamental attack\" on the Constitution. \"We are Hindus but at the same time, we respect the faith of other religions...it's a direct attack on rights to religion and violates Article 26 (of the Constitution, which pertains to freedom to manage religious affairs),\" he said.\n\nAlso Read: 'Malicious act' or curbing graft? Muslim groups, waqf officials divided as Waqf Amendment Bill tabled\n\nVenugopal further said that the Bill, through amendments, proposes to make non-Muslims members of the governing body of state waqf boards and the Central Waqf Council.\n\n\"I would like to ask a question. Supreme Court constituted the board of Ayodhya (Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra), whether anybody can think that non-Hindu can be part of the Ayodhya mandir board,\" he said, alleging that the Bill had been brought with an eye on Haryana and Maharashtra elections.\n\n\"You do not understand that last time the people of India clearly taught you a lesson...this kind of divisive politics, India will not accept. It's an attack on the federal system, freedom of religion...,\" he added.\n\nSudip Bandyopadhyay of the Trinamool Congress said the Bill violates Article 14 of the Constitution that mandates that the state shall not deny any person equality before the law.\n\nThe DMK's Kanimozhi said it's a sad day in Parliament as many members in the House who took oath with the Constitution in hand are today going against it. She questioned the provision of allowing non-Muslims to be part of waqf boards. \"Would you allow non-Hindus to be part of a Hindu committee...Is it not unfair, against the law of natural justice?\" she asked\n\nShe further said: \"...It is a direct violation of Article 30 which allows minorities to administer their institutions. This Bill targets a particular religious group...It will destroy what our forefathers dreamt for this country.\"\n\nNCP's Supriya Sule charged the government with leaking the Bill to the media before introducing it in Parliament. \"The MPs found out about the Waqf Amendment (Bill) from the media, not the Parliament. Is this the new way to introduce Bills? This should not be a pattern.\"\n\nAkhilesh Yadav, head of the Samajwadi Party, the second largest opposition party in Lok Sabha after Congress, alleged that the BJP has brought the Bill to appease their hardline supporters after the setback in the Lok Sabha elections.\n\n\"When there is a democratic process for election, why nominate people? No person from outside the community is part of other religious bodies. What is the point of including non-Muslims in waqf bodies?\" he asked.\n\nYadav's remark that the government is out to curtail not only the rights of the Opposition but also the Speaker led to a face-off with Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who called it an insult of the Chair.\n\n\"...The rights of the Speaker do not belong to the Opposition, but to the whole House. Don't speak in a roundabout way. You are not the protector of the Speaker's rights,\" Shah said.\n\nAmong the two NDA allies - JD(U) and TDP - who supported the bill, Union minister and JD(U) leader Rajeev Ranjan Singh said those calling the amendments anti-Muslim do not understand the difference between mandirs (temple) and boards. \"... there is no attempt being made to tinker with mosques,\" he said.\n\nAdding that the bill is aimed at bringing transparency in the functioning of waqf boards, Singh alleged that the Opposition is trying to mislead the people on this issue. A minister in the Union government, he also referred to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots that followed the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and said it is ironic that those who indulged in killing thousands of Sikhs are calling the bill \"anti-Muslim.\"\n\nSupporting the bill, TDP's G.M. Harish (Balayogi) said registration of waqf properties will help poor Muslims, especially women, and bring transparency. He added that if wider consultations are needed to allay misconceptions, and to educate the Muslim community about this bill, \"we have no problem (in it) being sent to the select committee\".\n\nRevolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) MP N.K. Premachandran accused the government of trying to disempower the waqf board and the waqf council through the amendments. \"...You are dismantling the system. It is against the principles of the Constitution,\" he said, cautioning the government that if the Bill goes for judicial scrutiny, it would be struck down on constitutional grounds.\n\nAll India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi said the government does not have the legislative competence to bring the Bill.\n\nOwaisi said the Bill violates the principles of Articles 14, 15, and 25 of the Constitution. He said waqf management of a property is an essential religious practice for Muslims, adding that denying it legal recognition amounts to severely curtailing how Muslims manage their waqf properties.\n\n\"You are enemy of Muslims and this Bill is proof of that,\" Owaisi added.\n\nDefending the Bill, Rijiju said it aims at giving rights to those who never got them. He blamed the Opposition for misleading the people about the intention of the proposed Bill.\n\nRijiju said the government had to bring the amendments as the previous Congress governments could not do it. He said extensive consultations had happened prior to introducing the bill.\n\nRijiju further said that the Sachar committee, which was constituted by the UPA had in its report recommended that the present waqf board should be broad-based and poor women and children should be empowered.\n\nThe minority affairs minister said the government had received several complaints about the misuse of waqf properties. He cited the example of the Surat Municipal Corporation headquarters. The entire property was declared as waqf property, he said.\n\n\"In Karnataka, in 2012, a report of the Karnataka Minorities Commission said the Karnataka Waqf Board converted 29,000 acres to commercial land. \"Can you do it? Everybody knows that waqf properties are used for religious, charitable and pious purposes.\"\n\nRijiju said the Bill has been brought to give justice to ordinary Muslims.

The decision of the collector will be final in relation to ownership,\" Madani said.\n\n\"Earlier this right was with the Waqf Tribunal. The proposed amendment to the Waqf Act is also against the religious freedom granted by the Constitution and is in violation of Articles 14, 15 and 25 of the Constitution,\" he said.\n\nHe alleged that ever since this government has come, it has been bringing such new laws to keep Muslims in \"fear\". The proposed legislation is an open interference in the religious matters of Muslims, he said.\n\n\"The Jamiat wants to make it clear that we will never accept any such change in the Waqf Act, 2013 that changes or weakens the status or nature of Waqf properties. Jamiat Ulame-e-Hind has always taken effective steps to ensure the safety of waqf properties and even today we are moving ahead with the resolution that the Muslims of India will be against every plan of the government that does not guarantee the safety of waqf properties,\" he said in a statement.\n\nMaulana Mahmood Madani, who heads the other faction of the Jamiat, has expressed strong concerns regarding the proposed amendments to the Waqf Act. He said the amendments presented in Parliament are detrimental to the protection of waqf properties.\n\n\"These amendments would provide government bodies with unnecessary interference, undermining the original status of waqf and violating the concept of divine ownership,\" he said.\n\nHe pointed out that the proposal to abolish Section 40 of the Waqf Act and to grant district collectors the authority to resolve issues and disputes related to waqf property titles and possession under revenue laws instead of Waqf Tribunals is tantamount to \"nullifying the Waqf Board itself\".\n\nMahmood Madani urged the government to withdraw the proposed amendments and engage in a detailed consultation with all stakeholders, including religious leaders and waqf management bodies.\n\nJamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH) president Syed Sadatullah Husaini also criticised the Waqf Bill, saying it is unacceptable to the Muslim community.\n\n\"We oppose the proposed amendments by the government to the Waqf Act, 1995. The proposed changes are aimed at diminishing the autonomy and integrity of waqf properties and the communities they serve. This is not acceptable to the Muslim community,\" he said.\n\n\"We feel that this legislation has been designed to dismantle the established legal structure of waqfs, effectively targeting a constitutionally guaranteed right to the religious minorities that allows them to conduct and preserve their community's heritage and religious practices,\" Husaini said.\n\nThe amendments draw inspiration from outdated colonial laws, positioning the Collector as the ultimate authority, thereby stifling the rights of Muslims to manage their religious endowments, he alleged.\n\nHusaini said the fundamental aspect of waqf jurisprudence, the concept of waqf by user, which recognises long-standing religious and charitable use, is being removed. This change threatens to create further disputes over waqf properties. The amendment allows the state governments to appoint all members of the Waqf Board, effectively eliminating the democratic election of at least two members from Muslim communities, he said.\n\n\"In summation, we would like to state that the Bill was created without any consultation with the Muslim community. No Muslim parliamentarian was consulted regarding the Bill.\n\n\"No stakeholders were involved in the discussions about the Bill. The changes proposed in the law are harmful rather than beneficial. The government should withdraw the Bill,\" he said.\n\nHusaini said the JIH expects the opposition as well as the NDA allies like the JD(U) and the TDP to oppose and prevent such detrimental laws from being enacted.\n\nImam of Masjid Anglo-Arabic, Ajmeri Gate, Mufti Mohammad Qasim, said several properties of the waqf have been occupied and if the government wants to help the community, it should first get such properties vacated from illegal occupancy.\n\nThe Waqf (Amendment) Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha on Thursday and referred to a joint parliamentary panel after a heated debate, with the government asserting the proposed law did not intend to interfere with the functioning of mosques, and the opposition calling it targeting of Muslims and an attack on the Constitution.\n\nLok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said he will talk with leaders of all parties for constituting the joint parliamentary committee.\n\nSoon after Union Minority Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju sought leave to introduce the Bill, opposition INDIA bloc MPs strongly protested the introduction of the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, calling it an \"attack\" on the Constitution and stating that it targets Muslims.

Syed Farid Ahmed Nizami, Sajjadanashin of Dargah Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia, and President of the Dargah Management Committee, expressed his dissatisfaction with the proposed amendments to the existing Waqf Act.\n\n\"The current bill has some flaws, and not all amendments are correct,\" he contended as he emphasised the need for transparency. He specifically flagged concerns that the government might eliminate certain types of waqf properties.\n\nNizami added that there are thousands of ongoing legal cases on waqf properties, including dargahs and graveyards, and the government should clarify the provisions of the amendment bill.\n\nOn the other hand, Kashish Warsi, president of the Indian Sufi Foundation, supported the amendments, comparing the Waqf Amendment Bill to the Triple Talaq reform, which he said benefited women and protected homes.\n\nWarsi stated that the bill would safeguard waqf properties, prevent their misuse, and benefit those who actually need support.\n\nMaulana Yasoob Abbas, General Secretary of the All India Shia Personal Law Board, stated that the board would support the bill if it benefits the waqf boards.\n\nHowever, he opposed the proposed amendments, questioning the source and nature of these changes. He expressed concerns about corruption and land mafia involvement in waqf properties while also stressing the need for transparency in the proposed changes.\n\nBJP leader Danish Iqbal mentioned that until the bill's provisions are examined, it is difficult to comment. However, he assured that the government is working on changes to the Waqf Act to prevent the misuse of waqf properties. He highlighted that the Central government is focused on bringing transparency to waqf properties, including registering them on a public portal.\n\nKausar Jahan, Chairperson of the Delhi Hajj Committee, praised the proposed amendments as a transparent step by the government.

The reality is BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] has brought this bill for its few hardline supporters who are frustrated.\"\n\nCongress leader K C Venugopal slammed the bill saying it amounted to an attack on the Constitution. \"Waqf properties come from donations. It [bill] violates Article 26 of the Constitution [guaranteeing the right to form and maintain institutions for religious and charitable intents]. In this bill, they [the government] are putting a provision that non-Muslims can also be members of the governing council,\" Venugopal said.\n\nHe called the provision an attack on faith and freedom of religion. \"Now you are going after Muslims. Next, you will go after Christians and Jains. We believe in the culture and traditions of India. We are believers as Hindus but we also respect other religions,\" Venugopal said. He linked the bill to the polls in Maharashtra, Bihar, and Haryana. \"This bill is also an attack on the federal system.\"\n\nVenugopal maintained that the bill would trigger disputes over each mosque that does not have any deed. \"You want a communal clash between communities. In every bill, there has to be a motive for well-being. Now, you are ill motivated to divide people. This bill cannot be introduced, let alone be passed,\" said Venugopal.\n\nAIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi maintained that Parliament does not have the competence to make the proposed amendments. \"Waqf management is an essential religious practise of Muslims. The government is trying to severely restrict it. Hindus can give their properties but Muslims cannot give them to Allah. Who is going to decide if one is practising Islam for five years before he can donate his property [for waqf]?\" he asked, referring to one of the bill provisions.\n\nOwaisi said waqf properties are not public properties. \"This government wants to take over mosques, I am sure you want to make Bilkis Bano and Zakia Jafri Waqf members,\" he said, referring to the survivors of the 2002 Gujarat riots. Bano was three months pregnant when she was gang-raped during the riots while her three-year-old daughter was among seven of her relatives killed. Jafri's husband, Ehsan Jafri, a former Congress member of Parliament, was hacked to death and later burnt during the riots.\n\nSP leader Mobibbullah said Hindus manage their temples but the government wants people of other religions to be a part of waqf management. \"They are interfering in the religion. This will not help the nation. Minorities will not feel safe in the country.\"\n\nTrinamool Congress (TMC) floor leader Sudip Bandopadhyay maintained the bill violates Article 14 of the Constitution related to equality before the law. His party colleague, Kalyan Banerjee, said the bill is beyond the legislative competence of the central government and it is also against Constitutional morality. \"This bill is targeting the Muslims. Before [2024 national] election, there was an attempt to make the country a Hindu Rashtra, which has been rejected by the people.\"\n\nIndian Union Muslim League leader Md Bashir said if this bill is passed, the entire waqf system will collapse. \"...[the bill gives] all powers to the district collectors, who become superior to the Waqf Board chairman. This bill encourages encroachment of waqf land. Your [government] intention is to spoil communal amity.\"\n\nCommunist Party of India (Marxist)'s K Radhakrishnan said the government did not consult any state before bringing the bill. Revolutionary Socialist Party leader NK Premachandran said the bill will be rejected in legislative scrutiny. \"You should either withdraw the bill or send it to some committee.\"\n\nHarish Balayogi of Telugu Desam Party, a key BJP ally, supported the bill but maintained the purpose of the donors needs to be protected. He said the bill regulates and streamlines the purpose. \"The new law will help poor Muslims and Muslim women of the country. We have no problem if the bill is sent to a select committee", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Click Here to read. Share your views and suggestions in the comment box or at manas.srivastava@indianexpress.com\ud83d\udea8\n\nPreliminary Examination: Current events of national and international importance\n\nMains Examination: GS-III: Science and Technology\n\nWhat's the ongoing story- IN A heartbreaking twist of fate, wrestler Vinesh Phogat was disqualified from the 50-kg gold medal bout at the Paris Olympics after failing the weigh-in because she was 100 grams overweight. The Indian contingent later filed an appeal against her disqualification in the Court of Arbitration for Sport, with the demand that Phogat be awarded the silver medal.\n\n-- What is the recent controversy regarding Vinesh Phogat?\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n-- Combat sports -- wrestling, boxing, judo, mixed martial arts (MMA), etc. -- are organised according to weight classes. This is to facilitate fair and competitive matches. Fighters of similar weight (and thus, size) are more likely to have similar physical attributes, making for a more even playing field.\n\n-- Athletes in a particular weight class (say 50 kg) have to weigh equal to, or less than, the stipulated weight... Moreover, it is impractical to constantly monitor an athlete's weight throughout a competition... Thus, combat sports use a system of weigh-ins. There are designated times before (and in some competitions, after) when an athlete has to be weighed, and meet the requirements of their weight class.\n\n-- Since the Olympics competition goes on for two days, there are two weigh-ins -- there is a 30 minute period on Day 1, and a 15 minute period on Day 2.\n\n-- In simple words, weight cutting involves athletes drastically reducing their weight in a short period of time. This is done by athletes to make the stipulated weight in time for weigh-ins.\n\n-- This is because weight cuts primarily involve ridding the body of any accumulated water -- this is the \"easiest\" weight to shed. Athletes do not drink water, carry out intense exercise, use saunas, wear heavy clothing, etc. to lose this water weight through sweat.\n\n-- In the highest levels of sport, where a lot (including handsome monetary rewards) rides on an athlete's performance, there is an incentive to push the limits of what is safe -- sometimes with dangerous, even deadly, consequences.\n\n-- \"Severe (or even moderate) dehydration used for weight loss in weight restricted sports increases the risk of acute cardiovascular problems...\" researchers O R Barley, D W. Chapman, and Chris Abbiss wrote in 'The Current State of Weight-Cutting in Combat Sports', published in journal Sports (Basel) in 2019.\n\n-- This is why some experts have called for a ban on weight cutting. However, not everyone agrees, especially athletes. Many believe that it is possible to cut weight safely by following a strict, longer-term regime to do so.\n\n-- That said, critics argue that there is simply no scientific evidence to show that weight cutting can be done safely, and so-called \"safe strategies\" too may have an impact on an athlete's health years down the line.\n\n\"Gold medals aren't really made of Gold. they're made of sweat, determination, and a hard-to-find alloy called guts.\" -- Dan Gable\n\nPoints to Ponder:\n\n-- What is the impact of drastic weight reduction on athletic performance?\n\n-- What are the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) guidelines regarding this?\n\n-- What are the United World Wrestling (UWW) guidelines on weight-in?\n\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\n\nParis Olympics: Opaque rules forced Vinesh Phogat to compete in a category she struggled to cut weight for\n\nFrom non-Muslims on state boards to DC as arbiter: Sweeping changes in waqf Bill\n\nUPSC Syllabus:\n\nPreliminary Examination: Current events of national and international importance\n\nMains Examination: GS-II: Polity\n\nWhat's the ongoing story- From giving the government a big say in regulating waqf properties, redefining how a property is deemed to be in the possession of waqf to changing the composition of waqf boards in states, the Centre is set to bring in key amendments to overhaul the regulatory framework of Muslim charitable endowments.\n\n-- What are the constitutional provisions for freedom of religion?\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n-- The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, which seeks to amend the Waqf Act, 1995, proposes to allow even a non-Muslim Chief Executive Officer and at least two non-Muslim members to be appointed by the state government to the waqf boards at the state level.\n\n-- Among the key changes proposed is to bring the District Collector as the arbiter on whether a property is waqf property or government land.\n\n-- The Bill states that \"any government property identified or declared as waqf property, before or after the commencement of this Act, shall not be deemed to be a waqf property.\" However, the amendment states that the Collector will make this determination in case of a dispute and not the Waqf Tribunal. Currently, under the 1995 Act, this decision is made exclusively by the Waqf Tribunal.\n\n-- The amendments also seek to completely remove the concept of \"waqf by use\" which means that a property can be deemed to be a waqf through use even if the original declaration is suspect.\n\n-- The proposed Bill, if enacted, will give the Central government the power to \"direct the audit of any waqf at any time by an auditor appointed by the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India, or by any officer designated by the Central Government for that purpose\".\n\n-- In Islamic law, the dedication of a property as waqf was done largely orally until documentation became the standard norm. For example, even in the absence of a waqfnama, a masjid can be deemed to be waqf property if it is continuously used as such.\n\n-- Another key change in the Bill is introducing the concept of \"adverse possession\" with respect to waqfs.\n\n-- For the establishment and constitution of Central Waqf Council (which works for advising Central government, state governments and the waqf boards), the proposed Bill intends to give the power to the Centre to include three MPs (two from Lok Sabha and one from Rajya Sabha) without specifying that they have to be Muslim. In the original Act, the three MPs to be included in the Council had to be from the Muslim community.\n\n-- M R Shamshad writes: \"The concept of Waqf emanates from Islamic religious beliefs. It is not a religious obligation, but a form of religious charity.\"\n\n-- \"From a reading of the draft Waqf (Amendment) Bill, it would appear that the government has forgotten that Waqf properties are the private and self-acquired properties of the followers of Islam, except those which non-Muslims may have donated.\"\n\n-- \"They are not public properties, nor have they been acquired using public funds. In this background, the government must realise that its control over administration, management and further creation of new Waqfs has to be minimal.\"\n\n-- \"The proposed amendments seek to facilitate interference from \"government organisations\" in Waqf properties. This is not just an egregious violation of the rights of Muslim citizens but also of Article 26 of the Constitution, which protects the properties of religious denominations from take over.\"\n\n-- \"The amendments reflect the presumption that government land has been taken over by the Waqf Board. As mentioned earlier, the Collector makes the final decision in this regard and then directs the revenue authorities to give effect to his/her decision in the revenue record. By introducing the concept of adverse possession for Waqf properties, many could become victims to the Collector's notes on a file.\"\n\n-- \"This encroachment of rights by the government is clearly against the guarantees under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India... By bringing religion-centric legislation, governments have made Muslims of this country vulnerable to police excesses.\"\n\nPoints to Ponder:\n\n-- What are the criticisms of the proposed waqf bill?\n\n-- What was the need for introducing the Bill?\n\n-- How does Constitution protect the religious minorities?\n\n-- How does the Constitution provide for the freedom to manage religious affairs?\n\n(Thought Process: Right to Freedom of Religion has been provided in Article 25-28. Article 26 provides for the Freedom to manage religious affairs.)\n\n1. Article 25 provides the Right to propagate one's religion by extending the right to convert another person to one's own religion.\n\n2.

In a matter of moments, entire villages -- Mundakkai, Chooralmala, Attamala, and Noolpuzha -- were buried under massive debris. The toll is staggering: At least 300 lives have been lost, and countless more remain missing.\"\n\n-- Why did Britishers introduce rubber and tea plantations?\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n-- This a tragedy that exposes the terrible chasm in Indian society between the haves and the have-nots.\n\n-- This river of mud had left no trace of the eucalyptus plantations in its ruthless march, but one tree stood proud and erect on its route: It was Ficus beddomei, characteristic of the original vegetation.\n\n-- The economic interests of the British lay in rendering people resourceless, and dedicating forest tracts to tea and coffee plantations owned by their compatriots and growing timber for their military and construction needs.\n\n-- The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) took on board this historical background and painted a realistic picture of what was happening in India. The theme of our report was that any nation, including India, may be viewed as harbouring four capital stocks, namely, natural, social, human, and man-made capital.\n\n-- India is exclusively focused on building up highly subsidised man-made capital at serious costs to natural, human and social capitals, worsening economic, social, educational and health disparities and thereby depressing overall social welfare as well as the ability of our industrial enterprises to compete internationally.\n\n-- This is leading to increasing frequency and intensity of human interventions such as mines and quarries, roads, and buildings on hill slopes everywhere, including in ecologically highly sensitive regions.\n\n-- The only way to bring these unfortunate trends under check would be to follow the WGEEP's carefully drafted guidelines for regulation as well as the promotion of developmental activities graded with respect to zones with three different levels of ecological sensitivity -- high, moderate and low.\n\n-- Governments set the WGEEP's proposals aside since they have no interest in protecting nature and empowering people. This 13-year delay in acting on the WGEEP's suggestions is impacting the region more and more adversely, resulting in an increasing frequency of floods and landslides.\n\nFor Your Information:\n\n-- The Western Ghats have been classified as an ecologically fragile region. Recent research by experts at the Indian Institute of Science divided the 1.6 lakh sq km of Western Ghats into four ecologically sensitive regions (ESR). Promoting sustainable land-management practices such as reforestation, controlled deforestation, and sustainable agriculture is crucial to maintaining hillside stability and reducing soil erosion, thereby mitigating the effects of heavy rains.\n\n-- The Central government on Friday issued the sixth iteration of a draft notification, declaring 56,825.7 sq km of the Western Ghats an ecologically sensitive area (ESA) in the states of Gujarat,Maharashtra,Goa,Karnataka, Kerala andTamil Nadu.\n\n-- What is the impact of plantation agriculture on the topography of western ghats?\n\n-- Why western ghats are vulnerable to landslides?\n\n-- How far anthropogenic activities are responsible for landslides?\n\n(2) 'Gadgil Committee Report' and 'Kasturirangan Committee Report', sometimes seen in the news, are related to (UPSC CSE 2016)\n\nDifferentiate the causes of landslides in the Himalayan region and Western Ghats.

Through the UN, we have data on documented HPAWR (between 2009 and 2019) in 60 countries.....e might think this is an African problem. As the UN compilation shows, that perception isn't true. The intensity might be higher in Africa. But HPAWR exists in the USA and Europe, and even in India.\"\n\n-- \"Since 1953, NCRB (National Crime Records Bureau) has been a standard source of data on crime in India. That has a category on \"motives for murder\" and mentions witchcraft. In 2022, there were 85 such murders, concentrated in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Odisha. In addition, there are instances from Assam, Bihar and Telangana. The numbers may have declined a bit. But we are still at about 100 a year and these are just murders with witchcraft as a motive.\"\n\n-- \"The word \"witch\" is gender-neutral, etymologically, although there is a popular perception that the male of the species is wizard (wicca), while the female is a witch.\"\n\n-- In principle, witchcraft can be benevolent. But in perception and practice, it is dubbed malevolent. The roots are old. However, that dubbing as malevolent is used for crimes against women, not always leading to murder.\"\n\n-- \"As a less diabolical motive, there is a lack of education and ignorance, with mental health patients dubbed as witches, especially when there is disease in the neighbourhood.

Sheikh Hasina is in India after fleeing Bangladesh on Monday.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n-- What is the reason for the ongoing protest in Bangladesh?\n\n-- Public demonstrations and protests are hardly unusual in Bangladesh. A few weeks ago no one would have predicted that the student movement protesting quotas in government jobs would lead to the end of the road for Bangladesh's longest-serving prime minister.\n\n-- Hasina's response to these protests exposed her as a leader out of touch with the ordinary people, and the political sensibilities of the younger generation of Bangladeshis.\n\n-- The protests against quotas in government jobs for the children and grandchildren of those who fought in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War brought to light a level of economic disaffection that was sweeping the country's educated youth.\n\n-- Perhaps the most egregious example of the former prime minister's insensitivity was her criticism of the protests at a press conference on July 14. \"If the grandchildren of freedom fighters do not receive (quota) benefits,\" she asked \"who would get it? The grandchildren of Razakars?\" The term refers to the much-hated collaborators with the Pakistani army during the country's liberation war.\n\n-- Right now, the power vacuum is the most urgent issue facing Bangladesh. Since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government, attacks on police stations have made policemen fearful of doing routine policing.\n\n-- The political landscape of Bangladesh is considerably more complex than the binary of the secularists and the Islamists. It is too early to say how the future politics of the country unfolds. But right now, one can say that neither the student protests nor the initial moves to forming the interim government point towards the return of Islamists to power.\n\n-- For the past fifteen years India had put most of its eggs in the Awami League basket. While the relationship between the two countries has improved significantly during the Awami League regime, there is a widespread perception in Bangladesh that the relationship has brought more benefit to India than to Bangladesh.\n\n-- Given the unexpected nature of the political change in Bangladesh, India's foreign policy establishment will now need to carefully navigate the fluid new political environment in the country. There is no reason to fear that there will be dramatic shifts in Bangladesh's foreign policy of the kind that would go against Indian interests.\n\nFor Your Information:\n\n-- In trade terms, Bangladesh is India's biggest partner in the subcontinent, and India is Bangladesh's second biggest partner in Asia after China. Their total bilateral trade amounted to $13 billion in the financial year 2023-24, according to the Union Ministry of Commerce.\n\n-- Infrastructure and connectivity has been a growing part of India-Bangladesh ties, according to the Minister of External Affairs. India has extended three lines of credit to Bangladesh since 2016 amounting to $8 billion for the development of road, rail, shipping and port infrastructure. In November 2023, two joint projects - the Akhaura-Agartala cross-border rail link and Khulna-Mongla Port rail line - were inaugurated.\n\nPoints to Ponder:\n\n-- What is the status of the India-Bangladesh relationship?\n\n-- What is India's foreign policy towards Bangladesh?\n\n-- What necessary measures have been taken by India to ensure border and diaspora protection?\n\n(4) With reference to river Teesta, consider the following statements: (UPSC CSE 2017)\n\n1.

Not every wildfire leads to the creation of pyrocumulonimbus clouds. They occur only when there is an extremely hot wildfire -- volcanic eruptions can also lead to the formation of pyrocumulonimbus clouds.\n\n-- The intense heat from the fire warms the surrounding air which moves upward into the atmosphere. As this hot and very buoyant air -- carrying water vapour, smoke, and ash -- rises, it expands and cools down. Once it is cool enough, water vapour condenses on ash, forming a grey or brown cloud. At this stage, the cloud is known as a pyrocumulus cloud, also known as 'fire cloud'.\n\n-- But if there is sufficient water vapour available and the upward movement of hot air intensifies, pyrocumulus clouds can evolve into a pyrocumulonimbus cloud. These clouds can reach heights of 50,000 feet and generate their own systems of thunderstorms.\n\n-- Although pyrocumulonimbus clouds can produce lighting, they do not generate much rain. As a result, they can spark new wildfires many kilometres away from the main blaze. These clouds can also trigger strong winds that can make the spread of the wildfire faster and unpredictable.\n\n-- The exact reason for the frequent pyrocumulonimbus cloud events remains unclear as unlike in the case of other extreme weather events, the study of these clouds is relatively new. However, scientists believe that climate change could have a role to play in the increase of their frequency.\n\n-- How does climate change lead to extreme weather events?\n\n-- How far Anthropogenic activities are responsible for forest fires?\n\n1. High clouds primarily reflect solar radiation and cool the surface of the Earth.\n\n2. Low clouds have a high absorption of infrared radiation emanating from the Earth's surface and thus cause warming effect.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?", "source": {"uri":

The Bill, introduced by Union Minister Kiren Rijiju, aims for transparency and inclusivity in the waqf system, proposing broad-based representation and streamlined registration processes.\n\nFormer minister for minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Thursday hailed the introduction of The Waqf (Amendment) Bill and said it will pave the way for 'constitutional hierarchy' over 'unconstitutional anarchy'.\n\nThe BJP leader described the Bill as a positive and constructive step towards a logical solution to a long-pending problem, emphasizing the necessity for religious and temporal alignment.\n\nCriticizing the opposition, Naqvi urged those creating 'communal confusion' to refrain from spreading fear and imposing a 'Talibani lock on an inclusive reform'. He argued that the waqf system should move beyond its 'touch me not' syndrome, which, supported by a 'communal caucus', has made the system hostage to narrow-minded self-interests.\n\nUnion Minority Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju introduced The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, proposing it be sent to a joint parliamentary committee after opposition objections.\n\nThe Bill seeks to rename the Act to the Unified Waqf Management, Empowerment, Efficiency and Development Act, 1995, and proposes changes including the omission of Section 40 regarding waqf property determination, broad-based composition of councils, and new boards for Boharas and Aghakhanis. It also aims to streamline waqf registrations through a central database and detailed mutation procedures.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukhtar_Abbas_Naqvi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waqf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Waqf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union Council of Ministers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiren_Rijiju", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kiren Rijiju"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Lobbying", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Lobbying", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/08_08_2024_13_35_03_6220871.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801291", "eventUri": "eng-9801291", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The same note informs us that this makes waqf boards the third largest landowners in India after the armed forces and Indian Railways.\n\nThe Waqf Act was comprehensively amended in 2013, based on the recommendations of a high-level committee under the chairmanship of justice (retd) Rajinder Sachar, the report of a joint parliamentary committee on waqf, and the Central Waqf Council, and after detailed consultation with other stakeholders.\n\nHowever, this did not put an end to disputes, contentious claims and allegations of irregularities, which the Union government has now made a pretext to steamroll a new law by amending as many as 44 sections of the Waqf Act 1995.\n\nMost Muslims are outraged and point out that the new law amounts to interference in the community's affairs and also a blatant attempt to dispossess the largest minority of the wealth meant for the socio-economic uplift of the community.\n\n\"To make the inclusion of non-Muslims in waqf boards is questionable,\" said Jamaat-e-Islami Hind president Sadatullah Hussaini.

It is a grave attack on the basic structure of the Constitution as it violates the principles of judicial independence and separation of powers,\" he said.\n\nThe All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president added that the management of waqf was an essential religious practice of Muslims. A denial of legal recognition of Waqf-Alal-Aulaad, a private waqf, and Waqf-by-User, Mr. Owaisi said, was a severe restriction of how Muslims can manage their properties. On the contrary, Hindu endowment boards are recognised by usage and customs, he said.\n\nMr. Owaisi said that while a Hindu could give his entire property to his son or daughter as a gift, a Muslim could not do so in the name of Allah. \"You are stopping me from praying. You are restraining Waqf-Alal-Aulaad, which is not only discriminatory, [but also] violative of Article 25,\" he said.\n\n\"Waqf properties are not public properties.

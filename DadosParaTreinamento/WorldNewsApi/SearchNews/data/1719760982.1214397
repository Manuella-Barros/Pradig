Combining Subaru\u2019s renowned Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive with a revised drivetrain, standard X-MODE, elevated 9.3-inch ground clearance and exclusive body cladding, the 2024 Crosstrek Wilderness is rugged and trail-capable, as it should be. 2024 Subary Crosstrek Wilderness Subaru It doesn\u2019t have the best get-up-and-go, but some will be ok with that and it\u2019s therefore good for the conservative and careful or new or inexperienced drivers. Subaru also says 96% of Subaru Crosstrek vehicles sold in the last 10 years are still on the road today, a great endorsement especially for a ride you expect to slam around, at least a little. It starts at a relatively inexpensive $31,995, another plus. Looks It\u2019s about as Subaru-y as you can get, with my tester covered in trim- specific orange accents on the roof rack and elsewhere and its big logo on each door and the rear gate. You\u2019ve got a body-color roof spoiler and black side mirrors with integrated turn signals. It also features a versatile ladder-type roof rack system with a 165-lb. dynamic load capacity and a 700-lb. static load limit, allowing safe use of larger roof-top tents. The roof rail design provides flexibility to fit a wide variety of carrying accessories, including Genuine Subaru Accessories available from Subaru retailers if you go that route. 2024 Subaru Crosstrek Wilderness Subaru MORE FOR YOU Trump Trial Prosecutor Ends Closing Argument After Nearly 5 Hours\u2014Jury Instructions Set For Wednesday Gas Explosion In Downtown Youngstown Ohio Injures At Least 7 Trump Lashes Out At Robert De Niro After Actor Calls Him A Tyrant Outside Courthouse An available option package for Wilderness includes Power Moonroof; 10-way power driver seat with 2-way lumbar support and a Harman Kardon\u00ae 10-speaker system with 432-watt equivalent amplifier for an MSRP of $2,270. It\u2019s attractive \u2013 for a Subaru \u2013 and you\u2019ll have no trouble finding it in parking lots. Inside Your seats are upholstered in comfortable, water-resistant Subaru StarTex material displaying Subaru\u2019s Wilderness logo embossed in the front headrests. Copper colored contrast stitching accents the interior, complementing the anodized copper-finish accents on the shifter (had to Google \u201canodized\u201d) gauge meter rings and leather-wrapped steering wheel. The driver is greeted with a Wilderness logo appearing in the meter display at start-up. So far, so good. Standard all-weather floor mats feature a outdoorsy Wilderness design. In the cargo area, a removable water-resistant rear cargo tray protects the load floor from wet, muddy gear tossed in the back. The rear gate comes equipped with an LED light for better nighttime visibility. 2024 Subaru Crosstrek Wilderness Subaru Engine You\u2019re powered by a 2.5-liter direct-injection SUBARU BOXER engine, making a feeble 182 hp and 178 lb-ft of torque. You\u2019ve got a revised differential gear ratio and retuned Lineartronic CVT which will improve the SUV\u2019s climbing ability, and the new tuning for the CVT optimizes traction at low speeds and on slippery surfaces. Additionally, maximum towing capacity more than doubles to 3,500 lb. thanks to the addition of a transmission oil cooler. Tech An 11.6 inch screen dominates the cockpit, but I found it easy to use and its icons attractive. Despite my tester arriving with a Harman Kardon 10-speaker system with 432-watt equivalent amplifier, I found the sound substandard no matter if I was listening to commercial radio or by syncing playlists from my phone. The sound in my tester was muffled and un-punchy. 2024 Subaru Crosstrek Wilderness Subaru The drive My weeklong drive took me into New York City and in and around the streets and highways of Yonkers, with as many as 5 full-sized passengers. For my purposes, there wasn\u2019t a thing wrong with any of these journeys except I found the acceleration feeble. I happened to get into my buddy\u2019s 2012 Impreza during my Crosstrek test, and took off like a shot everywhere I went. It meant getting back into the Crosstrek ever-so-much of a bummer. It doesn\u2019t have a lot of power, end of story. A standard shift would be ideal. I did not find the brakes in any way peculiar or hard to get used to as some others have reported. The vehicle did what was asked of it in its own time and I found a pleasant, unremarkable driving experience. That\u2019s not necessarily a \u201cbad\u201d thing, as I pointed out at the start of this article. It just meant than when the car went back, I had no particular memory of its drive within just a couple of days. 2024 Subaru Crosstrek Wilderness Subaru Safety equipment Like all 2024 Crosstrek models, the Wilderness is equipped with the brand\u2019s award-winning EyeSight\u00ae Driver Assist Technology, which includes Advanced Adaptive Cruise Control; Pre-Collision Braking; Pre-Collision Throttle Management; Lane Departure and Sway Warning, and Lead Vehicle Start Alert. In addition, Blind-Spot Detection with Lane Change Assist and Rear Cross-Traffic Alert are standard on the new model. The Crosstrek Wilderness also comes standard with Automatic Emergency Steering. The feature works in conjunction with EyeSight and Blind-Spot Detection to assist with steering control to help avoid a collision at speeds less than 50 mph. Standard Reverse Automatic Braking adds an extra measure of safety in tight trail situations and while parking. More About Its Off-Road Capability Usually I let readers investigate all the off-road charms of a vehicle by directing them to the manufacturer\u2019s website, but the more I read about what Subaru has done to make this the best off-roader it can be this side of a Wrangler or similar, the more impressed I was, so here goes. Exclusive suspension components give the 2024 Crosstrek Wilderness 9.3-inch ground clearance, more than a half-inch increase over the other Crosstrek models, which already were among the highest in their segment. Longer coil springs and shock absorbers provide the added ground clearance, while special tuning helps maintain dynamic performance. Longer travel strokes for the front and rear shock absorbers help keep the tires in contact with rough surfaces, and increasing stability.The Crosstrek Wilderness also comes equipped with Yokohama GEOLANDAR\u00ae all-terrain tires for optimal performance in mud, gravel or snow. Mounted on exclusive 17-inch alloy wheels in matte-black finish, the tires are embossed with raised white letters. X-MODE for Maximum Control Snow / Dirt and Deep Snow / Mud modes are all on deck to assist \u2013 but no Sport. To help maximize traction in varying conditions, each mode specifically optimizes the engine output and CVT ratio positions, increases the Active All-Wheel Drive engagement and enhances the control logic of the Vehicle Dynamics Control with Traction Control System. The X-MODE display features a Roll-Angle Indicator to help the driver judge potentially hazardous situations. 2024 Subaru Crosstrek Wilderness Subaru This technology also helps make Crosstrek Wilderness a nimble climber. When the X-MODE system is activated, Low Speed / Low Ratio Gradient Control is automatically put on standby to sense when the vehicle is traveling on a steep incline at low speed. When it does, the system shifts the CVT to its lowest ratio (4.066:1). Combined with the Wilderness model\u2019s lower differential ratios, the system also enhances rough off-pavement, low-speed drivability over rocks and other situations that require repeated on/off accelerator usage. Standard Hill Descent Control will automatically engage individual wheel braking control on downgrades when the vehicle is driven under 12 mph with the accelerator pedal pressed less than about 10 percent. Active Torque Vectoring, standard on all 2024 Crosstrek models, enhances handling stability on road or trail. Conclusion: The 2024 Subaru Crosstrek Wilderness is functional and attractive, it can hold a lot of stuff and it\u2019s on the lower end of the spectrum sticker-wise. It\u2019s a good choice for fans of the brand. It just doesn\u2019t go very fast. Follow me on LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here.

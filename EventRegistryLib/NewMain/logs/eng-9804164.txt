Krohn, W&T's Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"We remain committed to executing our strategic vision focused on free cash flow generation, maintaining solid production and maximizing margins while increasing proved reserves and PV-10. This commitment enabled W&T to deliver another quarter of solid results where production was at the midpoint of our guidance range, LOE was below the bottom end of our guidance range and more importantly, we increased our cash on hand by 30% while decreasing net debt by 9% compared to March 31, 2024. We generated strong Adjusted EBITDA of $45.9 million during the second quarter and our focus on quality free cash flow generation resulted in W&T reporting $18.7 million in Free Cash Flow, the 26th consecutive quarter of positive Free Cash Flow. We continue to make progress integrating our 2024 acquired assets into W&T, and we now have four of the six fields online, but we still have more work to do that should help to increase production from the new fields.\"\n\n\"Our 2024 mid-year reserve report generated by NSAI shows a meaningful increase in reserves and PV-10 value, which demonstrates the resiliency and strength of our asset base. Our improved balance sheet enables us to continue to grow both organically and through targeted, complementary acquisitions in the Gulf of Mexico that allow us to leverage our scale and expertise in the basin. We are well positioned to capture and enhance value, while returning capital to our shareholders through the quarterly dividend program. Our proven and successful strategy and operational excellence should help us to continue to produce strong results both operationally and financially for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025.\"\n\nProduction, Prices and Revenue: Production for the second quarter of 2024 was 34.9 MBoe/d, at the midpoint of the Company's second quarter guidance and virtually flat compared with 35.1 MBoe/d for the first quarter of 2024 and 37.0 MBoe/d for the corresponding period in 2023. Second quarter 2024 production was comprised of 15.2 thousand barrels per day (\"MBbl/d\") of oil (44%), 3.7 MBbl/d of natural gas liquids (\"NGLs\") (11%), and 96.4 million cubic feet per day (\"MMcf/d\") of natural gas (45%). Production in the second quarter of 2024 was negatively impacted by the Company's primary Mobile Bay processing plant getting shut-in by the third-party operator to perform a turnaround. This forced W&T to re-route Mobile Bay volumes to a separate third-party processing plant that did not have the same capacity, leading to curtailed production and sales. These decreases were partially offset by increased production from wells acquired in both January 2024 and September 2023. The primary processing plant was back online in June 2024 and is now processing the Company's Mobile Bay volumes at its existing capacity. Regarding W&T's acquisition of assets in January 2024:\n\nW&T's average realized price per Boe before realized derivative settlements was $44.40 per Boe in the second quarter of 2024, an increase of 4% from $42.55 per Boe in the first quarter of 2024 and an increase of 21% from $36.76 per Boe in the second quarter of 2023. Second quarter 2024 oil, NGL and natural gas prices before realized derivative settlements were $80.29 per barrel, $24.43 per barrel, and $2.50 per Mcf, respectively.\n\nRevenues for the second quarter of 2024 were $142.8 million, which was approximately 1% higher than first quarter of 2024 revenue of $140.8 million due to modestly higher realized prices partially offset by lower production volumes. Second quarter 2024 revenue was approximately 13% higher than $126.2 million of revenue in the second quarter of 2023 due to higher average realized prices, partially offset by moderately lower natural gas and NGL production volumes.\n\nLease Operating Expense: LOE, which includes base lease operating expenses, insurance premiums, workovers and facilities maintenance expenses, was $74.0 million in the second quarter of 2024, which was below the bottom end of the previously provided guidance range. LOE came in lower than expected as the Company continued to realize synergies from asset acquisitions in late 2023 and early 2024. LOE for the second quarter of 2024 was approximately 4% higher compared to $70.8 million in the first quarter of 2024 and up approximately 12% from $66.0 million for the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to higher base lease operating expenses related to the asset acquisitions in late 2023 and early 2024. On a component basis for the second quarter of 2024, base LOE and insurance premiums were $57.0 million, workovers were $2.4 million, and facilities maintenance and other expenses were $14.6 million. On a unit of production basis, LOE was $23.29 per Boe in the second quarter of 2024. This compares to $22.14 per Boe for the first quarter of 2024 and $19.60 per Boe for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nGathering, Transportation Costs and Production Taxes: Gathering, transportation costs and production taxes totaled $8.6 million ($2.70 per Boe) in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $7.5 million ($2.36 per Boe) in the first quarter of 2024 and $6.8 million ($2.02 per Boe) in the second quarter of 2023. Gathering, transportation costs and production taxes increased primarily due to higher processing fees for W&T's Mobile Bay production that had to be re-routed to a different processing plant.\n\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization (\"DD&A\"): DD&A was $11.55 per Boe in the second quarter of 2024. This compares to $10.61 per Boe and $8.37 per Boe for the first quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2023, respectively.\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations Accretion: Asset retirement obligations accretion was $2.64 per Boe in the second quarter of 2024. This compares to $2.49 per Boe and $2.29 per Boe for the first quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2023, respectively.\n\nGeneral & Administrative Expenses (\"G&A\"): G&A was $21.4 million for the second quarter of 2024, which increased from $20.5 million in the first quarter of 2024, and from $17.4 million in the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to non-recurring professional and legal services. On a unit of production basis, G&A was $6.72 per Boe in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $6.41 per Boe in the first quarter of 2024 and $5.16 per Boe in the corresponding period of 2023. G&A in the second quarter of 2024 included $1.4 million of non-cash compensation expense compared with $3.0 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $2.1 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nDerivative Loss (Gain), net: In the second quarter of 2024, W&T recorded a net loss of $2.4 million related to commodity derivative contracts comprised of a $2.7 million unrealized loss related to the decrease in fair value of open contracts and $0.3 million of realized gains. W&T recognized a net gain of $4.9 million in the first quarter of 2024 and a net gain of $0.8 million in the second quarter of 2023 related to commodity derivative activities.\n\nA summary of the Company's outstanding derivative positions is provided in the investor presentation posted on W&T's website.\n\nInterest Expense: Net interest expense in the second quarter of 2024 was $10.2 million compared to $10.1 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $10.3 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nOther Expense: During 2021 and 2022, as a result of the declaration of bankruptcy by a third party that is the indirect successor in title to certain offshore interests that were previously divested by the Company, W&T recorded a contingent loss accrual related to anticipated non-ARO plugging and abandonment costs. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company reassessed its existing obligations and recorded an additional $1.7 million.\n\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense: W&T recognized an income tax benefit of $4.6 million in the second quarter of 2024. This compares to the recognition of income tax expense of $1.0 million and $3.0 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively.\n\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity: As of June 30, 2024, W&T had available liquidity of $173.4 million comprised of $123.4 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $50.0 million of borrowing availability under W&T's first priority secured revolving facility provided by Calculus Lending LLC. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had total debt of $391.9 million and Net Debt of $268.5 million. Of W&T's total debt of $391.9 million, only $280.2 million is recourse to W&T. The remaining $111.7 million is held at W&T's wholly owned subsidiary, Aquasition Energy LLC, and is non-recourse to W&T. As of June 30, 2024, Net Debt to TTM Adjusted EBITDA was 1.4x.\n\nCapital Expenditures: Capital expenditures on an accrual basis (excluding acquisitions) in the second quarter of 2024 were $8.8 million, and asset retirement settlement costs totaled $8.2 million. For the first six months ended June 30, 2024, capital expenditures on an accrual basis (excluding acquisitions) totaled $11.9 million and asset retirements costs were $12.0 million. Investments related to acquisitions in the six months ended June 30, 2024 totaled $80.6 million, which included $77.3 million for the Cox acquisition and $3.3 million of final purchase price adjustments related to W&T's acquisition of properties in September 2023.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company performed three workovers and two recompletions that positively impacted production for the quarter. W&T plans to continue performing these low cost, short payout operations that impact both production and revenue.\n\nCash Dividend Policy\n\nThe Company paid its second quarter 2024 dividend of $0.01 per share on May 31, 2024 to stockholders of record on May 24, 2024.\n\nThe Board of Directors declared a third quarter 2024 dividend of $0.01 per share which is to be paid on August 27, 2024 to stockholders of record on August 20, 2024.\n\nMid-Year 2024 Proved Reserves\n\nAs calculated by NSAI, W&T's independent reserve engineering consultants, proved reserves using SEC pricing methodology totaled 141.9 MMBoe at June 30, 2024, compared with 123.0 MMBoe at year-end 2023. The increase in proved reserves was primarily driven by acquisition additions of 21.8 MMBoe and positive revisions of 3.5 MMBoe, partially offset by 6.3 MMBoe of production in the first half of 2024. The mid-year proved reserves, which were 54% proved developed producing, 29% proved developed non-producing, and 17% proved undeveloped, were 47% liquids (38% oil and 9% NGLs) and 53% natural gas. W&T operates approximately 94% of its mid-year 2024 proved reserves.\n\nThe pre-tax PV-10 of the mid-year 2024 proved reserves using SEC pricing was $1.4 billion (before consideration of expenditures for asset retirement obligations), an increase of 28% compared with the PV-10 of $1.1 billion at year-end 2023 using SEC pricing. The increase was primarily driven by the six additional fields acquired in January 2024. Mid-year 2024 SEC proved reserves and PV-10 were based on an average 12-month oil and natural gas prices of $79.45 per barrel and $2.32 per MMBtu, respectively. Prices used to determine proved reserves and PV-10 for year-end 2023 were $78.21 per barrel of oil and $2.64 per MMBtu of natural gas.\n\nThird Quarter and Full Year 2024 Production and Expense Guidance\n\nThe guidance for the third quarter and full year 2024 in the table below represents the Company's current expectations. Please refer to the section entitled \"Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\" below for risk factors that could impact guidance. Third quarter and full year 2024 guidance reflects the impact of third-party pipeline issues due to the Cox bankruptcy.\n\nW&T plans to spend more on LOE in the third quarter of 2024 to undertake some of the projects deferred earlier in the year. However, full year estimated LOE was reduced to a range of $280 million to $315 million, or about 5% at the mid-point, to take into account W&T's ability to lower costs and the benefit of synergies from recent acquisitions.\n\nW&T expects substantially all taxes in 2024 to be deferred.\n\nConference Call Information: W&T will hold a conference call to discuss its financial and operational results on Wednesday, August 7, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. Central Time (10:00 a.m. Eastern Time). Interested parties may dial 1-844-739-3797. International parties may dial 1-412-317-5713. Participants should request to connect to the \"W&T Offshore Conference Call.\" This call will also be webcast and available on W&T's website at www.wtoffshore.com under \"Investors.\" An audio replay will be available on the Company's website following the call.\n\nAbout W&T Offshore\n\nW&T Offshore, Inc. is an independent oil and natural gas producer with operations offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and has grown through acquisitions, exploration and development.

For more information on W&T, please visit the Company's website at www.wtoffshore.com.\n\nForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this release regarding the Company's financial position, operating and financial performance, business strategy, plans and objectives of management for future operations, projected costs, industry conditions, potential acquisitions, the impact of and integration of acquired assets, and indebtedness are forward-looking statements. When used in this release, forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by terms or phrases such as \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"predict,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"continue,\" \"anticipate,\" \"target,\" \"could,\" \"plan,\" \"intend,\" \"seek,\" \"goal,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"may\" or other words and similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. Items contemplating or making assumptions about actual or potential future production and sales, prices, market size, and trends or operating results also constitute such forward-looking statements.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations and assumptions about future events and speak only as of the date of this release. While management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the Company's control. Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, as results actually achieved may differ materially from expected results described in these statements. The Company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims, any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements, unless required by law.\n\nForward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially including, among other things, the regulatory environment, including availability or timing of, and conditions imposed on, obtaining and/or maintaining permits and approvals, including those necessary for drilling and/or development projects; the impact of current, pending and/or future laws and regulations, and of legislative and regulatory changes and other government activities, including those related to permitting, drilling, completion, well stimulation, operation, maintenance or abandonment of wells or facilities, managing energy, water, land, greenhouse gases or other emissions, protection of health, safety and the environment, or transportation, marketing and sale of the Company's products; inflation levels; global economic trends, geopolitical risks and general economic and industry conditions, such as the global supply chain disruptions and the government interventions into the financial markets and economy in response to inflation levels and world health events; volatility of oil, NGL and natural gas prices; the global energy future, including the factors and trends that are expected to shape it, such as concerns about climate change and other air quality issues, the transition to a low-emission economy and the expected role of different energy sources; supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs, including due to the actions of foreign producers, importantly including OPEC and other major oil producing companies (\"OPEC+\") and change in OPEC+'s production levels; disruptions to, capacity constraints in, or other limitations on the pipeline systems that deliver the Company's oil and natural gas and other processing and transportation considerations; inability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to obtain adequate financing to fund capital expenditures, meet the Company's working capital requirements or fund planned investments; price fluctuations and availability of natural gas and electricity; the Company's ability to use derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk; the Company's ability to meet the Company's planned drilling schedule, including due to the Company's ability to obtain permits on a timely basis or at all, and to successfully drill wells that produce oil and natural gas in commercially viable quantities; uncertainties associated with estimating proved reserves and related future cash flows; the Company's ability to replace the Company's reserves through exploration and development activities; drilling and production results, lower-than-expected production, reserves or resources from development projects or higher-than-expected decline rates; the Company's ability to obtain timely and available drilling and completion equipment and crew availability and access to necessary resources for drilling, completing and operating wells; changes in tax laws; effects of competition; uncertainties and liabilities associated with acquired and divested assets; the Company's ability to make acquisitions and successfully integrate any acquired businesses; asset impairments from commodity price declines; large or multiple customer defaults on contractual obligations, including defaults resulting from actual or potential insolvencies; geographical concentration of the Company's operations; the creditworthiness and performance of the Company's counterparties with respect to its hedges; impact of derivatives legislation affecting the Company's ability to hedge; failure of risk management and ineffectiveness of internal controls; catastrophic events, including tropical storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics and other world health events; environmental risks and liabilities under U.S. federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations (including remedial actions); potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; the Company's ability to recruit and/or retain key members of the Company's senior management and key technical employees; information technology failures or cyberattacks; and governmental actions and political conditions, as well as the actions by other third parties that are beyond the Company's control, and other factors discussed in W&T Offshore's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q found at www.sec.gov or at the Company's website at www.wtoffshore.com under the Investor Relations section.\n\n(1) MBoe is determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil, condensate or NGLs (totals may not compute due to rounding). The conversion ratio does not assume price equivalency and the price on an equivalent basis for oil, NGLs and natural gas may differ significantly. The realized prices presented above are volume-weighted for production in the respective period.\n\nCertain financial information included in W&T's financial results are not measures of financial performance recognized by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are \"Net Debt,\" \"Adjusted Net Loss,\" \"Adjusted EBITDA,\" \"Free Cash Flow\" and PV-10 or are derivable from a combination of these measures. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of performance. These disclosures may not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures which may be reported by other companies. Prior period amounts have been conformed to the methodology and presentation of the current period.\n\nWe calculate Net Debt as total debt (current and long-term portions), less cash and cash equivalents. Management uses Net Debt to evaluate the Company's financial position, including its ability to service its debt obligations.\n\nReconciliation of Net (Loss) Income to Adjusted Net Loss\n\nAdjusted Net Loss adjusts for certain items that the Company believes affect comparability of operating results, including items that are generally non-recurring in nature or whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. These items include unrealized commodity derivative gain, net, allowance for credit losses, write-off of debt issuance costs, non-recurring legal and IT-related costs, non-ARO plugging and abandonment costs, and other which are then tax effected using the Federal Statutory Rate.\n\nSelected items were tax effected with the Federal Statutory Rate of 21% for each respective period.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA/ Free Cash Flow Reconciliations\n\nThe Company also presents non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income plus net interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization, ARO accretion, excluding the unrealized commodity derivative loss (gain), allowance for credit losses, non-cash incentive compensation, non-recurring legal and IT-related costs, non-ARO plugging and abandonment costs, and other. Company management believes this presentation is relevant and useful because it helps investors understand W&T's operating performance and makes it easier to compare its results with those of other companies that have different financing, capital and tax structures. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for net income, as an indication of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA, as W&T calculates it, may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA measures reported by other companies. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not represent funds available for discretionary use.\n\nThe Company defines Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA (defined above), less capital expenditures, plugging and abandonment costs and net interest expense (all on an accrual basis). For this purpose, the Company's definition of capital expenditures includes costs incurred related to oil and natural gas properties (such as drilling and infrastructure costs and the lease maintenance costs) and equipment but excludes acquisition costs of oil and gas properties from third parties that are not included in the Company's capital expenditures guidance provided to investors. Company management believes that Free Cash Flow is an important financial performance measure for use in evaluating the performance and efficiency of its current operating activities after the impact of accrued capital expenditures, plugging and abandonment costs and net interest expense and without being impacted by items such as changes associated with working capital, which can vary substantially from one period to another. There is no commonly accepted definition of Free Cash Flow within the industry. Accordingly, Free Cash Flow, as defined and calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to Free Cash Flow or other similarly named non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. While the Company includes net interest expense in the calculation of Free Cash Flow, other mandatory debt service requirements of future payments of principal at maturity (if such debt is not refinanced) are excluded from the calculation of Free Cash Flow. These and other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from Free Cash Flow would reduce cash available for other uses.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the Company's net (loss) income, a GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, as such terms are defined by the Company:\n\nA reconciliation of the adjustment used to calculate Free Cash Flow to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements is included below:\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of cash flow from operating activities, a GAAP measure, to Free Cash Flow, as defined by the Company:\n\nA reconciliation of the adjustments used to calculate Free Cash Flow to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements is included below:\n\nThe Company also discloses PV-10, which is not a financial measure defined under GAAP. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for proved reserves calculated using SEC pricing. Company management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of PV-10 is relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 is also used internally when assessing the potential return on investment related to oil and natural gas properties and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. Company management believes that the use of PV-10 is valuable because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid. Additionally, Company management believes that the presentation of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor is it intended to represent the current market value of the Company's estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP. Investors should not assume that PV-10 of the Company's proved oil and natural gas reserves represents a current market value of the Company's estimated oil and natural gas reserves. With respect to PV-10 calculated as of an interim date (i.e., other than year-end), it is not practical for the Company to reconcile the PV-10 of its SEC pricing proved reserves as of June 30, 2024 because GAAP does not provide for disclosure of standardized measure on an interim basis.", "source": {"uri": "wallstreet-online.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "wallstreet:online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boe_Constituency", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boe Constituency"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derivative (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_well", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oil well"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Acre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest,_taxes,_depreciation,_and_amortization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barrel (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factors_of_production", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Factors of production"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_expense", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Operating expense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-gas_condensate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural-gas condensate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/globenewswire-1280.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804164", "eventUri": "eng-9804164", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-08-", "textStart": 10334, "textEnd": 10343}], "sentiment": 0.6470588235294117, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

(NYSE: WTI) (\"W&T\" or the \"Company\") today reported operational and financial results for the second quarter of 2024 and declared a third quarter 2024 dividend of $0.01 per share.\n\nThis press release includes non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Net Debt and PV-10, which are described and reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measures below in the accompanying tables under \"Non-GAAP Information.\"\n\nKey highlights for the second quarter of 2024 and through the date of this press release include:\n\nTracy W. Krohn, W&T's Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"We remain committed to executing our strategic vision focused on free cash flow generation, maintaining solid production and maximizing margins while increasing proved reserves and PV-10. This commitment enabled W&T to deliver another quarter of solid results where production was at the midpoint of our guidance range, LOE was below the bottom end of our guidance range and more importantly, we increased our cash on hand by 30% while decreasing net debt by 9% compared to March 31, 2024. We generated strong Adjusted EBITDA of $45.9 million during the second quarter and our focus on quality free cash flow generation resulted in W&T reporting $18.7 million in Free Cash Flow, the 26th consecutive quarter of positive Free Cash Flow. We continue to make progress integrating our 2024 acquired assets into W&T, and we now have four of the six fields online, but we still have more work to do that should help to increase production from the new fields.\"\n\n\"Our 2024 mid-year reserve report generated by NSAI shows a meaningful increase in reserves and PV-10 value, which demonstrates the resiliency and strength of our asset base. Our improved balance sheet enables us to continue to grow both organically and through targeted, complementary acquisitions in the Gulf of Mexico that allow us to leverage our scale and expertise in the basin. We are well positioned to capture and enhance value, while returning capital to our shareholders through the quarterly dividend program. Our proven and successful strategy and operational excellence should help us to continue to produce strong results both operationally and financially for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025.\"\n\nProduction, Prices and Revenue: Production for the second quarter of 2024 was 34.9 MBoe/d, at the midpoint of the Company's second quarter guidance and virtually flat compared with 35.1 MBoe/d for the first quarter of 2024 and 37.0 MBoe/d for the corresponding period in 2023. Second quarter 2024 production was comprised of 15.2 thousand barrels per day (\"MBbl/d\") of oil (44%), 3.7 MBbl/d of natural gas liquids (\"NGLs\") (11%), and 96.4 million cubic feet per day (\"MMcf/d\") of natural gas (45%). Production in the second quarter of 2024 was negatively impacted by the Company's primary Mobile Bay processing plant getting shut-in by the third-party operator to perform a turnaround. This forced W&T to re-route Mobile Bay volumes to a separate third-party processing plant that did not have the same capacity, leading to curtailed production and sales. These decreases were partially offset by increased production from wells acquired in both January 2024 and September 2023. The primary processing plant was back online in June 2024 and is now processing the Company's Mobile Bay volumes at its existing capacity. Regarding W&T's acquisition of assets in January 2024:\n\nW&T's average realized price per Boe before realized derivative settlements was $44.40 per Boe in the second quarter of 2024, an increase of 4% from $42.55 per Boe in the first quarter of 2024 and an increase of 21% from $36.76 per Boe in the second quarter of 2023. Second quarter 2024 oil, NGL and natural gas prices before realized derivative settlements were $80.29 per barrel, $24.43 per barrel, and $2.50 per Mcf, respectively.\n\nRevenues for the second quarter of 2024 were $142.8 million, which was approximately 1% higher than first quarter of 2024 revenue of $140.8 million due to modestly higher realized prices partially offset by lower production volumes. Second quarter 2024 revenue was approximately 13% higher than $126.2 million of revenue in the second quarter of 2023 due to higher average realized prices, partially offset by moderately lower natural gas and NGL production volumes.\n\nLease Operating Expense: LOE, which includes base lease operating expenses, insurance premiums, workovers and facilities maintenance expenses, was $74.0 million in the second quarter of 2024, which was below the bottom end of the previously provided guidance range. LOE came in lower than expected as the Company continued to realize synergies from asset acquisitions in late 2023 and early 2024. LOE for the second quarter of 2024 was approximately 4% higher compared to $70.8 million in the first quarter of 2024 and up approximately 12% from $66.0 million for the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to higher base lease operating expenses related to the asset acquisitions in late 2023 and early 2024. On a component basis for the second quarter of 2024, base LOE and insurance premiums were $57.0 million, workovers were $2.4 million, and facilities maintenance and other expenses were $14.6 million. On a unit of production basis, LOE was $23.29 per Boe in the second quarter of 2024. This compares to $22.14 per Boe for the first quarter of 2024 and $19.60 per Boe for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nGathering, Transportation Costs and Production Taxes: Gathering, transportation costs and production taxes totaled $8.6 million ($2.70 per Boe) in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $7.5 million ($2.36 per Boe) in the first quarter of 2024 and $6.8 million ($2.02 per Boe) in the second quarter of 2023. Gathering, transportation costs and production taxes increased primarily due to higher processing fees for W&T's Mobile Bay production that had to be re-routed to a different processing plant.\n\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization (\"DD&A\"): DD&A was $11.55 per Boe in the second quarter of 2024. This compares to $10.61 per Boe and $8.37 per Boe for the first quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2023, respectively.\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations Accretion: Asset retirement obligations accretion was $2.64 per Boe in the second quarter of 2024. This compares to $2.49 per Boe and $2.29 per Boe for the first quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2023, respectively.\n\nGeneral & Administrative Expenses (\"G&A\"): G&A was $21.4 million for the second quarter of 2024, which increased from $20.5 million in the first quarter of 2024, and from $17.4 million in the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to non-recurring professional and legal services. On a unit of production basis, G&A was $6.72 per Boe in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $6.41 per Boe in the first quarter of 2024 and $5.16 per Boe in the corresponding period of 2023. G&A in the second quarter of 2024 included $1.4 million of non-cash compensation expense compared with $3.0 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $2.1 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nDerivative Loss (Gain), net: In the second quarter of 2024, W&T recorded a net loss of $2.4 million related to commodity derivative contracts comprised of a $2.7 million unrealized loss related to the decrease in fair value of open contracts and $0.3 million of realized gains. W&T recognized a net gain of $4.9 million in the first quarter of 2024 and a net gain of $0.8 million in the second quarter of 2023 related to commodity derivative activities.\n\nA summary of the Company's outstanding derivative positions is provided in the investor presentation posted on W&T's website.\n\nInterest Expense: Net interest expense in the second quarter of 2024 was $10.2 million compared to $10.1 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $10.3 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nOther Expense: During 2021 and 2022, as a result of the declaration of bankruptcy by a third party that is the indirect successor in title to certain offshore interests that were previously divested by the Company, W&T recorded a contingent loss accrual related to anticipated non-ARO plugging and abandonment costs. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company reassessed its existing obligations and recorded an additional $1.7 million.\n\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense: W&T recognized an income tax benefit of $4.6 million in the second quarter of 2024. This compares to the recognition of income tax expense of $1.0 million and $3.0 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively.\n\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity: As of June 30, 2024, W&T had available liquidity of $173.4 million comprised of $123.4 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $50.0 million of borrowing availability under W&T's first priority secured revolving facility provided by Calculus Lending LLC. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had total debt of $391.9 million and Net Debt of $268.5 million. Of W&T's total debt of $391.9 million, only $280.2 million is recourse to W&T. The remaining $111.7 million is held at W&T's wholly owned subsidiary, Aquasition Energy LLC, and is non-recourse to W&T. As of June 30, 2024, Net Debt to TTM Adjusted EBITDA was 1.4x.\n\nCapital Expenditures: Capital expenditures on an accrual basis (excluding acquisitions) in the second quarter of 2024 were $8.8 million, and asset retirement settlement costs totaled $8.2 million. For the first six months ended June 30, 2024, capital expenditures on an accrual basis (excluding acquisitions) totaled $11.9 million and asset retirements costs were $12.0 million. Investments related to acquisitions in the six months ended June 30, 2024 totaled $80.6 million, which included $77.3 million for the Cox acquisition and $3.3 million of final purchase price adjustments related to W&T's acquisition of properties in September 2023.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company performed three workovers and two recompletions that positively impacted production for the quarter. W&T plans to continue performing these low cost, short payout operations that impact both production and revenue.\n\nCash Dividend Policy\n\nThe Company paid its second quarter 2024 dividend of $0.01 per share on May 31, 2024 to stockholders of record on May 24, 2024.\n\nThe Board of Directors declared a third quarter 2024 dividend of $0.01 per share which is to be paid on August 27, 2024 to stockholders of record on August 20, 2024.\n\nMid-Year 2024 Proved Reserves\n\nAs calculated by NSAI, W&T's independent reserve engineering consultants, proved reserves using SEC pricing methodology totaled 141.9 MMBoe at June 30, 2024, compared with 123.0 MMBoe at year-end 2023. The increase in proved reserves was primarily driven by acquisition additions of 21.8 MMBoe and positive revisions of 3.5 MMBoe, partially offset by 6.3 MMBoe of production in the first half of 2024. The mid-year proved reserves, which were 54% proved developed producing, 29% proved developed non-producing, and 17% proved undeveloped, were 47% liquids (38% oil and 9% NGLs) and 53% natural gas. W&T operates approximately 94% of its mid-year 2024 proved reserves.\n\nThe pre-tax PV-10 of the mid-year 2024 proved reserves using SEC pricing was $1.4 billion (before consideration of expenditures for asset retirement obligations), an increase of 28% compared with the PV-10 of $1.1 billion at year-end 2023 using SEC pricing. The increase was primarily driven by the six additional fields acquired in January 2024. Mid-year 2024 SEC proved reserves and PV-10 were based on an average 12-month oil and natural gas prices of $79.45 per barrel and $2.32 per MMBtu, respectively. Prices used to determine proved reserves and PV-10 for year-end 2023 were $78.21 per barrel of oil and $2.64 per MMBtu of natural gas.\n\nThird Quarter and Full Year 2024 Production and Expense Guidance\n\nThe guidance for the third quarter and full year 2024 in the table below represents the Company's current expectations. Please refer to the section entitled \"Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\" below for risk factors that could impact guidance. Third quarter and full year 2024 guidance reflects the impact of third-party pipeline issues due to the Cox bankruptcy.\n\nW&T plans to spend more on LOE in the third quarter of 2024 to undertake some of the projects deferred earlier in the year. However, full year estimated LOE was reduced to a range of $280 million to $315 million, or about 5% at the mid-point, to take into account W&T's ability to lower costs and the benefit of synergies from recent acquisitions.\n\nW&T expects substantially all taxes in 2024 to be deferred.\n\nConference Call Information: W&T will hold a conference call to discuss its financial and operational results on Wednesday, August 7, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. Central Time (10:00 a.m. Eastern Time). Interested parties may dial 1-844-739-3797. International parties may dial 1-412-317-5713. Participants should request to connect to the \"W&T Offshore Conference Call.\" This call will also be webcast and available on W&T's website at www.wtoffshore.com under \"Investors.\" An audio replay will be available on the Company's website following the call.\n\nAbout W&T Offshore\n\nW&T Offshore, Inc. is an independent oil and natural gas producer with operations offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and has grown through acquisitions, exploration and development.

All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this release regarding the Company's financial position, operating and financial performance, business strategy, plans and objectives of management for future operations, projected costs, industry conditions, potential acquisitions, the impact of and integration of acquired assets, and indebtedness are forward-looking statements. When used in this release, forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by terms or phrases such as \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"predict,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"continue,\" \"anticipate,\" \"target,\" \"could,\" \"plan,\" \"intend,\" \"seek,\" \"goal,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"may\" or other words and similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. Items contemplating or making assumptions about actual or potential future production and sales, prices, market size, and trends or operating results also constitute such forward-looking statements.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations and assumptions about future events and speak only as of the date of this release. While management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the Company's control. Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, as results actually achieved may differ materially from expected results described in these statements. The Company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims, any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements, unless required by law.\n\nForward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially including, among other things, the regulatory environment, including availability or timing of, and conditions imposed on, obtaining and/or maintaining permits and approvals, including those necessary for drilling and/or development projects; the impact of current, pending and/or future laws and regulations, and of legislative and regulatory changes and other government activities, including those related to permitting, drilling, completion, well stimulation, operation, maintenance or abandonment of wells or facilities, managing energy, water, land, greenhouse gases or other emissions, protection of health, safety and the environment, or transportation, marketing and sale of the Company's products; inflation levels; global economic trends, geopolitical risks and general economic and industry conditions, such as the global supply chain disruptions and the government interventions into the financial markets and economy in response to inflation levels and world health events; volatility of oil, NGL and natural gas prices; the global energy future, including the factors and trends that are expected to shape it, such as concerns about climate change and other air quality issues, the transition to a low-emission economy and the expected role of different energy sources; supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs, including due to the actions of foreign producers, importantly including OPEC and other major oil producing companies (\"OPEC+\") and change in OPEC+'s production levels; disruptions to, capacity constraints in, or other limitations on the pipeline systems that deliver the Company's oil and natural gas and other processing and transportation considerations; inability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to obtain adequate financing to fund capital expenditures, meet the Company's working capital requirements or fund planned investments; price fluctuations and availability of natural gas and electricity; the Company's ability to use derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk; the Company's ability to meet the Company's planned drilling schedule, including due to the Company's ability to obtain permits on a timely basis or at all, and to successfully drill wells that produce oil and natural gas in commercially viable quantities; uncertainties associated with estimating proved reserves and related future cash flows; the Company's ability to replace the Company's reserves through exploration and development activities; drilling and production results, lower-than-expected production, reserves or resources from development projects or higher-than-expected decline rates; the Company's ability to obtain timely and available drilling and completion equipment and crew availability and access to necessary resources for drilling, completing and operating wells; changes in tax laws; effects of competition; uncertainties and liabilities associated with acquired and divested assets; the Company's ability to make acquisitions and successfully integrate any acquired businesses; asset impairments from commodity price declines; large or multiple customer defaults on contractual obligations, including defaults resulting from actual or potential insolvencies; geographical concentration of the Company's operations; the creditworthiness and performance of the Company's counterparties with respect to its hedges; impact of derivatives legislation affecting the Company's ability to hedge; failure of risk management and ineffectiveness of internal controls; catastrophic events, including tropical storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics and other world health events; environmental risks and liabilities under U.S. federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations (including remedial actions); potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; the Company's ability to recruit and/or retain key members of the Company's senior management and key technical employees; information technology failures or cyberattacks; and governmental actions and political conditions, as well as the actions by other third parties that are beyond the Company's control, and other factors discussed in W&T Offshore's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q found at www.sec.gov or at the Company's website at www.wtoffshore.com under the Investor Relations section.\n\n(1) MBoe is determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil, condensate or NGLs (totals may not compute due to rounding). The conversion ratio does not assume price equivalency and the price on an equivalent basis for oil, NGLs and natural gas may differ significantly. The realized prices presented above are volume-weighted for production in the respective period.\n\nW&T OFFSHORE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNon-GAAP Information\n\nCertain financial information included in W&T's financial results are not measures of financial performance recognized by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are \"Net Debt,\" \"Adjusted Net Loss,\" \"Adjusted EBITDA,\" \"Free Cash Flow\" and PV-10 or are derivable from a combination of these measures. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of performance. These disclosures may not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures which may be reported by other companies. Prior period amounts have been conformed to the methodology and presentation of the current period.\n\nWe calculate Net Debt as total debt (current and long-term portions), less cash and cash equivalents. Management uses Net Debt to evaluate the Company's financial position, including its ability to service its debt obligations.\n\nReconciliation of Net (Loss) Income to Adjusted Net Loss\n\nAdjusted Net Loss adjusts for certain items that the Company believes affect comparability of operating results, including items that are generally non-recurring in nature or whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. These items include unrealized commodity derivative gain, net, allowance for credit losses, write-off of debt issuance costs, non-recurring legal and IT-related costs, non-ARO plugging and abandonment costs, and other which are then tax effected using the Federal Statutory Rate.\n\nSelected items were tax effected with the Federal Statutory Rate of 21% for each respective period.\n\nW&T OFFSHORE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNon-GAAP Information\n\nAdjusted EBITDA/ Free Cash Flow Reconciliations\n\nThe Company also presents non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income plus net interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization, ARO accretion, excluding the unrealized commodity derivative loss (gain), allowance for credit losses, non-cash incentive compensation, non-recurring legal and IT-related costs, non-ARO plugging and abandonment costs, and other. Company management believes this presentation is relevant and useful because it helps investors understand W&T's operating performance and makes it easier to compare its results with those of other companies that have different financing, capital and tax structures. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for net income, as an indication of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA, as W&T calculates it, may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA measures reported by other companies. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not represent funds available for discretionary use.\n\nThe Company defines Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA (defined above), less capital expenditures, plugging and abandonment costs and net interest expense (all on an accrual basis). For this purpose, the Company's definition of capital expenditures includes costs incurred related to oil and natural gas properties (such as drilling and infrastructure costs and the lease maintenance costs) and equipment but excludes acquisition costs of oil and gas properties from third parties that are not included in the Company's capital expenditures guidance provided to investors. Company management believes that Free Cash Flow is an important financial performance measure for use in evaluating the performance and efficiency of its current operating activities after the impact of accrued capital expenditures, plugging and abandonment costs and net interest expense and without being impacted by items such as changes associated with working capital, which can vary substantially from one period to another. There is no commonly accepted definition of Free Cash Flow within the industry. Accordingly, Free Cash Flow, as defined and calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to Free Cash Flow or other similarly named non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. While the Company includes net interest expense in the calculation of Free Cash Flow, other mandatory debt service requirements of future payments of principal at maturity (if such debt is not refinanced) are excluded from the calculation of Free Cash Flow. These and other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from Free Cash Flow would reduce cash available for other uses.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the Company's net (loss) income, a GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, as such terms are defined by the Company:\n\nA reconciliation of the adjustment used to calculate Free Cash Flow to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements is included below:\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of cash flow from operating activities, a GAAP measure, to Free Cash Flow, as defined by the Company:\n\nA reconciliation of the adjustments used to calculate Free Cash Flow to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements is included below:\n\nReconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure\n\nThe Company also discloses PV-10, which is not a financial measure defined under GAAP. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for proved reserves calculated using SEC pricing. Company management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of PV-10 is relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 is also used internally when assessing the potential return on investment related to oil and natural gas properties and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. Company management believes that the use of PV-10 is valuable because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid. Additionally, Company management believes that the presentation of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor is it intended to represent the current market value of the Company's estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP. Investors should not assume that PV-10 of the Company's proved oil and natural gas reserves represents a current market value of the Company's estimated oil and natural gas reserves. With respect to PV-10 calculated as of an interim date (i.e., other than year-end), it is not practical for the Company to reconcile the PV-10 of its SEC pricing proved reserves as of June 30, 2024 because GAAP does not provide for disclosure of standardized measure on an interim basis.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors":

Announces Second Quarter 2024 - South Africa Today", "body": "FORT WORTH, Texas, Aug. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HighPeak Energy, Inc. (\"HighPeak\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: HPK) today announced financial and operating results for the quarter and the six months ended June 30, 2024, and provided updated 2024 guidance.\n\nHighlights\n\nSecond Quarter 2024\n\nSales volumes averaged 48,531 barrels of crude oil equivalent per day (\"Boe/d\"), consisting of 89% liquids (crude oil and NGL), representing a 15% increase over the second quarter 2023. Lease operating expenses were $6.79 per Boe compared with $8.39 per Boe in the second quarter 2023. Net income was $29.7 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, and EBITDAX (a non-GAAP financial measure defined and reconciled below) was $215.8 million, or $1.51 per diluted share. Adjusted net income (a non-GAAP financial measure defined and reconciled below) was $39.4 million, or $0.28 per diluted share. Generated free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure defined and reconciled below) of $13.4 million, which marks the fourth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. The Company reduced long-term debt by $30 million, paid a quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share and continued to execute its share buyback plan by repurchasing over 413,000 shares during the second quarter.\n\nRecent Events\n\nIncreased 2024 average production guidance by over 4% to a range of 45,000 to 49,000 Boe/d, up from 43,000 to 47,000 Boe/d. Reduced 2024 lease operating expense guidance range to $6.50 to $7.50 per Boe, down from $7.50 to $8.50 per Boe, a reduction of 12.5% at the midpoint. On August 5, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.04 per common share outstanding payable in September 2024.\n\nStatement from HighPeak Chairman and CEO, Jack Hightower:\n\nHighPeak continued its steadfast commitment to its core values - operating with discipline, strengthening the balance sheet and remaining focused on maximizing value for its shareholders. Our operations team continues to find ways to optimize productivity and efficiency, and combined with our continued strong well performance, we have experienced a meaningful uptick in production - with current volumes averaging over 52,000 Boe per day thus far in the third quarter. In addition, we have been able to drive lease operating costs lower than expected, leading to updating our 2024 development outlook in both areas.\n\nThrough our four years as a public company, we have assembled and continue to add to a great acreage position. We have 137 thousand acres consisting of undrilled inventory of over 2,600 locations of which more than 1,100 provide a minimum 10% return at $50 per barrel. We then focused on quickly growing our production to a material level of scale while delineating a deep inventory of highly economic locations. In the last year, we transitioned to a measured degree of growth while optimizing our field-wide operations and developing life-of-field infrastructure to sustain efficient and cost-effective operations moving forward. As we follow the natural progression of realizing value for our shareholders, we will continue to strive for excellence in all areas. The scarcity of remaining economic locations amidst the current market consolidation trend reinforces our belief that we are sitting in a prime position to maximize the value of our assets. Our strategic process is progressing nicely, and we remain very excited about what the future holds for HighPeak.\n\nUpdated 2024 Development Outlook\n\nOriginal Updated Production (Boe/d) \u25cf Average production rate 43,000 - 47,000 45,000 - 49,000 Unit Measures ($/Boe) \u25cf Lease Operating Expenses $7.50 - $8.50 $6.50 - $7.50 Capex ($MM) \u25cf Total Capital Expenditures $500 - $585 $540 - $580\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Operational Update\n\nHighPeak's sales volumes during the second quarter of 2024 averaged 48,531 Boe/d, a 15% increase over second quarter of 2023. Second quarter sales volumes consisted of approximately 89% liquids (crude oil and NGL).\n\nThe Company ran two drilling rigs and one frac crew during the second quarter, drilled 13 gross (13.0 net) horizontal wells and completed 25 gross (18.6 net) producing horizontal wells and 1 gross (1.0 net) salt-water disposal well. At June 30, 2024, the Company had 22 gross (18.5 net) horizontal wells in various stages of drilling and completion.\n\nHighPeak President, Michael Hollis, commented, \"The HighPeak team beat expectations again and because of their laser-focus on optimization and cost controls, we are able to raise production and lower operating cost guidance. As we mentioned last quarter, our capex burn-rate is first half weighted. This can be seen in the number of second quarter turn-in-lines and additional infrastructure projects located in our extension areas. We have tightened the capex range and expect to exit the year within our original budget.\"\n\nMr. Hollis continued, \"Contributing to this beat and raise for production, the recent outperformance of our wells to the east and on our newly added northern acreage further strengthens our already robust depth of inventory. The scarcity of sub $50 per barrel breakeven inventory in the lower 48, puts HighPeak Energy in a lucrative position with the current consolidation happening across the industry.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nHighPeak reported net income of $29.7 million for the second quarter of 2024, or $0.21 per diluted share, and adjusted net income of $39.4 million, or $0.28 per diluted share. The Company reported EBITDAX of $215.8 million, or $1.51 per diluted share.\n\nSecond quarter average realized prices were $81.39 per barrel (\"$/Bbl\") of crude oil, $20.32 per barrel of NGL and $0.13 per Mcf of natural gas, resulting in an overall realized price of $62.33 per Boe, or 77.3% of the weighted average of NYMEX crude oil prices, excluding the effects of derivatives. HighPeak's cash costs for the third quarter were $12.25 per Boe, including lease operating expenses of $6.79 per Boe, workover expenses of $0.63 per Boe, production and ad valorem taxes of $3.76 per Boe and G&A expenses of $1.07 per Boe. The Company's cash margin was $50.07 per Boe, or 80.3% of the overall realized price per Boe for the quarter, excluding the effects of derivatives.\n\nHighPeak's second quarter 2024 capital expenditures to drill, complete, equip, provide facilities and for infrastructure were $164.0 million.\n\nDividends\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, HighPeak's Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share, or $5.0 million in dividends paid to stockholders during the quarter. In addition, in August 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share, or approximately $5.0 million in dividends, to be paid on September 25, 2024 to stockholders of record on September 3, 2024.\n\nConference Call\n\nHighPeak will host a conference call and webcast on Tuesday, August 6, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. Central Time for investors and analysts to discuss its results for the second quarter of 2024.

When used in this document, the words \"believes,\" \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"forecasts,\" \"intends,\" \"continue,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"future,\" \"potential,\" \"estimate\" or the negative of such terms and similar expressions as they relate to HighPeak Energy, Inc. (\"HighPeak Energy,\" the \"Company\" or the \"Successor\") are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which are generally not historical in nature. The forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about the Company and the industry in which the Company operates. Although the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made, they involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, in many cases, beyond the Company's control. For example, the Company's review of strategic alternatives may not result in a sale of the Company, a recommendation that a transaction occur or result in a completed transaction, and any transaction that occurs may not increase shareholder value, in each case as a result of such risks and uncertainties.\n\nThese risks and uncertainties include, among other things, the results of the strategic review being undertaken by the Company's Board and the interest of prospective counterparties, the Company's ability to realize the results contemplated by its 2024 guidance, volatility of commodity prices, product supply and demand, the impact of a widespread outbreak of an illness, such as the coronavirus disease pandemic, on global and U.S. economic activity, competition, the ability to obtain environmental and other permits and the timing thereof, other government regulation or action, the ability to obtain approvals from third parties and negotiate agreements with third parties on mutually acceptable terms, litigation, the costs and results of drilling and operations, availability of equipment, services, resources and personnel required to perform the Company's drilling and operating activities, access to and availability of transportation, processing, fractionation, refining and storage facilities, HighPeak Energy's ability to replace reserves, implement its business plans or complete its development activities as scheduled, access to and cost of capital, the financial strength of counterparties to any credit facility and derivative contracts entered into by HighPeak Energy, if any, and purchasers of HighPeak Energy's oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production, uncertainties about estimates of reserves, identification of drilling locations and the ability to add proved reserves in the future, the assumptions underlying forecasts, including forecasts of production, expenses, cash flow from sales of oil and gas and tax rates, quality of technical data, environmental and weather risks, including the possible impacts of climate change, cybersecurity risks and acts of war or terrorism. These and other risks are described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K and other filings with the SEC. The Company undertakes no duty to publicly update these statements except as required by law.\n\nReserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of hydrocarbons that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made by reserve engineers. Reserves estimates included herein may not be indicative of the level of reserves or PV-10 value of oil and natural gas production in the future. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously. If significant, such revisions could impact HighPeak's strategy and change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ significantly from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.\n\nUse of Projections\n\nThe financial, operational, industry and market projections, estimates and targets in this press release and in the Company's guidance (including production, operating expenses and capital expenditures in future periods) are based on assumptions that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company's control. The assumptions and estimates underlying the projected, expected or target results are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, regulatory and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the financial, operational, industry and market projections, estimates and targets, including assumptions, risks and uncertainties described in \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" above. These projections are speculative by their nature and, accordingly, are subject to significant risk of not being actually realized by the Company. Projected results of the Company for 2024 are particularly speculative and subject to change. Actual results may vary materially from the current projections, including for reasons beyond the Company's control. The projections are based on current expectations and available information as of the date of this release. The Company undertakes no duty to publicly update these projections except as required by law.\n\nDrilling Locations\n\nThe Company has estimated its drilling locations based on well spacing assumptions and upon the evaluation of its drilling results and those of other operators in its area, combined with its interpretation of available geologic and engineering data. The drilling locations actually drilled on the Company's properties will depend on the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, commodity prices, costs, actual drilling results and other factors. Any drilling activities conducted on these identified locations may not be successful and may not result in additional proved reserves.

Our team continued to allocate capital towards acquisitions of high quality mineral rights with the greatest potential to generate attractive returns for our shareholders diversified across multiple basins and operators. In addition to our previously announced DJ Basin Acquisition, we closed on the acquisition of 2,110 NRAs in the Permian and DJ Basins from 6 separate transactions for approximately $38.5 million. Due to Sitio's 1H 2024 outperformance and the expected impacts from our newly acquired minerals, we are raising our full year 2024 production guidance range from 35,000 - 38,000 Boe/d to 36,000 - 38,000 Boe/d.\"\n\nUPDATED 2024 FULL YEAR FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL GUIDANCE\n\nThe table below includes Sitio's updated guidance for full year 2024 and includes impacts from the DJ Basin Acquisition as if the transaction had closed on January 1, 2024 for pro forma average daily production. Pro forma average daily production guidance includes an increase of 500 Boe/d at the midpoint, of which approximately 200 Boe/d is related to volumes from the 6 2Q 2024 previously unannounced acquisitions and the remainder is attributed to Sitio's legacy assets and the DJ Basin Acquisition. The midpoint of 2024 guidance for cash taxes decreased by $21.5 million based on latest estimates and includes an increase to our expected 2024 federal tax credit.\n\nOPERATOR ACTIVITY\n\nThe following table summarizes Sitio's net average daily production, net line-of-sight (\"LOS\") wells and net royalty acres by area. Pro forma NRAs assume that Sitio owned the DJ Basin Acquisition assets as of March 31, 2024.\n\nFINANCIAL UPDATE\n\nSitio's second quarter 2024 average unhedged realized prices including all expected quality, transportation and demand adjustments were $79.85 per barrel of oil, $1.01 per Mcf of natural gas and $20.32 per barrel of natural gas liquids, for a total price of $46.36 per barrel of oil equivalent (\"Boe\"). During the second quarter of 2024, the Company received $2.7 million in net cash settlements for commodity derivative contracts and as a result, average hedged realized prices were $80.21 per barrel of oil, $1.36 per Mcf of natural gas and $20.32 per barrel of natural gas liquids, for a total price of $47.13 per Boe. This represents a comparable $0.01 per Boe increase to hedged realized prices from the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n\nConsolidated net income for the second quarter of 2024 was $29.0 million, which is $10.3 million, or 55% higher than consolidated net income in the first quarter of 2024. This increase was primarily driven by $17.5 million higher oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues and $9.4 million lower commodity derivatives losses, partially offset by $9.2 million of increased depreciation, depletion and amortization, $4.2 million of increased interest expense and $2.1 million of increased income tax expense. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA was $151.6 million, up 12% compared to first quarter 2024 Adjusted EBITDA of $135.1 million largely due to higher average daily production volume and higher unhedged realized oil prices.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had $1,060.0 million principal value of total debt outstanding (comprised of a $460.0 million drawn on Sitio's revolving credit facility and $600.0 million of senior unsecured notes) and liquidity of $406.3 million, including $16.3 million of cash and $390.0 million of remaining availability under its $850.0 million credit facility.\n\nSitio did not add to or extinguish any of its commodity swaps or collars during the second quarter of 2024.

Sitio believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to Sitio's management and external users because they allow for a comparison of operating performance on a consistent basis across periods.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus (a) interest expense, (b) provisions for taxes, (c) depreciation, depletion and amortization, (d) non-cash share-based compensation expense, (e) impairment of oil and natural gas properties, (f) gains or losses on unsettled derivative instruments, (g) change in fair value of the warrant liability, (h) loss on debt extinguishment, (i) merger-related transaction costs and (j) write off of financing costs.\n\nWe define Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as Adjusted EBITDA plus DJ Basin Acquisition EBITDA from January 1, 2024 to March 31, 2024 that is not included in Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2024. A reconciliation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the three months ended March 31, 2024 is available in Exhibit 99.1 of Sitio's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 8, 2024.\n\nWe define Discretionary Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA, less cash and accrued interest expense and estimated cash taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2024.\n\nWe define Discretionary Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA, less cash interest and cash taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nWe define Cash G&A as general and administrative expense less (a) non-cash share-based compensation expense, (b) merger-related transaction costs and (c) rental income.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures do not represent and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP as measures of our financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Discretionary Cash Flow, and Cash G&A may differ from computations of similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the period indicated (in thousands).\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Discretionary Cash Flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the period indicated (in thousands).\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Cash G&A to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the period indicated (in thousands).\n\nAbout Sitio Royalties Corp.\n\nSitio is a shareholder returns-driven company focused on large-scale consolidation of high-quality oil & gas mineral and royalty interests across premium basins, with a diversified set of top-tier operators.

Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements that refer to projections, forecasts, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions. The words \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intends,\" \"may,\" \"might,\" \"plan,\" \"seeks,\" \"possible,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"prospects,\" \"guidance,\" \"outlook,\" \"should,\" \"would,\" \"will,\" and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the Company's expected results of operations, cash flows, financial position and future dividends; as well as certain future plans, expectations and objectives for the Company's operations, including statements about our return of capital framework, our share repurchase program, the implementation thereof and the intended benefits, financial and operational guidance, strategy, synergies, certain levels of production, future operations, financial position, prospects, and plans. While forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and analyses made by us that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, whether actual results and developments will meet our expectations and predictions depend on a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results, performance, and financial condition to differ materially from our expectations and predictions. Factors that could materially impact such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: commodity price volatility, the global economic uncertainty and market volatility related to slowing growth, the large-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the conflict in the Israel-Gaza region and continued hostilities in the Middle East including tensions with Iran, announcements of voluntary production cuts by OPEC+ and others, including OPEC's recent extensions of its voluntary production cuts, and those other factors discussed or referenced in the \"Risk Factors\" section of Sitio's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and other publicly filed documents with the SEC. Any forward-looking statement made in this news release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all of them. Sitio undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future development, or otherwise, except as may be required by law.", "source":

Announces Second Quarter 2024 Financial and Operating Results", "body": "On August 5, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.04 per common share outstanding payable in September 2024.\n\nStatement from HighPeak Chairman and CEO, Jack Hightower:\n\nHighPeak continued its steadfast commitment to its core values - operating with discipline, strengthening the balance sheet and remaining focused on maximizing value for its shareholders. Our operations team continues to find ways to optimize productivity and efficiency, and combined with our continued strong well performance, we have experienced a meaningful uptick in production - with current volumes averaging over 52,000 Boe per day thus far in the third quarter. In addition, we have been able to drive lease operating costs lower than expected, leading to updating our 2024 development outlook in both areas.\n\nThrough our four years as a public company, we have assembled and continue to add to a great acreage position. We have 137 thousand acres consisting of undrilled inventory of over 2,600 locations of which more than 1,100 provide a minimum 10% return at $50 per barrel. We then focused on quickly growing our production to a material level of scale while delineating a deep inventory of highly economic locations. In the last year, we transitioned to a measured degree of growth while optimizing our field-wide operations and developing life-of-field infrastructure to sustain efficient and cost-effective operations moving forward. As we follow the natural progression of realizing value for our shareholders, we will continue to strive for excellence in all areas. The scarcity of remaining economic locations amidst the current market consolidation trend reinforces our belief that we are sitting in a prime position to maximize the value of our assets. Our strategic process is progressing nicely, and we remain very excited about what the future holds for HighPeak.\n\nHighPeak's sales volumes during the second quarter of 2024 averaged 48,531 Boe/d, a 15% increase over second quarter of 2023. Second quarter sales volumes consisted of approximately 89% liquids (crude oil and NGL).\n\nThe Company ran two drilling rigs and one frac crew during the second quarter, drilled 13 gross (13.0 net) horizontal wells and completed 25 gross (18.6 net) producing horizontal wells and 1 gross (1.0 net) salt-water disposal well. At June 30, 2024, the Company had 22 gross (18.5 net) horizontal wells in various stages of drilling and completion.\n\nHighPeak President, Michael Hollis, commented, \"The HighPeak team beat expectations again and because of their laser-focus on optimization and cost controls, we are able to raise production and lower operating cost guidance. As we mentioned last quarter, our capex burn-rate is first half weighted. This can be seen in the number of second quarter turn-in-lines and additional infrastructure projects located in our extension areas. We have tightened the capex range and expect to exit the year within our original budget.\"\n\nMr. Hollis continued, \"Contributing to this beat and raise for production, the recent outperformance of our wells to the east and on our newly added northern acreage further strengthens our already robust depth of inventory. The scarcity of sub $50 per barrel breakeven inventory in the lower 48, puts HighPeak Energy in a lucrative position with the current consolidation happening across the industry.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nHighPeak reported net income of $29.7 million for the second quarter of 2024, or $0.21 per diluted share, and adjusted net income of $39.4 million, or $0.28 per diluted share. The Company reported EBITDAX of $215.8 million, or $1.51 per diluted share.\n\nSecond quarter average realized prices were $81.39 per barrel (\"$/Bbl\") of crude oil, $20.32 per barrel of NGL and $0.13 per Mcf of natural gas, resulting in an overall realized price of $62.33 per Boe, or 77.3% of the weighted average of NYMEX crude oil prices, excluding the effects of derivatives. HighPeak's cash costs for the third quarter were $12.25 per Boe, including lease operating expenses of $6.79 per Boe, workover expenses of $0.63 per Boe, production and ad valorem taxes of $3.76 per Boe and G&A expenses of $1.07 per Boe. The Company's cash margin was $50.07 per Boe, or 80.3% of the overall realized price per Boe for the quarter, excluding the effects of derivatives.\n\nHighPeak's second quarter 2024 capital expenditures to drill, complete, equip, provide facilities and for infrastructure were $164.0 million.\n\nDividends\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, HighPeak's Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share, or $5.0 million in dividends paid to stockholders during the quarter. In addition, in August 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share, or approximately $5.0 million in dividends, to be paid on September 25, 2024 to stockholders of record on September 3, 2024.\n\nConference Call\n\nHighPeak will host a conference call and webcast on Tuesday, August 6, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. Central Time for investors and analysts to discuss its results for the second quarter of 2024.

For more information, please visit our website at www.highpeakenergy.com.\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThe information in this press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. When used in this document, the words \"believes,\" \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"forecasts,\" \"intends,\" \"continue,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"future,\" \"potential,\" \"estimate\" or the negative of such terms and similar expressions as they relate to HighPeak Energy, Inc. (\"HighPeak Energy,\" the \"Company\" or the \"Successor\") are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which are generally not historical in nature. The forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about the Company and the industry in which the Company operates. Although the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made, they involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, in many cases, beyond the Company's control. For example, the Company's review of strategic alternatives may not result in a sale of the Company, a recommendation that a transaction occur or result in a completed transaction, and any transaction that occurs may not increase shareholder value, in each case as a result of such risks and uncertainties.\n\nThese risks and uncertainties include, among other things, the results of the strategic review being undertaken by the Company's Board and the interest of prospective counterparties, the Company's ability to realize the results contemplated by its 2024 guidance, volatility of commodity prices, product supply and demand, the impact of a widespread outbreak of an illness, such as the coronavirus disease pandemic, on global and U.S. economic activity, competition, the ability to obtain environmental and other permits and the timing thereof, other government regulation or action, the ability to obtain approvals from third parties and negotiate agreements with third parties on mutually acceptable terms, litigation, the costs and results of drilling and operations, availability of equipment, services, resources and personnel required to perform the Company's drilling and operating activities, access to and availability of transportation, processing, fractionation, refining and storage facilities, HighPeak Energy's ability to replace reserves, implement its business plans or complete its development activities as scheduled, access to and cost of capital, the financial strength of counterparties to any credit facility and derivative contracts entered into by HighPeak Energy, if any, and purchasers of HighPeak Energy's oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production, uncertainties about estimates of reserves, identification of drilling locations and the ability to add proved reserves in the future, the assumptions underlying forecasts, including forecasts of production, expenses, cash flow from sales of oil and gas and tax rates, quality of technical data, environmental and weather risks, including the possible impacts of climate change, cybersecurity risks and acts of war or terrorism. These and other risks are described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K and other filings with the SEC. The Company undertakes no duty to publicly update these statements except as required by law.\n\nReserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of hydrocarbons that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made by reserve engineers. Reserves estimates included herein may not be indicative of the level of reserves or PV-10 value of oil and natural gas production in the future. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously. If significant, such revisions could impact HighPeak's strategy and change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ significantly from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.\n\nUse of Projections\n\nThe financial, operational, industry and market projections, estimates and targets in this press release and in the Company's guidance (including production, operating expenses and capital expenditures in future periods) are based on assumptions that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company's control. The assumptions and estimates underlying the projected, expected or target results are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, regulatory and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the financial, operational, industry and market projections, estimates and targets, including assumptions, risks and uncertainties described in \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" above. These projections are speculative by their nature and, accordingly, are subject to significant risk of not being actually realized by the Company. Projected results of the Company for 2024 are particularly speculative and subject to change. Actual results may vary materially from the current projections, including for reasons beyond the Company's control. The projections are based on current expectations and available information as of the date of this release. The Company undertakes no duty to publicly update these projections except as required by law.\n\nDrilling Locations\n\nThe Company has estimated its drilling locations based on well spacing assumptions and upon the evaluation of its drilling results and those of other operators in its area, combined with its interpretation of available geologic and engineering data. The drilling locations actually drilled on the Company's properties will depend on the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, commodity prices, costs, actual drilling results and other factors. Any drilling activities conducted on these identified locations may not be successful and may not result in additional proved reserves. Further, to the extent the drilling locations are associated with acreage that expires, the Company would lose its right to develop the related locations.", "source": {"uri": "wallstreet-online.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "wallstreet:online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_well", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oil well"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_call", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conference call"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Derivative (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Hightower", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Hightower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_cost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating cost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drilling_rig", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drilling rig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Webcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midland, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Midland, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/globenewswire-1280.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804164", "eventUri": "eng-9804164", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-20", "textStart": 5885, "textEnd": 5894}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-17", "textStart": 6034, "textEnd": 6046}], "sentiment": 0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Our teams continue to execute reliably and with excellence, and we remain on track to deliver results in line with our full year guidance provided earlier this year. We are focused on creating value by generating sustainable free cash flow with high rates of return in low capital intensity projects, optimizing our cost structure, and maintaining balance sheet strength while meeting high compliance standards,\" said Fernando Araujo, Berry's Chief Executive Officer.\n\nHe continued, \"The Uinta Basin has seen increased activity and consolidation. Development activity focused on drilling horizontal wells across the basin is moving towards our existing acreage. In April 2024, we purchased a 21% working interest in four, two-to-three mile lateral wells in the Uteland Butte reservoir, which were put on production in the second quarter of 2024. These wells are adjacent to our existing operations and their results will be used to evaluate similar horizontal opportunities on our own acreage. This four-well horizontal program is exceeding pre-drill estimates. With a high working interest in almost 100,000 acres and the majority of acreage held by production in multiple trends, we are strategically positioned to develop our own acreage horizontally at an optimal pace.\"\n\nSelected Comparative Results\n\n__________\n\n\"We generated Adjusted EBITDA of $74 million in the second quarter, a 7% increase over the first quarter of 2024, with Cash Flow from Operations totaling $71 million and Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $19 million. Compared to the first quarter of 2024, lease operating expenses per boe in the second quarter were down 11% to $23.47 per boe, due primarily to lower energy costs. We continued to drive cost savings throughout the organization and prioritize debt reduction, reducing our revolver balance by nearly 30% to $36 million at the end of the second quarter. This balance was further reduced to $28 million at the end of July even after the final deferred payment from last year's Macpherson acquisition of $20 million. In the near term, we are also looking opportunistically to refinance our notes, which mature in early 2026,\" stated Mike Helm, Berry's CFO.\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial and Operating Results\n\nQ2 2024 Compared to Q1 2024\n\nOil, natural gas and NGL revenues (excluding hedging settlements) for the second quarter of 2024 increased from the first quarter of 2024, driven by slightly higher oil prices. The net loss for the second quarter of 2024 included a $33 million after-tax impairment of unproved oil and gas properties driven by the implementation of California's SB 1137 set-back regulations. The improvement of the net loss compared to the first quarter of 2024 included lower lease operating expenses, driven by lower fuel gas volumes purchased, as a result of our cost savings initiatives to reduce steam, as well as a decline in fuel prices. The second quarter of 2024 also included improved hedging results. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income increased in the second quarter of 2024, compared to the prior quarter. Improved working capital for the second quarter drove increased cash flows from operations and Adjusted Free Cash Flow compared to the first quarter of 2024. Capital expenditures were $42 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $17 million in the first quarter of 2024, with the increase driven by accelerated development in California and facilities projects, as well as the Utah farm-in development program. At June 30, 2024, the Company had liquidity of $169 million, consisting of $7 million cash and $162 million available for borrowings under its revolving credit facilities.\n\nQ2 2024 Compared to Q2 2023\n\nCompared to the second quarter of the prior year, oil, natural gas and NGL revenues (excluding hedging settlements) increased, which were driven by higher oil prices, offset by lower production in the second quarter of 2024. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2024 increased 8% and Adjusted Net Income increased 21% compared to the second quarter of 2023, driven by the increased commodity revenues, a 16% decrease in general and administrative costs and a 1% decrease in lease operating expenses. Cash flow from operations increased in the second quarter of 2024 and Adjusted Free Cash Flow decreased compared to the second quarter of 2023, due to higher capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2024. Capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2024 were $42 million and increased 93% compared to the second quarter of 2023. For the second quarter of 2024, we drilled 19 wells, of which 15 are in California, plus four vertical wells in Utah, with production from our drilling activity in California outperforming expected results.\n\nQuarterly Dividends\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors declared dividends totaling $0.17 per share on the Company's outstanding common stock, consisting of a fixed dividend of $0.12 per share and variable dividend of $0.05 per share based on the cumulative Adjusted Free Cash Flow results for the six months ended June 30, 2024. Both dividends are payable on August 20, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 12, 2024.\n\nEarnings Conference Call\n\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss these results:\n\nIf you would like to ask a question on the live call, please preregister at any time using the following link:\n\nhttps://register.vevent.com/register/BI9f9fa21c30284d749f1657af20bc94dc.\n\nOnce registered, you will receive the dial-in numbers and a unique PIN number.

Therefore, the sum of the numbers in a column may not conform exactly to the total figure given for that column in certain tables.

The Company's key exposure to gas prices is in costs. The Company purchases substantially more natural gas for California steamfloods and cogeneration facilities than what is produced and sold in the Rockies. The Company purchases most of its gas in the Rockies and transports it to its California operations using the Kern River pipeline capacity. The Company buys approximately 48,000 mmbtu/d in the Rockies, and the remainder comes from California markets. The volume purchased in California fluctuates and averaged 2,000 mmbtu/d in the second quarter of 2024, 5,000 mmbtu/d in the first quarter of 2024 and 6,000 mmbtu/d in the second quarter of 2023. The natural gas purchased in the Rockies is shipped to operations in California to help limit exposure to California fuel gas purchase price fluctuations. The Company strives to further minimize the variability of fuel gas costs for steam operations by hedging a significant portion of gas purchases. Additionally, the negative impact of higher gas prices on California operating expenses is partially offset by higher gas sales for the gas produced and sold in the Rockies. The Kern capacity allows us to purchase and sell natural gas at the same pricing indices.\n\nCURRENT HEDGING SUMMARY\n\nAs of August 6, 2024, we had the following crude oil production and gas purchases hedges.\n\n__________\n\n(LOSSES) GAINS ON DERIVATIVES\n\nA summary of gains and losses on the derivatives included on the statements of operations is presented below:\n\nE&P FIELD OPERATIONS\n\nOverall, management assesses the efficiency of the Company's E&P field operations by considering core E&P operating expenses together with cogeneration, marketing and transportation activities. In particular, a core component of E&P operations in California is steam, which is used to lift heavy oil to the surface. The Company operates several cogeneration facilities to produce some of the steam needed in operations. In comparing the cost effectiveness of cogeneration plants against other sources of steam in operations, management considers the cost of operating the cogeneration plants, including the cost of the natural gas purchased to operate the facilities, against the value of the steam and electricity used in E&P field operations and the revenues received from sales of excess electricity to the grid. The Company strives to minimize the variability of its fuel gas costs for California steam operations with natural gas purchase hedges. Consequently, the efficiency of E&P field operations are impacted by the cash settlements received or paid from these derivatives. The Company also has contracts for the transportation of fuel gas from the Rockies, which has historically been cheaper than the California markets. With respect to transportation and marketing, management also considers opportunistic sales of incremental capacity in assessing the overall efficiencies of E&P operations.\n\nLease operating expenses include fuel, labor, field office, vehicle, supervision, maintenance, tools and supplies, and workover expenses. Electricity generation expenses include the portion of fuel, labor, maintenance, and tools and supplies from two of the Company's cogeneration facilities allocated to electricity generation expense; the remaining cogeneration expenses are included in lease operating expense. Transportation expenses relate to costs to transport the oil and gas that is produced within the Company's properties or moved to the market. Marketing expenses mainly relate to natural gas purchased from third parties that moves through gathering and processing systems and then is sold to third parties. Electricity revenue is from the sale of excess electricity from two of the Company's cogeneration facilities to a California utility company under long-term contracts at market prices. These cogeneration facilities are sized to satisfy the steam needs in their respective fields, but the corresponding electricity produced is more than the electricity that is currently required for the operations in those fields. Transportation sales relate to water and other liquids that transport on the Company's systems on behalf of third parties and marketing revenues represent sales of natural gas purchased from and sold to third parties.\n\nPRODUCTION STATISTICS\n\n__________\n\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\n\n__________\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS\n\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) is not a measure of net income (loss), Adjusted Free Cash Flow is not a measure of cash flow, and Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of either net income (loss) or cash flow, in all cases, as determined by GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense; income taxes; depreciation, depletion, and amortization; derivative gains or losses net of cash received or paid for scheduled derivative settlements; impairments; stock compensation expense; and unusual and infrequent items. Our management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in assessing our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and is widely used by the industry and the investment community. The measure also allows our management to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results between periods without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We also use Adjusted EBITDA in planning our capital expenditure allocation to sustain production levels and to determine our strategic hedging needs aside from the hedging requirements of the 2021 RBL Facility.\n\nWe define Adjusted Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash flow from operations less regular fixed dividends and capital expenditures. In 2024, we updated the definition of Adjusted Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP measure, as cash flow from operations less regular fixed dividends and capital expenditures. This update better aligns with the full capital expenditure requirements of the Company. For 2023, Adjusted Free Cash Flow was defined as cash flow from operations less regular fixed dividends and maintenance capital. Management believes Adjusted Free Cash Flow may be useful in an investor analysis of our ability to generate cash from operating activities from our existing oil and gas asset base after maintaining the existing production volumes of that asset base to return capital to stockholders, fund further business expansion through acquisitions or investments in our existing asset base to increase production volumes and pay other non-discretionary expenses. Management also uses Adjusted Free Cash Flow as the primary metric to plan for future growth.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance, and it should not be inferred that the entire amount of Adjusted Free Cash Flow is available for variable dividends, debt or share repurchases, strategic acquisitions or other growth opportunities, or other discretionary expenditures, since we have mandatory debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from this measure.\n\nWe define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as net income (loss) adjusted for derivative gains or losses net of cash received or paid for scheduled derivative settlements, unusual and infrequent items, and the income tax expense or benefit of these adjustments using our statutory tax rate. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) excludes the impact of unusual and infrequent items affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably, including non-cash items such as derivative gains and losses. This measure is used by management when comparing results period over period. We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is useful to investors because it reflects how management evaluates the Company's ongoing financial and operating performance from period-to-period after removing certain transactions and activities that affect comparability of the metrics and are not reflective of the Company's core operations. We believe this also makes it easier for investors to compare our period-to-period results with our peers.\n\nWe define Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses as general and administrative expenses adjusted for non-cash stock compensation expense and unusual and infrequent costs. Management believes Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses is useful because it allows us to more effectively compare our performance from period to period. We believe Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses is useful to investors because it reflects how management evaluates the Company's ongoing general and administrative expenses from period-to-period after removing non-cash stock compensation, as well as unusual or infrequent costs that affect comparability of the metrics and are not reflective of the Company's administrative costs. We believe this also makes it easier for investors to compare our period-to-period results with our peers.\n\nWhile Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses are non-GAAP measures, the amounts included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses were computed in accordance with GAAP. These measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, income and liquidity measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than income and liquidity measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance, such as our cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable and depletable assets. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nADJUSTED EBITDA\n\nThe following tables present reconciliations of the GAAP financial measures of net income (loss) and net cash provided (used) by operating activities to the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA, as applicable, for each of the periods indicated.\n\n__________\n\nADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of operating cash flow to the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted Free Cash Flow for each of the periods indicated.

This most recent quarter represents corporate records for each of water sales and produced water royalties revenues, which is a testament to the water segment's continued success and relevance to TPL overall. The Permian Basin, with its enormous size and excellent resource quality, provides TPL a long growth runway, and we remain focused on extracting maximum value where we can leverage our superb people, technology, and asset footprint.\"\n\nFinancial Results for the Second Quarter of 2024 - Sequential\n\nThe Company reported net income of $114.6 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to net income of $114.4 million for the first quarter of 2024.\n\nTotal revenues for the second quarter of 2024 were $172.3 million compared to $174.1 million for the first quarter of 2024. The slight decrease in revenues is primarily due to a decrease of $4.1 million in easements and other surface-related income and a $2.3 million decrease in oil and gas royalty revenue compared to the first quarter of 2024. While the Company's share of production was 24.9 thousand Boe per day for the second quarter of 2024 versus 24.8 thousand Boe per day for the first quarter of 2024, the average realized price decreased 3% to $41.44 per Boe in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $42.71 per Boe in the first quarter of 2024. These decreases in revenue were partially offset by increases of $3.5 million in water sales and $2.3 million in produced water royalties over the same period. The growth in water sales is principally due to an increase of 16.5% in water sales volumes for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024. Our revenue streams are directly impacted by commodity prices and development and operating decisions made by our customers.\n\nTotal operating expenses were $39.1 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $38.1 million for the first quarter of 2024. The change in operating expenses is principally related to an increase in water service-related expenses over the same time period.\n\nFinancial Results for the Second Quarter of 2024 - Year Over Year\n\nTotal revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2024 were $346.5 million compared to $307.0 million for the same period of 2023. All revenue streams, except land sales, increased for the six months ended June 30, 2024 with the $18.4 million increase in water sales being the biggest contributor. The growth in water sales is principally due to an increase of 25.5% in water sales volumes. Additionally, oil and gas royalty revenue increased $10.4 million primarily due to higher production volumes for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Oil and gas royalty revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2023 included an $8.7 million settlement with an operator with respect to unpaid oil and gas royalties for older production periods. Excluding the impact of the $8.7 million settlement on 2023 revenues, oil and gas royalty revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased $19.1 million over the six months ended June 30, 2023. The Company's share of production was 24.9 thousand Boe per day for the six months ended June 30, 2024 versus 22.9 thousand Boe per day for the same period of 2023. The average realized price was $42.07 per Boe for the six months ended June 30, 2024 versus $41.08 per Boe for the same period of 2023. TPL's revenue streams are directly impacted by commodity prices and development and operating decisions made by our customers.\n\nTotal operating expenses were $77.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $81.7 million for the same period of 2023. The change in operating expenses is principally related to a decrease in legal and professional fees for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, partially offset by higher water service-related expenses due to the 25.5% increase in water sales volumes.\n\nSpecial Cash Dividend Declared\n\nOn June 13, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") declared a special cash dividend of $10.00 per share which was paid on July 15, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 1, 2024.\n\nQuarterly Dividend Declared\n\nOn August 6, 2024, the Company's Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.17 per share, payable on September 17, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 3, 2024.\n\nConference Call and Webcast Information\n\nThe Company will hold a conference call on Thursday, August 8, 2024 at 7:30 a.m. Central Time to discuss second quarter results. A live webcast of the conference call will be available on the Investors section of the Company's website at http://www.TexasPacific.com.

The Company is not an oil and gas producer, but its surface and royalty ownership provide revenue opportunities throughout the life cycle of a well. These revenue opportunities include fixed fee payments for use of our land, revenue for sales of materials (caliche) used in the construction of infrastructure, providing sourced water and/or treated produced water, revenue from our oil and gas royalty interests, and revenues related to saltwater disposal on our land. The Company also generates revenue from pipeline, power line and utility easements, commercial leases and temporary permits related to a variety of land uses including midstream infrastructure projects and hydrocarbon processing facilities.\n\nVisit TPL at http://www.TexasPacific.com.\n\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis news release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are based on TPL's beliefs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, TPL, and therefore involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Generally, future or conditional verbs such as \"will,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" or \"may\" and the words \"believe,\" \"anticipate,\" \"continue,\" \"intend,\" \"expect\" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, references to strategies, plans, objectives, expectations, intentions, assumptions, future operations and prospects and other statements that are not historical facts. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Although TPL believes that plans, intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by any forward-looking statements made herein are reasonable, TPL may be unable to achieve such plans, intentions or expectations and actual results, and performance or achievements may vary materially and adversely from those envisaged in this news release due to a number of factors including, but not limited to: the initiation or outcome of potential litigation; and any changes in general economic and/or industry specific conditions. These risks, as well as other risks associated with TPL are also more fully discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. You can access TPL's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") through the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov and TPL strongly encourages you to do so. Except as required by applicable law, TPL undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or other statements herein for revisions or changes after this communication is made.\n\nNON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND DEFINITIONS\n\nIn addition to amounts presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), we also present certain supplemental non-GAAP performance measurements. These measurements are not to be considered more relevant or accurate than the measurements presented in accordance with GAAP. In compliance with the requirements of the SEC, our non-GAAP measurements are reconciled to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP performance measure. For all non-GAAP measurements, neither the SEC nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on these non-GAAP measurements.\n\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow\n\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measurement of earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization. Its purpose is to highlight earnings without finance, taxes, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and its use is limited to specialized analysis. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus employee share-based compensation. Its purpose is to highlight earnings without non-cash activity such as share-based compensation and other non-recurring or unusual items, if applicable. We calculate Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less current income tax expense and capital expenditures. Its purpose is to provide an additional measure of operating performance. We have presented EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow because we believe that these metrics are useful supplements to net income in analyzing the Company's operating performance. Our definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow may differ from computations of similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 and for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 (in thousands):\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240807669797/en/", "source": {"uri": "wallstreet-online.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "wallstreet:online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalty_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royalty payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Produced_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Produced water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian_Basin_(North_America)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Permian Basin (North America)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Easement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telephone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization_(accounting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amortization (accounting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accounting standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/businesswire-1280.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804164", "eventUri": "eng-9804164", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-06-", "textStart": 4515, "textEnd": 4522}, {"amb": false, "date": "2015-07-", "textStart": 4648, "textEnd": 4655}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-09-", "textStart": 4865, "textEnd": 4877}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

The details for today's earnings call and webcast are listed below.\n\nQuarterly Highlights & Recent Announcements\n\nProduced 25,300 Boe/d, flat to first quarter; above the midpoint of 2024 annual guidance of 25,200 boe/dCost reductions on pace, highlighted by 11% sequential quarter decrease in Lease Operating ExpensesDeclared second quarter dividends of $0.17 per share, including $0.12/share fixed and $0.05/share variableFour horizontal farm-in wells from the Uinta Basin's prolific Uteland Butte reservoir performing above pre-drill estimatesReported zero recordable incidents and zero lost-time incidents for the third consecutive quarterReached 60% completion of, and on schedule to meet methane emissions reduction target associated with our existing operations,\n\n\"In the second quarter, we delivered strong financial and operational results. Our teams continue to execute reliably and with excellence, and we remain on track to deliver results in line with our full year guidance provided earlier this year. We are focused on creating value by generating sustainable free cash flow with high rates of return in low capital intensity projects, optimizing our cost structure, and maintaining balance sheet strength while meeting high compliance standards,\" said Fernando Araujo, Berry's Chief Executive Officer.\n\nHe continued, \"The Uinta Basin has seen increased activity and consolidation. Development activity focused on drilling horizontal wells across the basin is moving towards our existing acreage. In April 2024, we purchased a 21% working interest in four, two-to-three mile lateral wells in the Uteland Butte reservoir, which were put on production in the second quarter of 2024. These wells are adjacent to our existing operations and their results will be used to evaluate similar horizontal opportunities on our own acreage. This four-well horizontal program is exceeding pre-drill estimates. With a high working interest in almost 100,000 acres and the majority of acreage held by production in multiple trends, we are strategically positioned to develop our own acreage horizontally at an optimal pace.\"\n\nSelected Comparative Results\n\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 June 30, 2023 (unaudited)\n\n(in millions, except per share amounts)Oil, natural gas & NGL revenues(1)$169 $166 $158Net (loss) income$(9) $(40) $26Adjusted Net Income(2)$14 $11 $12Cash flow from operations$71 $27 $63Adjusted EBITDA(2)$74 $69 $69(Loss) earnings per diluted share$(0.11) $(0.53) $0.33Adjusted earnings per diluted share(2)$0.18 $0.14 $0.15Adjusted free cash flow(2)$19 $1 $34Capital expenditures$42 $17 $22Production (mboe/d) 25.3 25.4 25.9\n\n__________\n\n(1) Revenues do not include hedge settlements.\n\n(2) Please see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations\" later in this press release for reconciliation and more information on these Non-GAAP measures.\n\n\"We generated Adjusted EBITDA of $74 million in the second quarter, a 7% increase over the first quarter of 2024, with Cash Flow from Operations totaling $71 million and Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $19 million. Compared to the first quarter of 2024, lease operating expenses per boe in the second quarter were down 11% to $23.47 per boe, due primarily to lower energy costs. We continued to drive cost savings throughout the organization and prioritize debt reduction, reducing our revolver balance by nearly 30% to $36 million at the end of the second quarter. This balance was further reduced to $28 million at the end of July even after the final deferred payment from last year's Macpherson acquisition of $20 million. In the near term, we are also looking opportunistically to refinance our notes, which mature in early 2026,\" stated Mike Helm, Berry's CFO.\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial and Operating Results\n\nQ2 2024 Compared to Q1 2024\n\nOil, natural gas and NGL revenues (excluding hedging settlements) for the second quarter of 2024 increased from the first quarter of 2024, driven by slightly higher oil prices. The net loss for the second quarter of 2024 included a $33 million after-tax impairment of unproved oil and gas properties driven by the implementation of California's SB 1137 set-back regulations. The improvement of the net loss compared to the first quarter of 2024 included lower lease operating expenses, driven by lower fuel gas volumes purchased, as a result of our cost savings initiatives to reduce steam, as well as a decline in fuel prices. The second quarter of 2024 also included improved hedging results. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income increased in the second quarter of 2024, compared to the prior quarter. Improved working capital for the second quarter drove increased cash flows from operations and Adjusted Free Cash Flow compared to the first quarter of 2024. Capital expenditures were $42 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $17 million in the first quarter of 2024, with the increase driven by accelerated development in California and facilities projects, as well as the Utah farm-in development program. At June 30, 2024, the Company had liquidity of $169 million, consisting of $7 million cash and $162 million available for borrowings under its revolving credit facilities.\n\nQ2 2024 Compared to Q2 2023\n\nCompared to the second quarter of the prior year, oil, natural gas and NGL revenues (excluding hedging settlements) increased, which were driven by higher oil prices, offset by lower production in the second quarter of 2024. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2024 increased 8% and Adjusted Net Income increased 21% compared to the second quarter of 2023, driven by the increased commodity revenues, a 16% decrease in general and administrative costs and a 1% decrease in lease operating expenses. Cash flow from operations increased in the second quarter of 2024 and Adjusted Free Cash Flow decreased compared to the second quarter of 2023, due to higher capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2024. Capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2024 were $42 million and increased 93% compared to the second quarter of 2023. For the second quarter of 2024, we drilled 19 wells, of which 15 are in California, plus four vertical wells in Utah, with production from our drilling activity in California outperforming expected results.\n\nQuarterly Dividends\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors declared dividends totaling $0.17 per share on the Company's outstanding common stock, consisting of a fixed dividend of $0.12 per share and variable dividend of $0.05 per share based on the cumulative Adjusted Free Cash Flow results for the six months ended June 30, 2024. Both dividends are payable on August 20, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 12, 2024.\n\nEarnings Conference Call\n\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss these results:\n\nCall Date:Friday, August 9, 2024Call Time:8:30 a.m. Eastern Time / 7:30 am a.m. Central Time / 5:30 a.m. Pacific TimeJoin the live listen-only audio webcast at https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/pq98oify\n\nor at https://bry.com/category/events\n\nIf you would like to ask a question on the live call, please preregister at any time using the following link:\n\nhttps://register.vevent.com/register/BI9f9fa21c30284d749f1657af20bc94dc.\n\nOnce registered, you will receive the dial-in numbers and a unique PIN number.

SoCal Gas city-gate Index is the relevant index used only for the portion of gas purchases in California.\n\n(2) Most of our gas purchases and gas sales in the Rockies are predicated on the Northwest, Rocky Mountains index, and to a lesser extent based on Henry Hub.\n\nNatural gas prices and differentials are strongly affected by local market fundamentals, availability of transportation capacity from producing areas and seasonal impacts. The Company's key exposure to gas prices is in costs. The Company purchases substantially more natural gas for California steamfloods and cogeneration facilities than what is produced and sold in the Rockies. The Company purchases most of its gas in the Rockies and transports it to its California operations using the Kern River pipeline capacity. The Company buys approximately 48,000 mmbtu/d in the Rockies, and the remainder comes from California markets. The volume purchased in California fluctuates and averaged 2,000 mmbtu/d in the second quarter of 2024, 5,000 mmbtu/d in the first quarter of 2024 and 6,000 mmbtu/d in the second quarter of 2023. The natural gas purchased in the Rockies is shipped to operations in California to help limit exposure to California fuel gas purchase price fluctuations. The Company strives to further minimize the variability of fuel gas costs for steam operations by hedging a significant portion of gas purchases. Additionally, the negative impact of higher gas prices on California operating expenses is partially offset by higher gas sales for the gas produced and sold in the Rockies. The Kern capacity allows us to purchase and sell natural gas at the same pricing indices.\n\nCURRENT HEDGING SUMMARY\n\nAs of August 6, 2024, we had the following crude oil production and gas purchases hedges.\n\nQ3 2024 Q4 2024 FY 2025 FY 2026 FY 2027 FY 2028 FY 2029Brent - Crude Oil production Swaps Hedged volume (bbls) 1,481,749 1,438,656 4,951,125 2,633,268 3,056,000 2,378,000 724,000Weighted-average price ($/bbl) $76.88 $76.93 $76.07 $71.76 $70.66 $68.36 $67.44Sold Calls(1) Hedged volume (bbls) 92,000 92,000 296,127 1,251,500 318,500 -- -- Weighted-average price ($/bbl) $105.00 $105.00 $88.69 $85.53 $80.03 $ -- $ -- Purchased Puts (net)(2) Hedged volume (bbls) 322,000 322,000 -- -- -- -- -- Weighted-average price ($/bbl) $50.00 $50.00 $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- Purchased Puts (net)(2) Hedged volume (bbls) -- -- 296,127 1,251,500 318,500 -- -- Weighted-average price ($/bbl) $ -- $ -- $60.00 $60.00 $65.00 $ -- $ -- Sold Puts (net)(2) Hedged volume (bbls) 46,000 46,000 -- -- -- -- -- Weighted-average price ($/bbl) $40.00 $40.00 $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- NWPL - Natural Gas purchases(3) Swaps Hedged volume (mmbtu) 3,680,000 3,680,000 13,380,000 3,040,000 -- -- -- Weighted-average price ($/mmbtu) $3.96 $3.96 $4.27 $4.26 $ -- $ -- $ --\n\n__________\n\n(1) Purchased calls and sold calls with the same strike price have been presented on a net basis.\n\n(2) Purchased puts and sold puts with the same strike price have been presented on a net basis.\n\n(3) The term \"NWPL\" is defined as Northwest Rocky Mountain Pipeline.\n\n(LOSSES) GAINS ON DERIVATIVES\n\nA summary of gains and losses on the derivatives included on the statements of operations is presented below:\n\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n\n2024 March 31,\n\n2024 June 30,\n\n2023 (unaudited)\n\n(in thousands)Realized (losses) on commodity derivatives: Realized (losses) on oil sales derivatives$(9,801) $(4,682) $(1,770)Realized (losses) on natural gas purchase derivatives (9,314) (4,412) (10,754)Total realized (losses) on derivatives$(19,115) $(9,094) $(12,524) Unrealized gains (losses) on commodity derivatives: Unrealized gains (losses) on oil sales derivatives$3,957 $(66,518) $22,641 Unrealized gains (losses) on natural gas purchase derivatives 6,672 (69) (3,270)Total unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives$10,629 $(66,587) $19,371 Total (losses) gains on derivatives$(8,486) $(75,681) $6,847\n\nE&P FIELD OPERATIONS\n\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 June 30, 2023 (unaudited)\n\n($ in per boe amounts)Expenses from field operations Lease operating expenses$23.47 $26.28 $23.17Electricity generation expenses 0.24 0.47 0.54Transportation expenses 0.45 0.46 0.46Total$24.16 $27.21 $24.17 Cash settlements paid for gas purchase hedges$4.05 $1.91 $4.56 E&P non-production revenues Electricity sales$1.60 $1.84 $1.30Transportation sales 0.02 0.03 0.02Total$1.62 $1.87 $1.32\n\nOverall, management assesses the efficiency of the Company's E&P field operations by considering core E&P operating expenses together with cogeneration, marketing and transportation activities. In particular, a core component of E&P operations in California is steam, which is used to lift heavy oil to the surface. The Company operates several cogeneration facilities to produce some of the steam needed in operations. In comparing the cost effectiveness of cogeneration plants against other sources of steam in operations, management considers the cost of operating the cogeneration plants, including the cost of the natural gas purchased to operate the facilities, against the value of the steam and electricity used in E&P field operations and the revenues received from sales of excess electricity to the grid. The Company strives to minimize the variability of its fuel gas costs for California steam operations with natural gas purchase hedges. Consequently, the efficiency of E&P field operations are impacted by the cash settlements received or paid from these derivatives. The Company also has contracts for the transportation of fuel gas from the Rockies, which has historically been cheaper than the California markets. With respect to transportation and marketing, management also considers opportunistic sales of incremental capacity in assessing the overall efficiencies of E&P operations.\n\nLease operating expenses include fuel, labor, field office, vehicle, supervision, maintenance, tools and supplies, and workover expenses. Electricity generation expenses include the portion of fuel, labor, maintenance, and tools and supplies from two of the Company's cogeneration facilities allocated to electricity generation expense; the remaining cogeneration expenses are included in lease operating expense. Transportation expenses relate to costs to transport the oil and gas that is produced within the Company's properties or moved to the market. Marketing expenses mainly relate to natural gas purchased from third parties that moves through gathering and processing systems and then is sold to third parties. Electricity revenue is from the sale of excess electricity from two of the Company's cogeneration facilities to a California utility company under long-term contracts at market prices. These cogeneration facilities are sized to satisfy the steam needs in their respective fields, but the corresponding electricity produced is more than the electricity that is currently required for the operations in those fields. Transportation sales relate to water and other liquids that transport on the Company's systems on behalf of third parties and marketing revenues represent sales of natural gas purchased from and sold to third parties.\n\nPRODUCTION STATISTICS\n\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 June 30, 2023Net Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Production Per Day(1): Oil (mbbl/d) California21.1 21.3 20.8Utah2.3 2.5 3.2Total oil23.4 23.8 24.0Natural gas (mmcf/d) California -- -- -- Utah8.9 7.9 9.2Total natural gas8.9 7.9 9.2NGLs (mbbl/d) California -- -- -- Utah0.4 0.3 0.4Total NGLs0.4 0.3 0.4Total Production (mboe/d)(2)25.3 25.4 25.9\n\n__________\n\n(1) Production represents volumes sold during the period. We also consume a portion of the natural gas we produce on lease to extract oil and gas.\n\n(2) Natural gas volumes have been converted to boe based on energy content of six mcf of gas to one bbl of oil. Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence. The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years. For example, in the three months ended June 30, 2024, the average prices of Brent oil and Henry Hub natural gas were $85.03 per bbl and $2.07 per mmbtu respectively.\n\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\n\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024June 30, 2023 (unaudited)\n\n(in thousands) Capital expenditures (1)(2)$42,325 $16,936 $21,895\n\n__________\n\n(1) Capital expenditures include capitalized overhead and interest and excludes acquisitions and asset retirement spending.\n\n(2) Capital expenditures for the three months ended June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023 included less than $1 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively, related to the well servicing and abandonment business.\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS\n\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) is not a measure of net income (loss), Adjusted Free Cash Flow is not a measure of cash flow, and Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of either net income (loss) or cash flow, in all cases, as determined by GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense; income taxes; depreciation, depletion, and amortization; derivative gains or losses net of cash received or paid for scheduled derivative settlements; impairments; stock compensation expense; and unusual and infrequent items. Our management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in assessing our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and is widely used by the industry and the investment community. The measure also allows our management to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results between periods without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We also use Adjusted EBITDA in planning our capital expenditure allocation to sustain production levels and to determine our strategic hedging needs aside from the hedging requirements of the 2021 RBL Facility.\n\nWe define Adjusted Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash flow from operations less regular fixed dividends and capital expenditures. In 2024, we updated the definition of Adjusted Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP measure, as cash flow from operations less regular fixed dividends and capital expenditures. This update better aligns with the full capital expenditure requirements of the Company. For 2023, Adjusted Free Cash Flow was defined as cash flow from operations less regular fixed dividends and maintenance capital. Management believes Adjusted Free Cash Flow may be useful in an investor analysis of our ability to generate cash from operating activities from our existing oil and gas asset base after maintaining the existing production volumes of that asset base to return capital to stockholders, fund further business expansion through acquisitions or investments in our existing asset base to increase production volumes and pay other non-discretionary expenses. Management also uses Adjusted Free Cash Flow as the primary metric to plan for future growth.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance, and it should not be inferred that the entire amount of Adjusted Free Cash Flow is available for variable dividends, debt or share repurchases, strategic acquisitions or other growth opportunities, or other discretionary expenditures, since we have mandatory debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from this measure.\n\nWe define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as net income (loss) adjusted for derivative gains or losses net of cash received or paid for scheduled derivative settlements, unusual and infrequent items, and the income tax expense or benefit of these adjustments using our statutory tax rate. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) excludes the impact of unusual and infrequent items affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably, including non-cash items such as derivative gains and losses. This measure is used by management when comparing results period over period. We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is useful to investors because it reflects how management evaluates the Company's ongoing financial and operating performance from period-to-period after removing certain transactions and activities that affect comparability of the metrics and are not reflective of the Company's core operations. We believe this also makes it easier for investors to compare our period-to-period results with our peers.\n\nWe define Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses as general and administrative expenses adjusted for non-cash stock compensation expense and unusual and infrequent costs. Management believes Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses is useful because it allows us to more effectively compare our performance from period to period. We believe Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses is useful to investors because it reflects how management evaluates the Company's ongoing general and administrative expenses from period-to-period after removing non-cash stock compensation, as well as unusual or infrequent costs that affect comparability of the metrics and are not reflective of the Company's administrative costs. We believe this also makes it easier for investors to compare our period-to-period results with our peers.\n\nWhile Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses are non-GAAP measures, the amounts included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses were computed in accordance with GAAP. These measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, income and liquidity measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than income and liquidity measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance, such as our cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable and depletable assets. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nADJUSTED EBITDA\n\nThe following tables present reconciliations of the GAAP financial measures of net income (loss) and net cash provided (used) by operating activities to the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA, as applicable, for each of the periods indicated.\n\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 June 30, 2023 (unaudited)\n\n(in thousands)Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation:Net (loss) income$(8,769) $(40,084) $25,770 Add (Subtract): Interest expense 10,050 9,140 8,794 Income tax (benefit) expense (3,326) (13,900) 10,616 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 42,843 42,831 39,755 Impairment of oil and gas properties 43,980 -- -- Losses (gains) on derivatives 8,486 75,681 (6,847)Net cash (paid) for scheduled derivative settlements (19,115) (9,094) (12,524)Other operating (income) (3,204) (133) (1,033)Stock compensation expense(1) 1,990 385 3,552 Acquisition costs(2) 1,394 2,617 972 Non-recurring costs(3) -- 1,091 -- Adjusted EBITDA$74,329 $68,534 $69,055 Net cash provided by operating activities$70,891 $27,273 $62,538 Add (Subtract): Cash interest payments 1,395 15,256 1,004 Cash income tax payments 491 -- 670 Acquisition costs(2) 1,394 2,617 -- Non-recurring costs(3) -- 1,091 -- Changes in operating assets and liabilities - working capital(4) 3,293 22,543 6,065 Other operating (income) - cash portion(5) (3,135) (246) (1,222)Adjusted EBITDA$74,329 $68,534 $69,055\n\n__________\n\n(1) Decrease in the first quarter of 2024 is the result of stock award forfeitures.\n\n(2) Includes legal and other professional expenses related to various transactions activities.\n\n(3) In 2024, non-recurring costs included workforce reduction costs in the first quarter.\n\n(4) Changes in other assets and liabilities consists of working capital and various immaterial items.\n\n(5) Represents the cash portion of other operating (income) from the income statement, net of the non-cash portion in the cash flow statement.\n\nADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of operating cash flow to the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted Free Cash Flow for each of the periods indicated.

Such an offer would be a 14% premium to International Papers' closing price on Monday.\n\nThe move comes less than a month after International Paper agreed to buy UK packaging rival DS Smith Plc for 5.8 billion ($7.3 billion). Suzano is in talks with potential lenders to finance its transaction, the terms of which would require International Paper to abandon its deal with DS Smith, according to Reuters.\n\nInternational Paper is likely to reject Suzano's offer as insufficient, the report said.\n\nSuzano said in a filing that there is no official document or celebration of any agreement from the company and that no decision has been made regarding a possible deal.\n\nMemphis-based International Paper said in a statement Tuesday that it had no comment on rumors or speculation. The company said it is focused on completing its combination with DS Smith, which offers a unique and highly compelling opportunity to create significant shareholder value on top of its core plan.\n\nThe paper and packaging sector is in the consolidation phase. Last year, Smurfit Kappa Group Plc agreed to buy WestRock Co. to create an Irish-American powerhouse.\n\nThe industry benefited from a surge in demand for deliveries during the pandemic as consumers under lockdown ordered more goods online. Since then, it has weathered a slowdown as e-commerce returned to more normal levels, weighing on gains across the industry. Profits at International Paper shrank to their lowest level in more than a decade last year.\n\nA bid for International Paper would be the latest attempt by a foreign company to capture a US giant, following the controversial takeover by Nippon Steel Corp. of United States Steel Corp. International Paper was founded more than a century ago in 1898 through the combination of 17 pulp and paper mills.\n\nIt would also be the biggest cross-border acquisition by a Brazilian company since Vale SA bought Inco Ltd. in 2007 for about 17 billion dollars.\n\nFor Suzano, the move would mark a first step towards a long-awaited internationalization push and allow it to diversify its packaging operations and enter the US market. The company controls almost a third of global capacity for hardwood pulp, a key ingredient in tissue and writing paper that is also used in some absorbent products.\n\nSuzano is currently undergoing a change in management, with long-time chief executive Walter Schalka to be replaced by Joao Fernandez de Abreu.\n\nWhile International Paper trades at a higher price-to-earnings ratio than Suzano, the Brazilian company has had a higher market value than its US rival for nearly a year.\n\nShares of International Paper rose as much as 12% in New York trading, the biggest intraday gain since March 2020, before closing up 5.2%. Suzano ended 12% lower in Sao Paulo in its biggest loss in more than four years. DS Smith fell sharply in London trading and then erased most of the decline.\n\nSuzanos dollar bonds fell along the curve following the news. Notes due 2029 fell as much as 4.7 cents on the dollar to 98.8 cents on Tuesday, according to Trace data.\n\nEveryone was waiting to hear how Suzano is planning to finance the acquisition and how the rating agencies will react, said Roger Horn, senior emerging markets strategist at Mariva Capital Markets. At first glance, it doesn't make much sense, as management has long emphasized that it benefits from highly competitive cash costs in Brazil, especially compared to its North American peers.\n\nSuzano's pulp business is theoretically more cyclical than its IP packaging business, so one could argue that this potential combination would help Suzano not only increase scale but also reduce earnings volatility, analysts said. Barclays including Gaurav Jain in a note to clients.\n\nHowever, the deal would significantly worsen Suzano's debt metrics, making it unviable. If anything, we believe this could make IP even more determined to complete the DS Smith transaction, the analysts wrote.\n\n-With the help of Vincius Andrade.\n\n(Updates with Suzano's comment on the fifth paragraph)", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DS_Smith", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DS Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Paper", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Paper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzano", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suzano"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Suzano"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Packaging and labeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(paper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pulp (paper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.A._(corporation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.A.

One source suggested that International Paper could reject Suzano's offer as inadequate.\n\nDuring a securities filing, Suzano commented that it has not signed an agreement with International Paper for a potential business combination; nor has its management made any decision regarding a potential deal.\n\nReuters says that International Paper's shares have risen by as much as 12%, which gives the company a market capitalization of around $13.5 billion (\u20ac125,589,150,000); its shares are thought to have closed up by over 5%.\n\nMeanwhile, Suzano's market value is placed at around 77.6 billion reais (\u20ac142,277,649,756.80), yet its shares have reportedly closed down by more than 12% in Brazil. A 39% decline was reported in its fourth-quarter net profit in 2023, which Reuters attributes to lower pulp prices and the resultant impact on revenue.\n\nReportedly, Suzano is considering lining up debt financing to support its bid for International Paper. A combination is expected to help Suzano expand its contribution to the European packaging sector and deliver annual pre-tax cash synergies of at least $514 million (\u20ac478,169,060).\n\nInternational Paper has declined to comment on the matter in favour of completing its deal for DS Smith.\n\nIn a statement, International Paper said: \"The IP team, led by new CEO Andy Silvernail, is executing on business strategies and pursuing commercial and cost improvement initiatives across the portfolio to achieve best-in-class profit margins and significant earnings growth. In addition, as industry conditions continue to improve, IP will come out of a cyclical bottom for earnings.\"\n\nLate last year, Smurfit Kappa and WestRock entered discussions for a merger to create Smurfit WestRock; the combined company was anticipated to be worth around $20 billion (\u20ac186,039,000,00).\n\nThe merger was agreed a week later. Shareholders were urged to voice their own agreement on the matter, with the combination scheduled to be completed in the second quarter of the 2024 calendar year, subject to customary closing conditions like shareholder and regulatory approvals.\n\nIf you liked this story, you might also enjoy:\n\nThe Brief: How viable is biorecycling for plastics?\n\nReport: How the top brands are progressing on packaging sustainability\n\nThe Brief: Using ocean-bound plastic in packaging - how, why and should we?", "source": {"uri": "packagingeurope.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Packaging Europe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DS_Smith", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DS Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Paper", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Paper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzano", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suzano"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Suzano"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondi", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mondi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(paper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pulp (paper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_real", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazilian real"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smurfit_Kappa", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smurfit Kappa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WestRock", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WestRock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Packaging and labeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://d2wrwj382xgrci.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1120xAny/5/8/2/14582_pe_suzano_947310.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551244", "eventUri": "eng-9551244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

This offer, as per unidentified sources, is considered insufficient to sway the Board's decision, especially considering the stock traded at $41 just two months ago.\n\nAfter dipping on worse-than-expected earnings in late April, as well as on the report that insiders were selling a significant amount of shares, IP stock has bounced back significantly this month as the arrival of CEO Andrew Silvernail boosted sentiment back into the stock, propelling it to a 13% jump month-to-date.\n\nAnother issue standing in the way of a Suzano/IP deal is the latter's agreed buyout of London-based DS Smith (OTC: DITHF ) (LON: SMDS ) for $10 billion, officially agreed upon in mid-April. If finalized, the deal would create a company substantially above Suzano's financial reach, which is why the Brazilian company will allegedly propose the breakup of the agreement as one of the clauses of its IP bid.\n\nHowever, the breakup clause celebrated in the April agreement implies a $221 million breakup fee, which would need to be paid up in cash by Suzano itself.\n\nThe Brazilian company's debt currently accounts for around 60% of total liabilities under a nearly 6.5% real rate environment in Brazil. This implies a 3X leverage to the current price, which would be raised to 5.3X if the company seals the deal at $42 a share, significantly rising as IP's per-share premium moves northward.\n\nThese numbers put a very low ceiling on any bid price rises, as every dollar added to IP's stock price would significantly constrain Suzano's balance sheet. Usual premium prices for paid-for common shareholders at a takeover tend to vary between 15-25%, which, at current valuation, would bring IP's price anywhere between $45-$49.\n\nAnalysts consulted by Investing.com say that the CEO's new plan would be to push the stock to the high $50s or $60s, which would imply a north of $5 billion market share rise for IP, placing it way out of Suzano's league.\n\nIn fact, worried by the company's ballooning debt level in case the deal breaks, even at a $42/share price, Suzano stock plunged a hefty 12% when the news that the company is considering the merger broke across the media.\n\nThe next option for Suzano would be to include shares along with cash in the deal - given that the original bid is for an all-cash takeover.\n\nHowever, that offer would also be significantly limited as the company's indebted balance sheet and the high cyclicality of the pulp business would make such an offer highly unattractive to IP's Board, particularly if it includes a high amount of shares.\n\nSell-side analysts at Jefferies agree that the deal would be highly unlikely given the current framework: \"It's hard for us to imagine IP would look to sell to Suzano unless the offer was significantly upsized from here, which Suzano does not appear to have the balance sheet,\" says a report released right after the deal speculation news.\n\nSources consulted by Investing.com also believe that the IP/DS Smith current merger has a very high potential for both parties involved, which would be another dealbreaker for IP's Board, which would be more inclined to consider moving on with the current potential.\n\nCould the Deal Go Through Under a Different Framework?\n\nBrazilian-based Ita\u00fa BBA sees potential in the deal despite the enormous hurdles standing in its way. According to the bank, \"A potential deal with IP would be aligned with Suzano's recent speech (details here and here), as the company has been vocal about considering M&A expansions in the paper business in North America and Europe as potential growth avenues.\"\n\nThe bank also believes that \"valuation post-deal appears appealing.\" \"An all-cash combination between Suzano and International Paper would result in a USD 7 -7.5 billion EBITDA giant, with an EV of roughly $44 billion (considering a $15 billion offering for IP's equity),\" it concluded.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, analysts at Jefferies believe that the more likely outcome for the current speculation is opening up a \"dialogue on IP selling its pulp business rather than the entire company\" - given the former is the main focus of Suzano's move.\n\nThe research company also hints at the possibility of the family that owns Suzano stepping in with a cash infusion that would potentially change the game.", "source": {"uri": "in.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzano", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suzano"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Suzano"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investing.com", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Investing.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuka_International_Racing_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suzuka International Racing Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DS_Smith", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DS Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzano_Papel_e_Celulose", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suzano Papel e Celulose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Paper", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Paper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(paper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pulp (paper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liability_(financial_accounting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liability (financial accounting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over-the-counter (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest,_taxes,_depreciation,_and_amortization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mergers and acquisitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ita\u00fa_Unibanco", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ita\u00fa Unibanco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/akapi-images/800x450/f30dc91b111cd09e871241e191c91597_w_800_h_450.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551244", "eventUri": "eng-9551244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Usual premium prices for paid-for common shareholders at a takeover tend to vary between 15-25%, which, at current valuation, would bring IP's price anywhere between $45-$49.\n\nAnalysts consulted by Investing.com say that the CEO's new plan would be to push the stock to the high $50s or $60s, which would imply a north of $5 billion market share rise for IP, placing it way out of Suzano's league.\n\nIn fact, worried by the company's ballooning debt level in case the deal breaks, even at a $42/share price, Suzano stock plunged a hefty 12% when the news that the company is considering the merger broke across the media.\n\nThe next option for Suzano would be to include shares along with cash in the deal - given that the original bid is for an all-cash takeover.\n\nHowever, that offer would also be significantly limited as the company's indebted balance sheet and the high cyclicality of the pulp business would make such an offer highly unattractive to IP's Board, particularly if it includes a high amount of shares.\n\nSell-side analysts at Jefferies agree that the deal would be highly unlikely given the current framework: \"It's hard for us to imagine IP would look to sell to Suzano unless the offer was significantly upsized from here, which Suzano does not appear to have the balance sheet,\" says a report released right after the deal speculation news.\n\nSources consulted by Investing.com also believe that the IP/DS Smith current merger has a very high potential for both parties involved, which would be another dealbreaker for IP's Board, which would be more inclined to consider moving on with the current potential.\n\nBrazilian-based Ita\u00fa BBA sees potential in the deal despite the enormous hurdles standing in its way. According to the bank, \"A potential deal with IP would be aligned with Suzano's recent speech (details here and here), as the company has been vocal about considering M&A expansions in the paper business in North America and Europe as potential growth avenues.\"\n\nThe bank also believes that \"valuation post-deal appears appealing.\" \"An all-cash combination between Suzano and International Paper would result in a USD 7 -7.5 billion EBITDA giant, with an EV of roughly $44 billion (considering a $15 billion offering for IP's equity),\" it concluded.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, analysts at Jefferies believe that the more likely outcome for the current speculation is opening up a \"dialogue on IP selling its pulp business rather than the entire company\" - given the former is the main focus of Suzano's move.\n\nThe research company also hints at the possibility of the family that owns Suzano stepping in with a cash infusion that would potentially change the game.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzano", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suzano"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Suzano"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investing.com", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Investing.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DS_Smith", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DS Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzano_Papel_e_Celulose", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suzano Papel e Celulose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Paper", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Paper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(paper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pulp (paper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liability_(financial_accounting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liability (financial accounting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest,_taxes,_depreciation,_and_amortization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mergers and acquisitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ita\u00fa_Unibanco", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ita\u00fa Unibanco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEAB20I9_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551244", "eventUri": "eng-9551244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Additionally, the bank mentions typically higher multiples for paper and packaging companies compared to pure pulp players, which could lead to a revaluation of the company in the future, as well as less exposure to the Chinese economy.\n\nNevertheless, the analysts point out that investors see excessive payment as the main risk, and limitations in synergies, as the assets would not overlap. With the indicated price in the news, the net debt/EBITDA ratio for the new company would range between 4-4.5x, \"which could pressure Suzano's equity value if the market does not attribute a higher multiple for the company,\" adds Ita\u00fa BBA.\n\nThe analysts' estimates for the combination point to a considered giant EBITDA between $7 billion to $7.5 billion, and a value around $44 billion, implying an EV/EBITDA in 2024 and 2025 close to 6.0x, which the bank considers attractive.\n\n\"If the market attributes a 6.5x multiple as \"fair\" (which we think is low), we see ~50% upside from current prices. That said, we acknowledge that the deleveraging story post-Cerrado would then be postponed,\" concludes the bank, which has an outperform recommendation, equivalent to a buy, with a target price of R$75.\n\nSuzano denies formalizing an offer\n\nMeanwhile, Suzano has stated that there is no formal document or binding agreement regarding a possible business combination with International Paper. However, it stated that it \"is continuously analyzing market opportunities and investments aligned with its strategy.\"\n\nSuzano on InvestingPro\n\nSuzano operates with a significant debt burden, and analysts expect lower profits this year, according to InvestingPro, Investing.com's premium platform. However, the Protips, AI-driven insights based on fundamental indicators, indicate that management has been aggressively buying back shares, and the company is traded at a low earnings multiple.\n\nThe financial health of Suzano is considered to be performing well, with a score of four, on a metric ranging from one to five.\n\nThe fair price of the company is evaluated at R$69.23, with a potential upside of 31.9%, according to 13 investment models.

And you know what? Respect. We need more all-knowing professionals like that who are dedicated to their work and want to help all of us drive as safely and economically as possible. So it\u2019s no surprise that Poisson, co-owner of Brighton Auto YP in Chicago, recently posted a 4-minute monologue on TikTok about the different grades and viscosities of motor oil being used today, and why thinner blends rated at 0w8 or 0w16 are seen as more favorable for automakers. Are thinner oils better? The short answer: Thinner blends make engines run more easily than thicker blends, which means vehicles running those formulations get rated for higher mileage. But Poisson cautions there\u2019s a downside to using thinner oil. \u201cOil has more than just one property. It\u2019s not just lubricating. It\u2019s also protecting the the engine, conditioning the seals, and also removing heat from areas that it can as much as possible. Thin oils do great with fuel economy and removing heat, but they have weak film thickness under more performance-based applications and more severe driving. Thicker oils don\u2019t remove heat as fast, but they have a better film thickness, which is to protect the rotating assembly better.\u201d Add this lesson to the list of things\u2014like taxes, good mental health practices, and cooking\u2014that I would\u2019ve been better off learning in school, instead of how to calculate the length of sides of a right triangle. Poisson notes that federal fuel economy standards for automakers have played a big role in the push toward lighter blends of motor oil, since gaining a few extra miles from every gallon of fuel means there\u2019s fewer costly engineering and efficiency steps they have to work into their manufacturing processes. Of course, that could wind up costing owners in the end if there\u2019s less protection happening around various engine parts. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s almost not bad to go thicker, but it\u2019s almost always bad to go thinner than what\u2019s recommended for the vehicle. Also, why would they tell us that we shouldn\u2019t go from a 5W20 to a 5W50 on that Mustang, theoretically, because if you put a thicker oil on your engine, it\u2019s going to mess with the timing and the VCT components and everything else, and you don\u2019t want that,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of times when people say stuff like that, they\u2019re full of it. The vehicle is going to be perfectly fine by running a thicker oil. Just monitor what\u2019s going on and keep a feel for how your vehicle is doing.\u201d Commenters on the clip had plenty of thoughts on Poisson\u2019s view in support of thicker oils. \u201cI\u2019ve run 5w30 in my 0w20 recommended car for 230,000 miles,\u201d wrote one rebellious driver. Then there\u2019s this from a vocal fan of synthetic oils: \u201c5w30 in everything that requires any 0w oils I been running dextrous 5w30 synthetic in all my cars.\u201d @fordbossme Replying to @howiemchowerton \u266c original sound \u2013 Rich And there\u2019s this from someone who seems to see things the same way Poisson does: \u201cSo run these thinner oils for better economy and rebuild the internals sooner. A lot can be said about longevity. Even 0w-20 seems a step backwards.\u201d The Daily Dot has reached out to Poisson via phone.", "summary": "<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://uploads.dailydot.com/2024/06/engine-oils.jpg?auto=compress&amp;fm=pjpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"Mechanic reveals why newer cars are using such different types of oil\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" /></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>We know firsthand from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/news/how-to-take-off-stuck-lugnuts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">talking with</a>&nbsp;veteran repair supervisor Rich Poisson that the guy probably thinks about nothing but cars, 24/7.

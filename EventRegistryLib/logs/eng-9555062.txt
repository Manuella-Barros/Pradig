Springsteen wants us to be true to memory, ideals and the essence of the departed. He plays it like a revival tent show. This is no time to backslide. He wants the hands in the air, all the hearts on the line.\n\nHe follows with Lonesome Day, Prove It All Night and Ghosts. There's a brass section, a choir and the cherished E Street faces. Springsteen wears a black waistcoat, a white shirt and cherry-red Doc Martens boots. His presence is astounding.\n\nAs expected, he's not going to say much until the band gets revving, an hour into the show. But the songs say plenty, and there's a great pivot in the evening when The Promised Land is revealed.\n\nThe E Street Band has been active for half a century. The band leader will celebrate his 75th birthday in September, yet he looks ring-fit and eager. Springsteen and his band still play three-hour shows, pulling favourites and rare tunes out of the songbook and manifesting a joy that's genuine.\n\nBelfast returns the warmth. It's his first show in the North since 2013, and it's a delight to hear the return of Hungry Heart and Backstreets. When he sings Spirit in the Night you remember the debt that young Bruce owed to Van Morrison's lyrical soul. Later, the mouth-organ riffology of She's the One appears to mutate into Morrison's Mystic Eyes.\n\nMax Weinberg hits the snare drum with an emphatic thump on The Rising. Jake Clemons is playing sax, throwing shapes with Springsteen and being the worthy successor to his late uncle Clarence.\n\n[ Passion, booze, madness and comradeship: Bruce Springsteen's special relationship with Ireland ]\n\nThe final 10 songs are momentous, and the 18-piece ensemble does not falter. Steven Van Zandt throws the repartee around on Glory Days, while Thunder Road steers into an audience walkabout by the pit, as the singer collects trinkets and embraces the faithful.\n\nFifty years ago to the day, Springsteen and the E Street Band opened for Bonnie Raitt at the Harvard Square Theatre, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The music journalist (and future Springsteen manager) Jon Landau was at the gig and wrote up the ridiculous piece of rock lore: \"I saw rock and roll future, and its name is Bruce Springsteen.\" Yet many of those gathered in the early summer glow of Belfast will concur with the declaration of 1974. He has prevailed.\n\nYou want Springsteen to be tireless, to carry us over uncertain times once more. But he also knows that the gig is finite. Hence the tone of his 2020 album, Letter to You, wreathed around loss and farewells.\n\nWhich is how he leaves Belfast, just his voice, an acoustic guitar and a last deal of generosity. He sings I'll See You in my Dreams. He takes us quietly but resolutely into the night. Cherish your benediction from the Boss.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He showed it off to fans on a May 8 hype reel for the band's Thursday, May 9, show in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\n\nSpringsteen initially thought the little guy was a dinosaur.\n\n\"We're coming to get you now, first show in Wales and we are going to rock you to the ground!\" says Springsteen backstage at Cardiff's Principality Stadium in the reel. \"This little dinosaur is going to help me.\"\n\nCut to the next day.\n\n\"This is the morning after our first show in Cardiff, Wales.

And his pointing was right in between Pauline and me -- so at baby Draig. Well, then Bruce came off the main stage, walked along his fans.\n\n\"All of a sudden he stopped and kind of grabbed the baby Draig out of my hands. It felt like how children are taking/'grabbing' something from another child when they really like the toy of the other one. As a mother I know that kind of enthusiastic, 'childish' [behavior] very well. I love it. It's authentic, it's pure, it's real (heart emoji).\"\n\nFlemminks and her crew filmed a Springsteen-style hype reel at Principality Stadium before the show that features an appearance by baby Draig.\n\n\"I think and feel because Bruce is himself so real, so pure and authentic that he recognized something pure in the baby dragon,\" Flemminks said.\n\nThe show in Wales was the first of a string of European shows for Springsteen and the E Street Band that run through late July.\n\nSubscribe to app.com for the latest on the New Jersey music scene.\n\nChris Jordan, a Jersey Shore native, covers entertainment and features for the USA Today Network New Jersey.

A big part of it all is hope: Better Days, The Promised Land, getting over anything through the power of soulful rock'n'roll. It's either that or loss: the melancholy of The River, his acoustic ode to departed friends 'Last Man Standing'. \"Can you feel the spirit?' he asked, going into testifying gospel mode for 'Spirit in the Night', before leading a mass singalong of the old favourite 'Hungry Heart'.\n\nREAD MORE: Costa drive-thru opens at new retail park on the edge of Bristol\n\nREAD MORE: Starbucks to open new coffee shop next to Bristol Hippodrome\n\nThe three-hour, 29-song setlist opened with a deep cut in the form of 'So Young And In Love', an outtake from the 1974 recording sessions for 'Born To Run' that finally saw a release as part of the 1998 box set 'Tracks'. It was the song's first performance since 2013.\n\nBacked by the quite brilliant E-Street band his songs played live take on a life of their own played with jaw-dropping intensity and power, almost like a religious experience, worshipping at the Church of Bruce.\n\nAt the start of his European tour at Principality Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, Springsteen opened with the wonderfully obscure tune which included the line \"rat traps filled with soul crusaders,\" which he later re-worked into the Born to Run song \"Night.\"\n\nThe surprises in Cardiff continued six songs later when he played the Lucky Town song \"Better Days\" for the first time since 2017. Springsteen also responded to a sign request and broke out \"If I Was The Priest,\" a fan favourite from 1971. The E Street Band recorded it in 2020 for Letter To You, but they only played it three times last year.\n\nThe other notable moments in Cardiff were the first performances of 'The River' and 'Born in the U.S.A.' this year. The latter song rarely surfaces on this side of the Atlantic these days. It was played once in the States in 2023 and 22 times in Europe. On the 2016/17 River tour, it was played at four American gigs and 22 overseas ones.\n\nBruce and band powered from song to song with little or no introduction. Songs like 'No Surrender', 'Backstreets', and 'Because the Night', were anthemic and incredibly uplifting whist his control throughout, changing tempo and pace showed what a great and iconic performer he's become. This was so raw and alive, from Springsteen's sandpaper roar on 'Wrecking Ball' to Van Zandt's squealing guitar on 'Thunder Road', your throat and fingers hurt just thinking about it.\n\nHis mega band consisting of E-Street Band stalwarts Nils Lofgren, Roy Bitton, Gary Tallent, Steve Van Zandt and Jake Clemons (nephew of the late Clarence Clemons, former E-Street giant) were what you would expect from a band with so much experience and talent, a joy to listen to as they superbly supported their leader through a high-octane rip-roaring evening.\n\nHis cover of the Commodores 'Nightshift', slotted effortlessly in amongst Springsteen classic like the stunning 'The River', 'The Promised Land' and 'Spirit in the Night', and then a wonderful middle section which included 'Backstreets', 'She's the One', 'Wrecking Ball' and 'The Rising'.\n\nPerhaps the greatest live performer the rock era has ever witnessed, Springsteen will turn 75 this year, and is coming back from a health scare that forced him to postpone this second leg of his world tour.\n\nA thoughtfully conceived set that locates a narrative of remembrance and commemoration Cardiff was treated to a final romp through the runaway anthem 'Badlands', the glorious and my all-time favourite 'Thunder Road', the conflicted patriotism of 'Born in the USA', showstopper 'Born To Run', 'Bobby Jean', 'Dancing in the Dark', 'Tenth Avenue Freeze Out' and a riotous cover of 'Twist and Shout' with the house lights on so that the dancing, singing, audience became as much a part of the experience as the band.\n\nThe last 30 minutes of a quite splendid show was one of the best I'd ever seen with both band and crowd bonding for what was an electric finish, from one of rock's true greats.\n\nAnd he ends the show alone again, strapping on an acoustic guitar to play 'I'll See You In My Dreams', another song inspired by the loss of a friend, his voice almost a whisper as he conducts the crowd in the final chorus. It's a touching moment. A reminder of the transience of time, and the importance of keeping loved ones close.\n\n\"I remember you my friend/ And though you're gone and my heart's been emptied it seems/ For death is not the end / I'll see you in my dreams ,\" Bruce Springsteen crooned at the end of another epic set. We should count ourselves lucky to still be seeing him in the flesh. Every Springsteen gig feels like the greatest show on earth, and this was no exception.", "source": {"uri": "bristolpost.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bristol Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Springsteen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_River_(Bruce_Springsteen_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The River (Bruce Springsteen song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Promised_Land_(Bruce_Springsteen_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Promised Land (Bruce Springsteen song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_in_the_Night", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spirit in the Night"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_Heart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungry Heart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gospel music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Surrender_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "No Surrender (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_in_the_U.S.A._(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Born in the U.S.A.

Not only is The Boss a uniquely gifted songwriter who covers poignant and culturally pertinent topics, but he is also a dynamic showman capable of getting the hips shaking and arms swaying. After all, Springsteen learned from the very best as a lifelong fan of Elvis Presley and an early Beatles convert.\n\nAs a solo artist, Springsteen's showmanship is comparable to that of Presley, whom he saw performing on television as a child. \"I saw Elvis on TV, and when I first saw Elvis, I was nine, but I was a little young, tried to play the guitar, but it didn't work out, I put it away,\" Springsteen once told Rolling Stone. Perhaps he was a little young at the time. However, a few years in, The Beatles tipped the scales and sealed Springsteen's fate. \"The keeper was in 1964, 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand',\" he added.\n\nAfter becoming fascinated with The Beatles' early hits, \"it was nothing but rock 'n' roll and guitars\" for Springsteen. However, the four-piece from Liverpool wasn't the be-all and end-all. In The Beatles' wake, British invasion stalwarts like The Kinks, The Rolling Stones and The Who rose to global prominence and further demonstrated the scope of rock 'n' roll.\n\nSpringsteen was particularly enthusiastic about The Who. The London-born band emerged with era-defying hits like 'My Generation' and 'Can't Explain', stabilising with groundbreaking rock operas and heavy live shows precursory to the punk and metal genres. The band boasted the lyrical power of Roger Daltrey, the percussive excellence of Keith Moon and the unmatched bass virtuosity of John Entwistle. However, as a guitarist, Springsteen was always most impressed by bandleader Pete Townshend.\n\nIn 2015, Springsteen presented Townshend with the Stevie Ray Vaughan Award for his work for MusiCares charity. During his speech, the American singer remembered that the first rock concert he attended was a stop on The Who's 1967 US tour. \"I was a young pimply-faced teenager who managed to scrap enough together to go see my first rock concert ever,\" he recalled. \"Pete and The Who were young pimply-faced teenagers with a record contract, a tour and a rude, aggressive magic.\"\n\nAlthough the set was markedly short, Springsteen remembered being entranced by the infectious energy and Townshend's famous destructive tendencies. \"The Who came out, and they played for probably a little more than 30 minutes,\" he continued. \"Pete, in a cloud of smoke, demolished his guitar, bashing it over and over into the floor and his amplifier. All I knew, for some reason, this music and the demolishing of all these perfectly fine instruments filled me with incredible joy and I never looked back.\"\n\nAs the 1970s dawned, Springsteen set about establishing his own music career with an early incarnation of the E Street Band. As he made his first steps, the Boss felt the spirit of The Who coursing in his veins. \"As I grew older, The Who's music seemed to grow with me, the sexual frustration, politics, identity,\" Springsteen noted. \"These things course through my veins with every concurring Who album. I always found myself there somewhere in their music.\"\n\nTowards the end of his speech, Springsteen opined that Townshend \"is the greatest rhythm guitarist of all time.\" For Springsteen, this was important because The Who showed him that he didn't need to focus on lead guitar. \"You don't have to play any lead,\" he said. \"It's an amazing thing to behold. Pete managed to take the dirty business of rock and roll and somehow make it spiritual and turn it into a quest. He may hate this, but he identified the place where it was noble, and he wasn't afraid to go there.\"\n\nWatch Bruce Springsteen perform 'My Generation with the surviving members of The Who at the

Normally, probably not. But if you're spending a Sunday night with Bruce Springsteen at Cardiff's Principality Stadium? Hell yes.\n\nRolling up for his latest European tour, the Boss is in fine fettle following a health scare that prompted thoughts he wasn't invincible after all. Forced to postpone dates last September due to peptic ulcers -- or a \"motherfucker of a bellyache\" as he put it -- Springsteen, who turns 75 this year, was fearful he might never sing again.\n\nAfter a six month timeout his return to the stage brings with it a question: might this be the last time we see him rip it up with the E-Street Band? On this evidence, that seems unlikely. The show clocks in at a mammoth 29 songs, with its musings on mortality reborn as something joyous in songs such as the opener So Young And In Love, a 1974 curio that hasn't seen action since 2013, coincidentally the last time Springsteen was in the city.\n\nGreeting it, the audience's resounding cheers are almost loud enough to compete with a thunderously upbeat 17-piece configuration of the E-Street Band. Other tour debuts are given to Better Days, from 1992's 'Lucky Town', and If I Was The Priest, another early '70s composition that was eventually given a modern sheen and released on 2020's 'Letter To You'. Later on, there's a ruminative run through the true story of The River, the title track from the 1980 record of the same name.\n\nThe first section of the show offers up a mix of contemporary selections, including the brooding Lonesome Day, from 2002's 'The Rising', and 2020's Ghosts, a haunting message to departed bandmates, alongside '70s and '80s favourites such as No Surrender and Prove It All Night. The latter finds Springsteen leaning on Jake Clemons' shoulder in a touching nod to the pose he struck with the saxophonist's uncle Clarence for the 'Born to Run' cover art.\n\nGreeting and high-fiving fans at the barrier with the stamina of a man in the prime of his life, a tireless Springsteen runs through Darlington County before some thrilling harmonica solos during The Promised Land. Before one song ends, his cry of \"one, two, three, four\" summons the next without pausing for breath. Setlist regulars Spirit In The Night, from his 1973 debut, and Hungry Heart follow before a grandstanding rendition of My City Of Ruins.\n\nLed by Roy Bittan's keys and solos from Clemons, the soulful Nightshift brings the E-Street Choir and E-Street Horns together for a poignant cover of the Commodores hit, heard on Springsteen's most recent album 'Only The Strong Survive'. He wistfully croons about soul greats Marvin Gaye and Jackie Wilson, joined on the ramp by backing singer Curtis King, offering a momentary breather.\n\nThe wildly talented Nils Lofgren provides one of the evening's most memorable moments, shredding on the anthemic and uplifting Because The Night, spinning in circles while showing off his flashy genius on the fretboard. The last quarter kicks on from here, with the mass sing-along for Badlands providing a moment most artists would reserve as a set-closing salvo. Springsteen instead uses it as a launch pad for the show's final cavalcade of back-to-back classics.\n\nWith the house lights on, Thunder Road, Born In The USA, Born To Run, Dancing In The Dark -- some of the best rock songs of all time -- are delivered in typically exhilarating, breathless fashion. Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out, complete with images of the late Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici displayed on the big screen, precede a heartfelt and meaningful acoustic finale of I'll See You in My Dreams.\n\nLike the earlier Last Man Standing -- administered solo as a tribute to George Theiss, Springsteen's bandmate from his teenage rock and roll band The Castiles -- the idea of saying goodbye looms large in each chord that rings out. Not yet, Boss. Not yet.\n\nBruce Springsteen Upcoming Tour Dates are as follows:", "source": {"uri": "stereoboard.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stereoboard.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

This is the first time audiences have heard Chalamet's impression of the iconic Dylan voice.\n\nA Complete Unknown trailer\n\nThe trailer begins with Dylan (Chalamet) being introduced to a small crowd.\n\n\"A few months back, my friend Woody Guthrie and I, we met a young man. He dropped in on us out of nowhere and played us a song,\" the man said. \"In that moment, we got a feeling we were getting a glimpse of the future.\"\n\nChalamet performing \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\" follows. His voice sounds remarkably close to Dylan's with a hint of Chalamet's own.\n\nThe trailer does not offer too many shots of Chalamet head-on as Dylan. Most shots are from the side or behind him.\n\nDuring a montage, Dylan is initially falling for Sylvie Russo (Elle Fanning). Monica Barbaro's Joan Baez is also shown during the sequence of shots with a love triangle being implied. A quick glimpse of Edward Norton as Pete Seeger can also be seen.\n\nBy the end of the trailer, Chalamet has completely transformed into Bob Dylan. He dons the iconic sunglasses with the frizzy hair as he smokes.\n\nHis only spoken word of dialogue in the trailer comes at the very end. Chalamet's Dylan has just performed a song for Seeger and his family.\n\n\"That's all I've got so far,\" he says in a raspy voice to an impressed audience.\n\n\"Good start,\" one of the young girls listening replies.\n\nAs the title card pops up, the beginning of \"Like a Rolling Stone\" can be heard. Of course, that is the song the biopic got its name from.\n\nWhat is the Bob Dylan biopic?\n\nThe Bob Dylan biopic, A Complete Unknown, is James Mangold's latest movie. He co-wrote the script with Jay Cocks. The movie is based on the 2015 book Dylan Goes Electric! by Elijah Waid.\n\nIt will depict Dylan's transition to electrically amplified music and the controversy surrounding the move. Judging by the trailer, his love life will also be touched on in the biopic.\n\nThe official synopsis, per Searchlight, reads: \"Set in the influential New York music scene of the early 60s, A Complete Unknown follows 19-year-old Minnesota musician Bob Dylan's (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) meteoric rise as a folk singer to concert halls and the top of the charts - his songs and mystique becoming a worldwide sensation - culminating in his groundbreaking electric rock and roll performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965.\"\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet stars in the movie and is credited as a producer. Searchlight Pictures will distribute the movie.\n\nMonica Barbaro, Elle Fanning, and Edward Norton will also star in A Complete Unknown. Frequent Mangold collaborator Boyd Holbrook will also appear as Johnny Cash. P. J. Byrne, and Scoot McNairy.\n\nThis is not James Mangold's first biopic. He previously directed the biographical drama Girl, Interrupted. Additionally, Mangold directed a Johnny Cash biopic titled Walk the Line in 2005.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix stars as Cash in Walk the Line. He earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Reese Witherspoon was nominated for Best Actress and won the award.\n\nMangold is also known for his movies 3:10 to Yuma, Logan, and Ford v Ferrari. His most recent project is Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_korpan@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Andrew Korpan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Rain's_a-Gonna_Fall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Seeger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Guthrie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Woody Guthrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Barbaro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monica Barbaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Like a Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elle Fanning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_triangle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Love triangle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoken_word", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spoken word"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward Norton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joan Baez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Dial_of_Destiny", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searchlight_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Searchlight Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._J._Byrne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P.

a young, 19-year-old Bob Dylan coming to New York with two dollars in his pocket and becoming a worldwide sensation within three years.\"\n\nHe continued: \"First being embraced into a family of folk music in New York and of course kind of outrunning him at a certain point as his star rises so beyond belief.\n\n\"It's such an interesting true story and about such an interesting moment in the American scene.\"", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_aubrey@nme.com", "name": "Elizabeth Aubrey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cultural icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Barbaro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monica Barbaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyd_Holbrook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boyd Holbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoot_McNairy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scoot McNairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Fogler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dan Fogler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elle Fanning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newport Folk Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward Norton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rock and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonka_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wonka (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collider_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collider (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Rain's_a-Gonna_Fall", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Musical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Culture of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Elle-Fanning-and-Timothee-Chalamet-on-the-set-of-A-Complete-Unknown-CREDIT_-Getty-Images.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759626", "eventUri": "eng-9759626", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 57, "textEnd": 64}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

His knack for penning lyrics infused with political and social influences led to several of his songs becoming anthems for the Civil Rights movement. At the same time, his historic decision to go \"electric\" helped usher in a new age of rock music. Given his legacy, numerous films have tackled his story. Now, Chalamet is stepping into the role of Dylan in A Complete Unknown.\n\nThe biopic has been years in the making as filmmaker James Mangold first announced the project in early 2020. While the movie faced delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the project remained in development with Chalamet attached as the lead star. So far, the Wonka and Dune star has shown a dedication to the role somewhat similar to that Austin Butler displayed in his transformation into Elvis Presley. Like Butler, Chalamet will do all his own singing for the film and even worked with the same vocal team Butler worked with for Elvis. Even though there was a period during COVID-19 when the film's status was uncertain, Chalamet continued preparing for the role, researching Dylan and visiting important sites in Dylan's career, such as Greenwich Village.\n\nA Complete Unknown does not yet have a confirmed release date, but it is expected to arrive sometime in December 2024 in the United States. In the first official trailer for the movie, Searchlight Pictures promised the movie was \"coming soon.\"\n\nThe trailer introduces Chalamet's Dylan as a young artist who may embody the future of music. Viewers soon hear Chalamet singing as Dylan for the first time as he delivers a stirring cover of \"A Hard Rain's A-Coming.\" There are also hints of a budding romance between him and Elle Fanning's character and the toll his whirlwind rise to fame takes on him.\n\nFanning, who has acted with Chalamet before in A Rainy Day in New York, stars opposite him again in A Complete Unknown as Sylvie Russo. Russo appears to be inspired by Suze Rotolo, an artist who dated Dylan in the 1960s and appeared on the cover of his album The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. Top Gun: Maverick's Monica Barbaro portrays another of Dylan's love interests, Joan Baez. Baez was one of the first artists to collaborate with Dylan when he was still unknown, and their partnership developed into a relationship, but he abruptly ended it in 1965. Edward Norton stars in A Complete Unknown as Pete Seeger, one of Dylan's earliest supporters.\n\nA Complete Unknown will also feature several other iconic artists, including Boyd Holbrook as Johnny Cash, Scoot McNairy as Woody Guthrie, Will Harrison as Bob Neuwirth, and Charlie Tahan as Al Kooper. Rounding out the cast are Dan Fogler as Albert Grossman, P. J. Byrne as Harold Leventhal, Norbert Leo Butz as Alan Lomax, and Kayli Carter as Maria Muldaur.\n\nThe official synopsis for A Complete Unknown reads:\n\nSet in the influential New York music scene of the early 60s, A COMPLETE UNKNOWN follows 19-year-old Minnesota musician BOB DYLAN's (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) meteoric rise as a folk singer to concert halls and the top of the charts - his songs and mystique becoming a worldwide sensation - culminating in his groundbreaking electric rock and roll performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965.\n\nA Complete Unknown will be hard-pressed to differentiate itself from the numerous other Dylan biopics. However, its decision to focus on a specific moment in his life, the electric set controversy, and Chalamet's mesmerizing transformation into the songwriter bode well for its performance. If director Mangold can make his Dylan biopic as strong as his Johnny Cash biopic, Walk the Line, it should fare quite well.", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mary Sue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_ulatowski@themarysue.com", "name": "Rachel Ulatowski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Austin Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elvis Presley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_civil_rights_movement_(1954\u20131968)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African-American civil rights movement (1954\u20131968)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searchlight_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Searchlight Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suze_Rotolo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suze Rotolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elle Fanning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joan Baez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Village", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenwich Village"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greenwich Village"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Barbaro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monica Barbaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Leventhal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harold Leventhal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._J._Byrne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P.

I hope it'll be recognized for the Oscars. This movie right here from what we have seen is amazing. I am so here for this!\"\n\nYet, others were critical of Chalamet's acting skills. One user said: \"I am never going to see this as anything but Timothee Chalamet doing Bob Dylan cosplay.\"\n\nSome were nonplussed by his singing as Dyland, while others branded it as \"perfect\" as \"spot on\".\n\nThey wrote further down the thread: \"Sometimes I will watch an actor playing a famous person and think that they transcended the part, actually became that person for the film, like Elvis. All I see here is Timothee Chalamet acting, if that makes sense.\"\n\nOthers are hopeful that Mangold's experience of making biopics will help out this film. One user said: \"James Mangold's no stranger to music biopics so this should be great.\"\n\nThe Bob Dylan biopic only started filming in the spring of this year, and production was wrapped up in early July.\n\nLast year the actor said he has heard a wealth of unreleased Bob Dylan music in preparation to play the iconic artist. As part of training to sing as Bob Dylan in the biopic, Chalamet worked with the team that assisted Austin Butler for Elvis.\n\nIn a recent interview with NME alongside his Dune: Part Two co-star Butler, Chalamet said he would have liked Butler's version of Elvis Presley, to appear in A Complete Unknown.\n\n\"I wish you were in it,\" Chalamet said to Butler during the interview. \"I was wishing to create a sort of musical cinematic universe.\"", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aneesa_ahmed@nme.com", "name": "Aneesa Ahmed", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elle Fanning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Seeger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Albums_Chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UK Albums Chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edward Norton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joan Baez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newport Folk Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Cash", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Cash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rock and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elvis Presley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NME", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NME"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_timotheechalamet_edwardnorton_getty_2000x1270.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759626", "eventUri": "eng-9759626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

The film, set in the early days of Dylan's career, explores the vibrant 1960s New York folk scene. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet stars as Bob Dylan, with Edward Norton playing Pete Seeger, who serves as a framing device in the trailer. The trailer features Dylan performing \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\" from his 1963 album \"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan.\"\n\nThe movie hints at a love triangle involving Dylan, his onetime girlfriend Suze Rotolo, and folk legend Joan Baez, portrayed by Monica Barbaro. While Rotolo is not directly depicted, Elle Fanning plays Sylvie Russo, a fictional character representing Rotolo. This creative choice acknowledges Rotolo's influence without directly portraying her, given her discomfort with being defined by her relationship with Dylan.\n\nThe film covers a pivotal period in Dylan's life, detailing his rise to fame as a folk singer and his controversial shift to rock music at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. This era includes Dylan's tumultuous relationship with Rotolo, who inspired many of his early songs. Despite their breakup, Rotolo's influence on Dylan's music and public persona remains significant.\n\nIn \"A Complete Unknown,\" audiences will see Dylan's transformation from a 19-year-old Minnesota musician to a global icon. The film captures his journey from performing in small venues to becoming a sensation in concert halls and on the charts, culminating in his groundbreaking electric performance at Newport.\n\nThe cast includes Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Bob Dylan, Edward Norton, Elle Fanning, Monica Barbaro, Boyd Holbrook, Dan Fogler, Norbert Leo Butz, and Scoot McNairy. \"A Complete Unknown\" will be released in theaters this December.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suze_Rotolo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suze Rotolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searchlight_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Searchlight Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Seeger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Barbaro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monica Barbaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Rain's_a-Gonna_Fall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elle Fanning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward Norton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joan Baez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Folklore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyd_Holbrook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boyd Holbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoot_McNairy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scoot McNairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Fogler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Fogler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newport Folk Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Leo_Butz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norbert Leo Butz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport,_Rhode_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newport, Rhode Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newport, Rhode Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/bob-dylan1721832246-0/bob-dylan1721832246-0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759626", "eventUri": "eng-9759626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

That's the story director James Mangold will tell with A Complete Unknown, which will show how one of the most iconic and influential musicians ever began his climb to the top. The first trailer for A Complete Unknown introduces Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as a young Bob Dylan on the precipice of true stardom.\n\nThis trailer makes clear something we already knew about A Complete Unknown. No matter how good this film may or may not be, it's going to have a pretty amazing soundtrack. But there's a lot more to this movie than just its incredible music and wig budget. It's a story about someone going from anonymity to the upper stratosphere of fame and everything that comes with it. Here's the film's official synopsis from Searchlight Pictures:\n\nSet in the influential New York music scene of the early 60s, A Complete Unknown follows 19-year-old Minnesota musician Bob Dylan's meteoric rise as a folk singer to concert halls and the top of the charts - his songs and mystique becoming a worldwide sensation - culminating in his groundbreaking electric rock and roll performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965.\n\nBob Dylan isn't the only famous figure a big Hollywood star will play in the film. A Complete Unknown also features Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo (who Dylan dated during this era), Edward Norton as Pete Seeger, Monica Barbaro as Joan Baez, Boyd Holbrook as Johnny Cash, Scoot McNairy as Woody Guthrie, Norbert Leo Butz as Alan Lomax, and Dan Fogler as manager Albert Grossman.\n\nTwo-time Oscar nominee Jay Cocks (The Age of Innocence, Gangs of New York) co-wrote the script with Mangold. However, there's one thing we don't know about this story of a legendary career's start just yet. Searchlight Pictures says it will arrive in theaters \"soon.\"", "source": {"uri": "nerdist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nerdist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundtrack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soundtrack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searchlight_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Searchlight Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Innocence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Age of Innocence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Grossman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Albert Grossman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyd_Holbrook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boyd Holbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoot_McNairy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scoot McNairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Fogler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Fogler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cocks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jay Cocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Lomax", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alan Lomax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elle Fanning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newport Folk Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Seeger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Guthrie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Woody Guthrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Leo_Butz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norbert Leo Butz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Cash", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Cash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edward Norton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joan Baez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rock and roll"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://legendary-digital-network-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/24065851/A-Complete-Unknown.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759626", "eventUri": "eng-9759626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Does Chalamet sing in the film, and is that the actor's real voice in the teaser trailer?\n\nFrom Searchlight Pictures, A Complete Unknown is directed and written by James Mangold (Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny), who penned the screenplay with Jay Cocks based on the 2015 book \"Dylan Goes Electric!\" by Elijah Wald.\n\nThe film is set in New York in the early 1960s and follows \"19-year-old Minnesota musician Bob Dylan's meteoric rise as a folk singer to concert halls and the top of the charts -- his songs and mystique becoming a worldwide sensation -- culminating in his groundbreaking electric rock and roll performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965,\" according to the official description.\n\nThe star-studded cast also features Monica Barbaro as Dylan's collaborator and former lover Joan Baez, Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo -- another artist who dated Dylan in the early '60s -- as well as Edward Norton as Pete Seeger, Boyd Holbrook as Johnny Cash, and Scoot McNairy as Woody Guthrie.\n\nIn the first official teaser, released on July 24, the Wonka star sings a part of Dylan's \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\" from his 1963 album The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. But is that the 28-year-old actor's real voice?\n\nYes, that's Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's voice in A Complete Unknown's teaser. He will lend his real vocals for the anticipated Bob Dylan biopic, which will be released in theaters in December.\n\nWhen asked by Collider in April 2023 whether Chalamet was singing for the movie rather than having Dylan's voice dubbed over, director James Mangold answered, \"Of course!\" Chalamet also took singing and guitar lessons to play the role, IndieWire reported.\n\nThis isn't the first time Chalamet has showcased his singing talents in a film. He sang in the 2023 movie musical Wonka, which featured seven musical numbers. He contributed to the original motion picture soundtrack with songs like \"You Never Had Chocolate Like This,\" \"A World of Your Own,\" \"Sorry, Noodle,\" and \"Pure Imagination.\"\n\nThe actor, who attended Manhattan's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, also sang in 2019's A Rainy Day in New York. A video even surfaced of the rising star performing \"Sweet Charity\" in a play at LaGuardia.

A Complete Unknown is set to arrive in cinemas in the United Kingdom in January, 2025, but will be released in the United States a month earlier.\n\nIn addition to starring Chalamet as a young Dylan, Edward Norton portrays Pete Seeger, and Elle Fanning plays Dylan's love interest Sylvie Russo, based on Suze Rotolo. The cast also features Boyd Holbrook Dan Fogler, Norbert Leo Buzt and Scoot McNairy.\n\nThe movie follows Dylan as he makes his way in New York after moving from Minnesota as a 19-year-old in 1961 with aspirations of becoming a professional singer-songwriter. A Complete Unknown charts his sharp rise from obscurity to musical messiah, inspiring a generation with his heartfelt protest songs before culminating with his controversial performance at Newport Folk Festival in 1965 that saw him go electric.\n\nDuring an appearance on the Happy Sad Confused podcast in 2023, director Mangold discussed the new project and revealed that he'd spent significant time with Dylan, who had given his blessing for the project. Additionally, Mangold claimed Dylan had \"personally annotated\" the script.\n\nHowever, Mangold also ensured Dylan fans that A Complete Unknown isn't a typical biopic, stating, \"It's a kind of ensemble piece about this moment in time, the early '60s in New York, and this 17-year-old kid with $16 in his pockets hitchhikes his way to New York to meet Woody Guthrie who is in the hospital and is dying of a nerve disease.\n\nAs the trailer shows, Dylan befriends Pete Seeger, played by Edward Norton, and Mangold previously revealed that the film focuses on their relationship. \"Pete sets him up with gigs at local clubs, and there you meet Joan Baez and all these other people who are part of this world, and this wanderer who comes in from Minnesota with a fresh name and a fresh outlook on life, becomes a star, signs to the biggest record company in the world within a year, and three years later, has record sales rivalling the Beatles,\" the director said.\n\nLast year, during an interview with GQ, Chalamet explained how he fully absorbed himself in the world of Dylan in preparation for the film, and even recruited the vocal coach that Austin Butler used for Elvis ahead of shooting A Complete Unknown.\n\nIn the trailer, Chalamet is heard singing as Dylan, which shows his dedication to the role was worth the hours of practice. The New Yorker previously said of how he managed to get into the mind of the legendary singer-songwriter, \"You need your ability to imagine, your ability to observe, and your ability to experience. And if any one of those is compromised, your ability to create is compromised in some way.\"", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_taysom@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Joe Taysom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pete Seeger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyd_Holbrook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boyd Holbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoot_McNairy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scoot McNairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suze_Rotolo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suze Rotolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Fogler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Fogler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elle Fanning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edward Norton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest_song", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protest song"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newport Folk Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Guthrie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Woody Guthrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joan Baez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elvis Presley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Beatles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GQ"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/static/uploads/1/2024/07/A-COMPLETE-UNKNOWN-2024-Bob-Dylan-Biopic-Timothe\u0301e-Chalamet-Searchlight-Pictures-2024-Far-Out-Magazine.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759626", "eventUri": "eng-9759626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The trailer culminates with Dylan's groundbreaking performance at 1965's Newport Folk Festival, where the folk singer notably switched from acoustic to electric rock and roll.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nA Complete Unknown's cast includes Edward Norton as Pete Seeger, Monica Barbaro as Joan Baez, Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo, Boyd Holbrook as Johnny Cash, Dan Fogler as Albert Grossman, Norbert Leo Butz as Alan Lomax, and Scoot McNairy as Woody Guthrie.\n\nMangold directs A Complete Unknown from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jay Cocks. The film is based on Elijah Wald's 2015 book Dylan Goes Electric! Newport, Seeger, Dylan, and the Night that Split the Sixties. Mangold has experience directing musical biopics, including 2005's Walk the Line, starring Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. Walk the Line received five Oscar nominations, with Witherspoon winning for Best Actress.\n\nProducers include Chalamet, Mangold, Michael Bederman, Fred Berger, Bob Bookman, Alan Gasmer, Alex Heineman, Peter Jaysen, Brian Kavanaugh-Jones, Andrew Rona, and Jeff Rosen.\n\nChalamet continues his ascent into superstardom with A Complete Unknown, which could result in his second Oscar nomination. In March, Chalamet starred as Paul Atreides in Dune: Part Two, the epic sequel to Denis Villeneuve's Dune. Dune: Part Two should be one of the contenders for Best Picture at the 2025 Oscars.\n\nA Complete Unknown will be released in theaters this December.", "source": {"uri": "digitaltrends.com",

Great rendition of A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall though.'\n\nHowever, others were well on board with the actor's performance, with fan Lainey enthusing: 'I like that u can hear the Dylan influence in the voice, but it's not too close that it can be considered a total parody.'\n\n'He sounds just like him!' claimed @StaffPickFilms, while @lestatdeswift sniped: 'Timmy fangirls in the quotes not understanding this sounds exactly like Bob Dylan.'\n\n'I'm afraid that he ate with this kids, he sounds like Dylan,' insisted @itskendallrae among a chorus of calls for Chalamet to receive his second Oscar nomination for the role.\n\nFight Club actor Edward Norton appears as American folk singer Pete Seegerat the top of the trailer too, introducing a young Dylan to a small crowd in a venue.\n\n'I want to tell you a little story,' he tells the audience. 'A few months back my friend Woody Guthrie and I, we met a young man, he dropped in us out of nowhere, and he played us a song, in that moment we got a feeling we were getting a glimpse of the future.'\n\nChalamet is then shown performing, which is interspersed with clips of him with The Great actress Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo, a character based on Suze Rotolo, an artist who was part of the Greenwich Village scene along with Dylan and was his girlfriend in the early 1960s.\n\nThe Dune: Part Two actor is also glimpsed kissing Top Gun: Maverick actress Monica Barbaro as folk singer and counterculture figure Joan Baez, with whom he would sing duets such as With God On Our Side.\n\nFilmmaker Mangold also directed the critically acclaimed Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line starring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, which was nominated for five Oscars, winning one for best actress for Witherspoon.\n\nA Complete Unknown will follow the now reclusive musician Dylan from a 19-year-old and his 'meteoric rise as a folk singer to concert halls and the top of the charts' up to the singer's electric rock and roll performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965.\n\nDuring the early 1960s, Dylan was at the forefront of folk music being revived in the US through the albums Bob Dylan, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan and The Times They Are A-Changin' which relied on acoustic guitar music.\n\nIn 1965's Bringing It All Back Home, he shifted to working with electronic instruments and his set at the Newport Folk Festival was criticised for being very loud, including from Seeger, who he had been close to.\n\nBorn Robert Zimmerman in Duluth, Minnesota, he was the first songwriter to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016, with the Swedish academy crediting him with 'having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition'.\n\nHis songs have been recorded more than 6,000 times, with artists as varied as The Byrds, Jimi Hendrix and Adele finding both commercial and critical success with covers.\n\nDylan has to date sold more than 125 million records globally and won a best original song Oscar in 2001 for Things Have Changed, which he wrote for the film Wonder Boys.\n\nA Complete Unknown is scheduled to release in cinemas in December.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk

That really is Chalamet singing the track, too -- the actor took vocal lessons in order to provide his own spin on the Bard's legendary material.\n\n\"A few months back, my friend Woody Guthrie and I, we met a young man,\" Edward Norton, who plays as folk singer Pete Seeger, says ahead of the performance. \"He dropped in on us out of nowhere and he played us a song.

Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free newsletter to get the latest trailers, celebrity interviews, film reviews, and more.\n\nChalamet can also be seen traveling past several major New York City landmarks from Dylan's life like Cafe Wha? -- where he performed his first gig -- and the Chelsea Hotel. As his fame grows, he finds himself caught up not only in a storm of popularity, but a love triangle between his first love Sylvie Russo (Elle Fanning) and fellow folk singer Joan Baez (Monica Barbaro).\n\nThe trailer comes after Chalamet was spotted filming at multiple locations in NYC back in March. The film, which was written by Mangold and Jay Cocks, is set in the early 1960s and follows 19-year-old musician Bob Dylan's meteoric rise to fame up until his unforgettable rock performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965.\n\nMangold told Collider last year that he considered the time period to be \"such an amazing time in American culture\" and Dylan's life. He added, \"A young 19-year-old Bob Dylan coming to New York with two dollars in his pocket and becoming a worldwide sensation within three years. First being embraced into a family of folk music in New York and of course kind of outrunning him at.\"\n\nThe film also stars Boyd Holbrook as Johnny Cash, Scoot McNairy as Woody Guthrie, Charlie Tahan as Al Kooper, and Dan Fogler as Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman.\n\nA Complete Unknown knock, knock, knocks on movie theater doors this December.

Guthrie died in 1967.\n\nThe beginning of the trailer also features a shot of Moran's, a pub on Garden Street in Hoboken given a '60s makeover to become McAnn's bar, a New York watering hole where Chalamet filmed in April.\n\nThe clip also shows Chalamet in Jersey City (as Greenwich Village) and his Dylan heading into a car and away from a crush of fans in a scene filmed in Paterson.\n\nThe main cast is rounded out by Boyd Holbrook (Mangold's \"Logan\"), Dan Fogler (the \"Fantastic Beasts\" movies), Tony winner Norbert Leo Butz (\"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,\" \"The Exorcist: Believer\") and Scoot McNairy (\"!2 Years a Slave\").\n\nSee Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet filming Bob Dylan movie in Hoboken as Chalamaniacs buzz around set\n\nSee Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet filming in N.J. with Edward

The actor sings Dylan's 1963 anti-war song \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,\" dividing the internet, much like his casting announcement did.\n\n\"Stranger Things\" star and Dylan superfan Jamie Campbell Bower posted on X to share his support for Chalamet.\n\n\"As a man who has Bob Dylan tattooed on his butt cheeks I can safely say I am VERY excited about Chalamet as Dylan after seeing that trailer,\" Bower wrote.\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, director and co-writer Mangold lauded Chalamet's acting and ability to embody Dylan.\n\n\"There were also moments where it felt like something was getting channeled,\" he said. \"I don't mean in mimicry. I mean in feeling.\"\n\nChalamet fan account Club Chalamet shared its support for the star on X.\n\n\"Oscar pundits, start adding Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet to your predictions! Wow!\" the fan page wrote.\n\nSome users were not entirely convinced by the \"Dune\" star's singing.\n\n\"I'm sorry but that is just not bob dylan. that is timothee chalamet,\" one user wrote.\n\nAnother user echoed the same sentiment.\n\n\"The singing is fine but then he starts speaking and I'm like that's literally just timothee,\" the account wrote. \"Not moving.\"\n\nChalamet says only a few words in the trailer. \"That's all I got so far,\" he utters after playing \"A Hard Rain\" for his family.\n\nIn his interview with Rolling Stone, Mangold made it clear that Chalamet didn't strive to mimic Dylan.\n\n\"There's sometimes a perception out there that what we're doing is about a perfect replication of a human voice and physicality. We can't do that. Not with human bodies,\" he said. \"What you have to be trying to do is to do what movies do well, which is to unpack the emotional dynamic of these people. And even then, it's just my version of it.\"\n\nMangold is no stranger to music biopics. 2005's \"Walk the Line\" saw Joaquin Phoenix take on the role of country singer Johnny Cash, ultimately earning him an Academy Award nomination. Phoenix also did his own singing for the movie.\n\nMangold says the teaser is just a start. Viewers will need to see the full movie to appreciate Chalamet's performance.\n\n\"It's going to be impossible for people in trailers or teasers or photos to see, but the way he grows this character is a real act of acting brilliance in my opinion,\" Mangold said.\n\n\"I like this,\" one X user said about the trailer. \"It reminds me of how Joaquin Phoenix didn't sound exactly like @JohnnyCash but sounded good.\"\n\n\"Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet sings Bob Dylan without imitating Bob Dylan but being someone who shows his vulnerability and is masterfully able to convey emotions,\" another user posted. \"I'm on my knees.\"\n\n\"A Complete Unknown\" isn't Chalamet's first foray into musicals. Last year, Chalamet played the titular Willy Wonka in the origin story \"Wonka\" -- set before the events of \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\"\n\n\"A Complete Unknown,\" which arrives in theaters in December, follows the career of the folk icon, opening on the singer's 1961 arrival in New York City from Minnesota. Monica Barbaro plays Joan Baez, Elle Fanning depicts Sylvie Russo and Edward Norton is Pete Seeger in the movie. Boyd Holbrook, P. J.

A few months back my friend Woody Guthrie and I, we met a young man, he dropped in us out of nowhere, and he played us a song, in that moment we got a feeling we were getting a glimpse of the future.\"\n\nChalamet then performs A Hard Rain's A\u2010Gonna Fall, playing a guitar with his face still in shadow until his profile is revealed and he is seen wearing a tan jacket and shirt.\n\nThis is interspersed with clips of him at a church venue, where he looks at The Great actress Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo, a character based on Suze Rotolo, an artist who was part of the Greenwich Village scene along with Dylan and was his girlfriend in the early 1960s.\n\nFanning gives him a peck on the cheek, before Chalamet is also seen kissing Top Gun: Maverick actress Monica Barbaro as folk singer and counterculture figure Joan Baez, with whom he would sing duets such as With God On Our Side.\n\nThe movie is directed by James Mangold, who also directed the critically acclaimed Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line starring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, which was nominated for five Oscars, winning one for best actress for Witherspoon.\n\nIts description reads: \"Set in the influential New York music scene of the early 60s, A Complete Unknown follows 19-year-old Minnesota musician Bob Dylan's (Timothee Chalamet) meteoric rise as a folk singer to concert halls and the top of the charts - his songs and mystique becoming a worldwide sensation - culminating in his groundbreaking electric rock and roll performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965.\"\n\nDuring the early 1960s, Dylan was at the forefront of folk music being revived in the US through the albums Bob Dylan, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan and The Times They Are A-Changin' which relied on acoustic guitar music.\n\nIn 1965's Bringing It All Back Home, he shifted to working with electronic instruments and his set at the Newport Folk Festival was criticised for being very loud, including from Seeger, who he had been close to.\n\nBorn Robert Zimmerman in Duluth, Minnesota, he was the first songwriter to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016, with the Swedish academy crediting him with \"having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\".\n\nHis songs have been recorded more than 6,000 times, with artists as varied as The Byrds, Jimi Hendrix and Adele finding both commercial and critical success with covers.\n\nDylan has to date sold more than 125 million records globally and won a best original song Oscar in 2001 for Things Have Changed, which he wrote for the film Wonder Boys.\n\nHe has been previously depicted in 2007's I'm Not There, which saw various actors portray Dylan including Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Richard Gere and the late Heath Ledger.\n\nA Netflix documentary, Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story By Martin Scorsese, saw him do an on-camera interview, thought to be his first in a decade for the film.\n\nThere is no release date yet for the new film.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlotte_mclaughlin@aol.co.uk", "name": "Charlotte McLaughlin",

Chalamet drew inspiration from Dune: Part Two co-star Austin Butler's dedication to his musical biopic role as Elvis Presley. Chalamet has previously showcased his singing talents in Wonka, proving he has a versatile vocal range.\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet is playing legendary folk artist Bob Dylan in the upcoming biopic A Complete Unknown - but does the actor really sing and play guitar in the new movie? A Complete Unknown is being directed by James Mangold, marking his second biopic of an iconic musician after his acclaimed Johnny Cash movie Walk the Line. Mangold has co-written the screenplay with Jay Cocks, who previously worked on the Martin Scorsese films Silence, Gangs of New York, and The Age of Innocence, based on the 2015 book Dylan Goes Electric! by Elijah Wald.\n\nSearchlight Pictures has just dropped the first trailer for A Complete Unknown, which debuts Chalamet's portrayal of Dylan. The trailer also features Monica Barbaro as Joan Baez, Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo, and Edward Norton as Pete Seeger (who were all previously seen in leaked set photos), as well as a couple of Dylan songs on the soundtrack. The trailer features a live performance of the classic Dylan track \"A Hard Rain's A\u2010Gonna Fall,\" but is it really Chalamet singing or was the singing voice dubbed in?\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet Sings & Plays Guitar In The Bob Dylan Biopic, A Complete Unknown Chalamet trained with Austin Butler's Elvis team\n\nYes, Chalamet is really singing and playing guitar in A Complete Unknown. In an interview with GQ, Chalamet revealed that he'd been working with the same team who trained his Dune: Part Two co-star Austin Butler to play Elvis Presley in Baz Luhrmann's sensationalized biopic Elvis. Chalamet has worked with a dialect coach named Tim Monich to get the accent right, a vocal coach named Eric Vetro to get the singing voice right, and a movement coach named Polly Bennett to get the body language right.\n\nChalamet was inspired by Butler's commitment to the role of Elvis and wanted to emulate that commitment with his turn as Dylan. Hopefully, after all is said and done, Chalamet will be able to go back to his regular speaking voice and won't still sound like Dylan when he does interviews and attends awards shows. While his impression of Dylan's singing voice is spot-on, it is possible to tell that it's Chalamet with the distinctive deep cadence of his voice.\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet Already Proved He Could Sing In Wonka This isn't Chalamet's first musical role\n\nA Complete Unknown isn't the first movie to feature Chalamet's musical talents; he did plenty of singing in last year's hit fantasy comedy Wonka. From \"A Hatful of Dreams\" to \"For a Moment\" to various reprisals of \"You've Never Had Chocolate Like This,\" Chalamet sang a bunch of songs in Wonka - and proved he has an impressive singing voice. Unlike Wonka, A Complete Unknown requires Chalamet to emulate a very specific singing voice (and based on the trailer, it seems like he's nailed it).\n\nSource: GQ\n\nA Complete Unknown\n\nA Complete

A few months back my friend Woody Guthrie and I, we met a young man, he dropped in us out of nowhere, and he played us a song, in that moment we got a feeling we were getting a glimpse of the future.\"\n\nChalamet then performs A Hard Rain's A\u2010Gonna Fall, playing a guitar with his face still in shadow until his profile is revealed and he is seen wearing a tan jacket and shirt.\n\nThis is interspersed with clips of him at a church venue, where he looks at The Great actress Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo, a character based on Suze Rotolo, an artist who was part of the Greenwich Village scene along with Dylan and was his girlfriend in the early 1960s.\n\nFanning gives him a peck on the cheek, before Chalamet is also seen kissing Top Gun: Maverick actress Monica Barbaro as folk singer and counterculture figure Joan Baez, with whom he would sing duets such as With God On Our Side.\n\nThe movie is directed by James Mangold, who also directed the critically acclaimed Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line starring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, which was nominated for five Oscars, winning one for best actress for Witherspoon.\n\nIts description reads: \"Set in the influential New York music scene of the early 60s, A Complete Unknown follows 19-year-old Minnesota musician Bob Dylan's (Timothee Chalamet) meteoric rise as a folk singer to concert halls and the top of the charts - his songs and mystique becoming a worldwide sensation - culminating in his groundbreaking electric rock and roll performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965.\"\n\nDuring the early 1960s, Dylan was at the forefront of folk music being revived in the US through the albums Bob Dylan, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan and The Times They Are A-Changin' which relied on acoustic guitar music.\n\nIn 1965's Bringing It All Back Home, he shifted to working with electronic instruments and his set at the Newport Folk Festival was criticised for being very loud, including from Seeger, who he had been close to.\n\nBorn Robert Zimmerman in Duluth, Minnesota, he was the first songwriter to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016, with the Swedish academy crediting him with \"having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\".\n\nHis songs have been recorded more than 6,000 times, with artists as varied as The Byrds, Jimi Hendrix and Adele finding both commercial and critical success with covers.\n\nDylan has to date sold more than 125 million records globally and won a best original song Oscar in 2001 for Things Have Changed, which he wrote for the film Wonder Boys.\n\nHe has been previously depicted in 2007's I'm Not There, which saw various actors portray Dylan including Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Richard Gere and the late Heath Ledger.\n\nA Netflix documentary, Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story By Martin Scorsese, saw him do an on-camera interview, thought to be his first in a decade for the film.", "source": {"uri":

(Getty)\n\nThe first trailer for the upcoming film A Complete Unknown is finally here, and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet looks unrecognisable as he underwent a Bob Dylan-style transformation for the role.\n\nThe film sees the Wonka actor in the starring role and even provides his vocals to truly channel the legendary singer-songwriter. It comes after the star lent his voice to his Willy Wonka role and sounded like a young Bing Crosby, according to the Wonka director.\n\nSearchlight Pictures shared the official teaser trailer on Wednesday (July 24), showing the actor embodying the singer with Dylan's iconic suede jacket, sunglasses, and voluminous curls.\n\nIn the trailer, a Chalamet-recorded version of the 1960s track \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\" plays. After watching the trailer, fans couldn't believe how much Chalamet looks like Dylan.\n\n\"He looks exactly like bob dylan wow,\" wrote one social media user on X, while another added: \"It's like watching a young Dylan come back to life.\"\n\nA third echoed: \"Crazy this shot doesn't even look like Chalamet!\" Another onlooker commented: \"Jaw dropped. Wow.\"\n\nThe trailer also showed fans a glimpse of Monica Barbaro as singer-songwriter Joan Baez, Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russio, Edward Norton as singer Pete Seeger, and Boyd Holbrook as Johnny Cash.\n\nThe film's official synopsis reads: \"Set in the influential New York music scene of the early '60s, A Complete Unknown follows 19-year-old Minnesota musician Bob Dylan's meteoric rise as a folk singer to concert halls and the top of the charts - his songs and mystique becoming a worldwide sensation - culminating in his groundbreaking electric rock 'n' roll performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965.\"\n\nDirector James Mangold said that Chalamet's version of Dylan is achieved \"in a very poetic way\". He told Rolling Stone that the actor has a particular knack for \"growing the character up\" from his teenager-with-a-dream origins to the superstar that fans know and love.\n\nMangold said: \"One of the things I think that will be startling is, most Dylan fans don't focus on the boy in the newsboy cap who's arriving in town. And Timmy really carries this character from a 19-year-old boy telling tales of working on the carnival into this person that we recognize as an icon. Timmy finds the path to carry us there.\n\n\"It's going to be impossible for people in trailers or teasers or photos to see, but the way he grows this character is a real act of acting brilliance in my opinion.\"", "source": {"uri": "thepinknews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PinkNews | Latest lesbian, gay, bi and trans news | LGBTQ+ news"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gabriella_ferlita@thepinknews.com", "name": "Gabriella Ferlita", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonka_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wonka (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searchlight_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Searchlight Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_Crosby", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bing Crosby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Wonka", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Willy Wonka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Barbaro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monica Barbaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Rain's_a-Gonna_Fall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyd_Holbrook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boyd Holbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elle Fanning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_cut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob cut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Seeger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Cash", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Cash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward Norton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joan Baez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newport Folk Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cultural icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rock and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice_Actors", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice Actors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.thepinknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/tcnntep22gq.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759626", "eventUri": "eng-9759626", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 598, "textEnd": 605}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Actor Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is showcased as Dylan and sings Bob's \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\" within the two-minute clip.\n\nDirected by James Mangold, A Complete Unknown traces Dylan's career from his move to New York City in 1961 through his infamous electric appearance at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Chalamet is joined in the cast by Monica Barbaro as Joan Baez, Edward Norton as Pete Seeger and Elle Fanning as his girlfriend, Sylvie Russo. Mangold told Rolling Stone that Sylvie Russo is a pseudonym for Dylan's real girlfriend during the period, Suze Rotolo.\n\nAs reported, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet does his own singing in the film. James Mangold wrote the screenplay with Jay Cocks based on the 2015 tome Dylan Goes Electric! Others set to appear in A Complete Unknown include Boyd Holbrook as Johnny Casg, Scoot McNairy as Woody Guthrie, P.J. Byrne as Harold Leventhal and Will Harrison as Bob Neuwirth.\n\nJames Mangold had high praise for Chalamet's vocal chops, stating to Rolling Stone that Timothy made the portral work:\n\nI think what's so wonderful about what Timmy is doing is that, while not answering questions about Bob, at the same time I think he does in a very poetic way, which is to suggest really empathically through his performance how one might want to make music, but one might not want to have people in your face all the time. And I think in a way, Bob answers that... Timmy, who I'm used to calling Bob sometimes, answers that question. I think he walks a really beautiful line of allowing an audience to see what a joy it is for this character to make music and what pure joy he experiences in his camaraderie with other musicians and his exploration of ideas and words and music, both making it and listening to others. Where Timmy also does something really quite profound is to show you his almost genetically predisposed discomfort with what his own great achievements then bring upon him and that, in terms of people wanting things, transactional relationships, or relationships that are tainted by the immense power and talent.\n\nA Complete Unknown hits theaters in December via Searchlight Pictures.

Though fans have gotten a few sneak peeks of the film, they haven't seen Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet in action as The Bard-until now.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nThe first trailer for A Complete Unknown sees Chalamet sporting Dylan's '60s look. With a turned up collar and a smoke cloud around him, Chalamet embodies the icon's instantly recognizable silhouette. But, Chalamet doesn't just look like Dylan, he sounds like him too.\n\nWhen Dylan fans first got word that Chalamet was doing his own singing for the project, there was no doubt some trepidation. Nevertheless, the trailer reveals the actor's vocals to be pretty spot on. He sings a few verses of \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\" over the top of selected scenes from the movie.\n\nElsewhere in the trailer, we see Dylan fall in love with Sylvie Russo (a fictional character based on an early love interest of Dylan's) and meet a young Joan Baez. Though short and relatively vague, everything about the trailer bodes well for the impending film.\n\nCheck it out, below.\n\nWhat We Know About A Complete Unknown\n\nDirector Mangold has revealed tidbits about the film, here and there. He described it as an all-encompassing look at Dylan's early days and rise to recognition.\n\n\"It's such an amazing time in American culture,\" Mangold recently said. \"[It's] the story of a young, 19-year-old Bob Dylan coming to New York with like two dollars in his pocket and becoming a worldwide sensation within three years, first being embraced ... into the family of folk music in New York and then, of course, kind of outrunning them at a certain point as his star rises so beyond belief.\"\n\nAside from the basic plot, we know which characters from Dylan's life will make an appearance. The cast includes Monica Barbaro (Baez), Elle Fanning (Russo), Edward Norton (Pete Seeger), Boyd Holbrook (Johnny Cash), and Nick Offerman (folk archivist Alan Lomax).\n\nNo firm release date is set for A Complete Unknown, but it is expected to arrive in early 2025.\n\n(Photo by Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images; Photo by Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images)", "source": {"uri": "americansongwriter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Songwriter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_hopper@americansongwriter.com", "name": "Alex Hopper", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Rain's_a-Gonna_Fall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joan Baez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyd_Holbrook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boyd Holbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Lomax", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alan Lomax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Offerman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Offerman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elle Fanning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Seeger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Cash", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Cash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edward Norton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://americansongwriter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Getty_BobDylanTimotheeChalamet2000_041824.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759626", "eventUri": "eng-9759626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Ferrari (2019).\n\nHe has described the Dylan in his movie as 'a wanderer who comes in from Minnesota with a fresh name and a fresh outlook on life.'\n\nDylan memorably first performed using an electric guitar at the festival, where he sent shockwaves through the crowd after previously only using acoustic\n\nChalamet is seen walking through the streets of New York's Manhattan, passing some of Dylan's favoured venues, including Cafe Wha? and Hotel Chelsea\n\nThe trailer opens with Edward Norton as Pete Seeger (pictured), recalling the first time he saw and heard Dylan in action\n\nChalamet, who revealed he will be doing his own singing, also performs a power rendition of the 1963 hit, A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\n\nHis arrival ignites an 'upheaval in the folk community and what they thought was proper folk and illicit folk.'\n\nThe real-life Dylan, 83, serves as an executive producer of the film and gave notes on the script and took multiple meetings with Mangold.\n\nA source said: 'There's a lot of pressure to get it right. Bob Dylan fans are insane and will tear him [Timothee] apart if he gets it wrong.'\n\nRaising the stakes even higher, Chalamet's performance in Wonka - a musical fantasy film reimagining the 1964 novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - was universally panned by critics.\n\nNew York Magazine declared that he was 'the worst part of Wonka.' Rolling Stone wrote that Chalamet 'bit off more than he could chew.'\n\nThat was a rare but stinging piece of criticism for a young man whose star has only risen nearly unimpeded for nearly a decade.\n\nHe first rocketed to fame starring in the 2017 coming-of-age romantic drama, Call Me by Your Name.

Although the film doesn't have an official release date yet, director James Mangold hinted that it could premiere as soon as December 2024.\n\nThe movie chronicles Bob Dylan's formative years in New York, his rising fame, and his iconic 1965 performance at the Newport Folk Festival where he famously \"went electric.\"\n\nWitness Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet like never before -- strumming a guitar and passionately singing Bob Dylan's 1963 folk classic \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\" as he portrays the young Dylan's ascent to fame in 1960s New York City.\n\nIn his first in-depth interview with Rolling Stone, the director James Mangold delved into the upcoming film and praised Chalamet's \"immense talent.\"\n\n\"I think one of the things Timmy is so brilliant at playing in the movie and something I think Bob related to me, is a true feeling -- which is that it's also about, how does one deal with that burden? How you yourself, if you have this power, aren't even sure exactly where it's coming from -- you're trying to protect it and cherish it, but you're also not sure if it will lift you or destroy you. And so there's an ambivalent relationship for all the characters with this idea of immense talent.\"\n\nJoining Chalamet in the cast is Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo, a fictional character inspired by Bob Dylan's real-life girlfriend and muse, Suze Rotolo. Edward Norton takes on the role of fellow folk musician Pete Seeger, while Monica Barbaro portrays a young Joan Baez. Additionally, Boyd Holbrook is rumored to be playing Johnny Cash.\n\n'A Complete Unknown' is expected to hit theaters in December.

This controversial performance was met with a variety of reactions from anger to cheers. According to TIME, some audience members were dancing, some were crying, and others were simply overwhelmed by the \"ferocious shock of the music.\"\n\nStarring alongside Chalamet and Norton in the upcoming film are Boyd Holbrook as Johnny Cash and Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo among others.\n\nThe film is expected to premier in the United States in December.

They are toying with forces they do not understand,\" another fan joked, while a third fan wrote, \"Everyone updating their Oscar predictions to include Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet now.\"\n\nNot all reactions were positive, however, as one fan remarked, \"Hearing Bob Dylan's voice come from Timothee Chalamet is so... I can't take this seriously I'm sorry,\" and another viewer wrote, \"A Razzie Nom is coming.\"\n\nThe movie follows Dylan's early years in New York City and his rise to fame in the 1960s. Elle Fanning co-stars as Dylan's then-girlfriend, Sylvie Russo, Edward Norton co-stars as Pete Seeger, and Boyd Holbrook plays Johnny Cash.\n\nDirector James Mangold told Rolling Stone that he thought Chalamet's performance was \"miraculous.\"\n\nHe added, \"And there were also moments where it felt like something was getting channeled. I don't mean in mimicry. I mean in feeling.\"\n\nHe continued, \"But there were also moments where Timmy would come up to me and go, 'I think I lost Bob a little' or I'd say, when that happens, 'You're losing him a little bit.' And that was our code for drifting too much into yourself and not carrying some of those affectations and mannerisms that are part and parcel of being him.\"\n\nMangold told the outlet that he thought Chalamet showed Dylan's \"almost genetically predisposed discomfort with what his own great achievements then bring upon him and that, in terms of people wanting things, transactional relationships, or relationships that are tainted by the immense power and talent.\"\n\nWhen the real Bob Dylan, 83, asked Mangold what the movie will be about, Mangold recalled telling the legendary musician, \"It's about a guy who's choking to death in Minnesota, and leaves behind all his friends and family and reinvents himself in a brand new place, makes new friends, builds a new family, becomes phenomenally successful, starts to choke to death again -- and runs away.\"\n\nMangold told the outlet that Dylan replied, \"I like that.\"\n\nThe trailer ends with Dylan performing a song for Seeger and his family, as Seeger's daughter tells Dylan that his song is a \"good start.\"\n\n\"Timmy really carries this character from a 19-year-old boy telling tales of working on the carnival into this person that we recognize as an icon,\" said Mangold.\n\n\"Timmy finds the path to carry us there. It's going to be impossible for people in trailers or teasers or photos to see, but the way he grows this character is a real act of acting brilliance in my opinion.\"\n\n\"A Complete Unknown\" does not yet have an announced premiere date.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Rain's_a-Gonna_Fall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Raspberry_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden Raspberry Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyd_Holbrook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boyd Holbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elle Fanning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Seeger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Cash", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Cash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward Norton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cultural icon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/1960s-trailer-meets-edward-norton-85917675.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759626", "eventUri": "eng-9759626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

And could easily define the rest of his career. The trailer is simple, showing glimpses of Dylan's life from his childhood to his infamous haunts around New York City. The whole thing is narrated by Edward Norton in such a way that you're transported to a different dimension for a moment, one where things are far simpler than right here, right now.\n\nThe synopsis reads: \"Set in the influential New York music scene of the early 60s, A Complete Unknown follows 19-year-old Minnesota musician Bob Dylan's ... meteoric rise as a folk singer to concert halls and the top of the charts - his songs and mystique becoming a worldwide sensation - culminating in his groundbreaking electric rock and roll performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965,\" according to Deadline.\n\nThe film also stars Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo, Monica Barbaro as Joan Baez, Boyd Holbrook as Johnny Cash, Nick Offerman, Scoot McNairy, and more, according to IMDB. (RELATED: Cinema Returns To Pure Action-Packed Hilarious Escapism In 'The Fall Guy' Trailer)\n\nI would argue that most people under the age of 30 don't care about who Bob Dylan is, and most probably won't care ... until they see this film.

The actor went from a total unknown to headlining one of the biggest franchises in the world, and he has become beloved both by critics and by a legion of fans of all ages.\n\nNow, Chalamet is back with his latest project, and this time, he's taking on an icon. The first trailer for A Complete Unknown gives us a look at Chalamet's Bob Dylan. The movie, which was directed by James Mangold, focuses on Dylan in the early part of his career in New York City and is set to conclude with the moment he \"went electric\" during a performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965.\n\nA COMPLETE UNKNOWN | Official Teaser | Searchlight Pictures\n\nThe trailer includes looks at some of Dylan's most famous hangout spots, including Cafe Wha?, the Gaslight, and the Chelsea Hotel. We also get to hear Chalamet doing his best Dylan singing \"A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall,\" and we get glimpses of Elle Fanning's Sylvie Russo and Monica Barbaro's Joan Baez. Fanning appears to be playing a fictional version of Dylan's real girlfriend Suze Rotolo.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe cast also includes Edward Norton as Pete Seeger, Boyd Holbrook as Johnny Cash, P. J. Byrne as Harold Leventhal, Scoot McNairy as Woody Guthrie, and Dan Fogler as Albert Grossman.\n\nThe film is based on the book Dylan Goes Electric by Elijah Wald, and its title is a lyric from \"Like a Rolling Stone,\" the song that redefined Dylan's legacy. Making a movie about Dylan is a major gamble, both because he's already a ubiquitous force in the culture and because he has worked hard to make himself fundamentally unknowable. We'll see if A Complete Unknown can change that picture.\n\nEditors' Recommendations The final 'Deadpool & Wolverine' trailer sees the return of a key 'Logan' character Deadpool's variant in new 'Deadpool & Wolverine' trailer is on all fours A Bob Ross original from his first show heads to auction, bids start at $9.8 million Bob Odenkirk fights a goose (and other nuggets from the 'Lucky Hank' trailers) 'Love and Thunder' Trailer Features New Thor and Mjolnir", "source": {"uri": "themanual.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manual"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_allen@themanual.com", "name": "Joe Allen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searchlight_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Searchlight Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Rain_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hard Rain (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Barbaro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monica Barbaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafe_Wha?", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cafe Wha?"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suze_Rotolo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suze Rotolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elle Fanning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newport Folk Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joan Baez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Chelsea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel Chelsea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Leventhal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harold Leventhal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._J._Byrne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P.

The film, by James Mangold, co-stars Edward Norton, Elle Fanning, Monica Barbaro, Boyd Holbrook, Dan Fogler, Norbert Leo Butz and Scoot McNairy.\n\nA Complete Unknown is an upcoming American biographical drama film which is directed by James Mangold and written by Mangold and Jay Cocks, based on the 2015 book Dylan Goes Electric! by Elijah Wald. The film concerns the controversy surrounding Bob Dylan's switch to electrically amplified instrumentation.\n\nIn the clip shared by Searchlight Pictures, Timoth\u00e9e can be seen on-stage strumming his guitar while crooning away for a packed audience. And fans were gobsmacked by how seamlessly the American-French actor performed as the iconic musician.\n\nOne person penned on X: \"Judging by the facial expressions while singing I can tell Timoth\u00e9e has put on the work, that along with the cinematography and a trailer that is not too flashy makes me think we're in for a treat!\"\n\nWhile another said: \"Jaw dropped. Wow. Kept reminding myself all throughout watching the trailer that Todd Hayne's I'M NOT THERE is still a forgotten masterpiece about the many Bob Dylans. But Chalamet seems to be knocking hard at Uncle Oscar's door with this one. Knock, knock, knocking...\"\n\nA third then penned: \"Well this looks amazing. Timothee Chalamet really is hitting the spot with his great movie choices. Altho I wonder if this could succeed at the box-office.\" While a fourth added: \"Honestly not that bad of a Dylan impersonation.\"\n\nAnd a fifth praised: \"Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet sounds so incredible as Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown! He has such a great vocal range as his voice sounds completely different from Wonka! This film looks absolutely so beautiful as James Mangold is making sure that this is a great biopic like Walk The Line!\"\n\nBut others weren't as complimentary. One person brutally slammed: \"That singing ain't it.\" Another then critiqued: \"I can already tell Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is not Bob Dylan.\" While a third said: \"Looks nothing like him.\"\n\nTimmy, who has recently been romantically linked to Kylie Jenner, began his career as a teenager. His first acting gig was on television, with him appearing in the drama series Homeland in 2012.\n\nHe has since appeared in the likes of Dune, Wonka, Little Women, Interstellar and many more.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mollie_quirk@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Mollie Quirk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyd_Holbrook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boyd Holbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoot_McNairy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scoot McNairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Fogler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Fogler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cocks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jay Cocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elle Fanning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Leo_Butz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norbert Leo Butz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edward Norton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searchlight_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Searchlight Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonka_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wonka (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vocal range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Women", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Little Women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homeland (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interstellar (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kylie Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33318145.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN_timothee-chalamet.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759626", "eventUri": "eng-9759626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

A few months back my friend Woody Guthrie and I, we met a young man, he dropped in us out of nowhere, and he played us a song, in that moment we got a feeling we were getting a glimpse of the future.\"\n\nChalamet then performs A Hard Rain's A\u2010Gonna Fall, playing a guitar with his face still in shadow until his profile is revealed and he is seen wearing a tan jacket and shirt.\n\nThis is interspersed with clips of him at a church venue, where he looks at The Great actress Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo, a character based on Suze Rotolo, an artist who was part of the Greenwich Village scene along with Dylan and was his girlfriend in the early 1960s.\n\nFanning gives him a peck on the cheek, before Chalamet is also seen kissing Top Gun: Maverick actress Monica Barbaro as folk singer and counterculture figure Joan Baez, with whom he would sing duets such as With God On Our Side.\n\nThe movie is directed by James Mangold, who also directed the critically acclaimed Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line starring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, which was nominated for five Oscars, winning one for best actress for Witherspoon.\n\nIts description reads: \"Set in the influential New York music scene of the early 60s, A Complete Unknown follows 19-year-old Minnesota musician Bob Dylan's (Timothee Chalamet) meteoric rise as a folk singer to concert halls and the top of the charts - his songs and mystique becoming a worldwide sensation - culminating in his groundbreaking electric rock and roll performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965.\"\n\nDuring the early 1960s, Dylan was at the forefront of folk music being revived in the US through the albums Bob Dylan, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan and The Times They Are A-Changin' which relied on acoustic guitar music.\n\nIn 1965's Bringing It All Back Home, he shifted to working with electronic instruments and his set at the Newport Folk Festival was criticised for being very loud, including from Seeger, who he had been close to.\n\nBorn Robert Zimmerman in Duluth, Minnesota, he was the first songwriter to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016, with the Swedish academy crediting him with \"having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\".\n\nHis songs have been recorded more than 6,000 times, with artists as varied as The Byrds, Jimi Hendrix and Adele finding both commercial and critical success with covers.\n\nDylan has to date sold more than 125 million records globally and won a best original song Oscar in 2001 for Things Have Changed, which he wrote for the film Wonder Boys.\n\nHe has been previously depicted in 2007's I'm Not There, which saw various actors portray Dylan including Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Richard Gere and the late Heath Ledger.\n\nA Netflix documentary, Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story By Martin Scorsese, saw him do an on-camera interview, thought to be his first in a decade for the film.", "source": {"uri":

He is responsible for such songs as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"Like a Rolling Stone.\" Many consider him to be one of the greatest songwriters of all time, and he has both a Pulitzer and a Nobel for his lyrics.\n\nPer Deadline, the film tracks Dylan's rise from teenage musician to global figure, its climax set in 1965 when he controversially went electric. Mangold told Collider that he considered 1965 to be \"such an amazing time in American culture...A young 19-year-old Bob Dylan coming to New York with two dollars in his pocket and becoming a worldwide sensation within three years. First being embraced into a family of folk music in New York and of course kind of outrunning them at a certain point as his star rises so beyond belief...It's such an interesting true story and about such an interesting moment in the American scene. Different characters from Woody Guthrie to Bob Dylan to Pete Seeger to Joan Baez -- they all have a role to play in this movie.\"\n\nWho else is in it?\n\nIn addition to Chalamet, the cast includes Elle Fanning as Bob Dylan's girlfriend Sylvie Russo, Top Gun star Monica Barbaro as musician Joan Baez, Nick Offerman as Alan Lomax, Edward Norton as Pete Seeger, P.J. Byrne as music promoter Harol Leventhal, and Boyd Holbrook as Johnny Cash.\n\nYup. And according to IndieWire, the actor also took guitar lessons for the role. One thing he can't do \"for real,\" unfortunately, is be a short king. Bob Dylan's height is five-foot-seven, while Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's height is an un-changeable five-ten.\n\nCan I hear him please?\n\nSure. In the first A Complete Unknown trailer (well, teaser), released on July 24, Chalamet performs \"A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall,\" and his voice, while close enough to Dylan's, is also recognizably Timmyish.\n\nThe trailer doesn't give too much away, though it does tease a love triangle between Dylan, Russo, and Baez.\n\nWhen is the Bob Dylan biopic release date?\n\nNo specific date has been set, but Searchlight Pictures is aiming for an awards-friendly December release.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_logan@yahoo.com", "name": "Elizabeth Logan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Like a Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowin'_in_the_Wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blowin' in the Wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collider_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Collider (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Seeger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Guthrie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woody Guthrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joan Baez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searchlight_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Searchlight Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Barbaro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monica Barbaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gun_(soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Top Gun (soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyd_Holbrook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boyd Holbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Lomax", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alan Lomax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Offerman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Offerman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elle Fanning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Cash", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Cash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndieWire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IndieWire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edward Norton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YyYHBvwq4N_dryQP3q1o3A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04OTI7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/glamour_497/9e7f9009e3945810408bfef76101c688", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759626", "eventUri": "eng-9759626", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 1799, "textEnd": 1806}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

He's starring as Bob Dylan in James Mangold's A Complete Unknown, and was spotted filming the biopic in Manhattan this month. Finally, we can see the results of Chalamet's extensive prep for the role, which apparently included jamming out to \"like a 12-hour playlist\" of unreleased Dylan songs. A Complete Unknown centers on the fateful Newport Music Festival during which Dylan went electric. The moment has been depicted previously in Todd Haynes's I'm Not There. Also kinda in Factory Girl? But let Lil Timmy T sing you a little something anyway ...\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet slips into the rock-star lifestyle and a pretty good vocal impression. Unlike some trailers of late, his live version of \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\" carries the story through glimpses of Dylan's emotionally tumultuous rise to superstardom.\n\nFilming wrapped by early July, with photos showing Chalamet on set standing by a car in sunglasses and reading on a bench.\n\nMangold previously slipped Deadline deets on the project at Cannes last May while promoting Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, with the director announcing that Benedict Cumberbatch would be playing folk legend Pete Seeger in the film. Seeger was on the ground floor of Dylan standom, supporting the singer before he got famous and inviting him to Newport in the first place. However, reportedly due to scheduling conflicts, Ed Norton ended up stepping in as replacement -- and there are pictures of him strumming a banjo to prove it.\n\nJoining Chalamet and Norton will be Top Gun: Maverick's Monica Barbaro as Joan Baez and Elle Fanning as a fictionalized Dylan paramour of the early '60s. Boyd Holbrook will do his best Johnny Cash, the director revealed in a new interview with Rolling Stone. Deadline also reported a slew of other additions, including Scoot McNairy, Dan Fogler, Will Harrison, Charlie Tahan, P.J. Byrne, Eli Brown, Nick Pupo, Big Bill Morganfield, Laura Kariuki, Eric Berryman, David Alan Basche, Joe Tippett, and James Austin Johnson. No character details were disclosed in this casting dump. Sadly for Chalamet, Austin Butler still isn't onboard.\n\nYes, indeed! Mangold confirmed Chalamet and Barbaro recorded live takes as Dylan and Baez in an interview with Rolling Stone. \"But it's not [like] if one of our actors hit a bad note, I don't have an alternative take or the ability to replace that one beat,\" he said. \"If Timmy's brave enough to stand out there and make himself vulnerable, throwing himself at this, I should be brave enough to stand behind the camera and shoot.\" Plus, multiple COVID-related production delays and false starts gave Chalamet and Barbaro time to hone their musical chops. \"Timmy was a partner in this,\" Mangold said. \"He very much wanted to.\"\n\nThe release date for A Complete Unknown is not a complete unknown. Mangold accelerated the postproduction schedules in the hopes that it will arrive onscreen this year around December.", "source": {"uri": "vulture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vulture"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bethy_squires@vulture.com", "name": "Bethy Squires", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport,_Rhode_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Newport, Rhode Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newport, Rhode Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I'm_Not_There_(soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "I'm Not There (soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Rain's_a-Gonna_Fall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Seeger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Haynes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Todd Haynes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam_session", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jam session"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Dial_of_Destiny", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Barbaro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monica Barbaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._W._Norton_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "W.

Searchlight Pictures has finally released the first trailer for A Complete Unknown, the biopic about Dylan from Oscar-nominated filmmaker James Mangold, whose film about June Carter and Johnny Cash won Reese Witherspoon an Academy Award.\n\nChalamet's Dylan, a character crafted with help from Austin Butler's Elvis team, is smoking in his signature dark sunglasses, strolling with a guitar case around New York City's Greenwich Village, and singing \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,\" a song recorded for Dylan's 1963 album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan.\n\nWritten by Mangold and Jay Cocks, A Complete Unknown follows a 19-year-old Dylan upon his move to New York in 1961, and culminates in his historic performance at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Chalamet stars alongside Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo, a fictional girlfriend inspired by the musician's real-life former girlfriend Suze Rotolo; Monica Barbaro as troubadour and activist Joan Baez; Boyd Holbrook as country legend Johnny Cash; and Edward Norton as folk musician Pete Seeger, whose words open the trailer.\n\nIn a new interview with Rolling Stone, Mangold said that during the film's preproduction process, he \"never even planned on meeting Bob, honestly,\" adding, \"That just came about because he read the script and wanted to see me.\" During their initial conversation, Dylan reportedly asked the director to share the project's synopsis. \"I said, 'It's about a guy who's choking to death in Minnesota, and leaves behind all his friends and family and reinvents himself in a brand-new place, makes new friends, builds a new family, becomes phenomenally successful, starts to choke to death again -- and runs away,'\" Mangold remembered.\n\nDylan smiled at his answer, the filmmaker recalled, noting that he said, \"I like that.\"\n\nMangold also revealed that the actors' live vocals will be featured in the movie. \"But it's not [like] if one of our actors hit a bad note, I don't have an alternative take or the ability to replace that one beat,\" he said. \"If Timmy's brave enough to stand out there and make himself vulnerable, throwing himself at this, I should be brave enough to stand behind the camera and shoot.\"\n\nAs for the performance from Chalamet, whom Mangold said he's \"used to calling Bob sometimes,\" the actor \"does an incredible job of growing the character up, because one of the things I think that will be startling is, most Dylan fans don't focus on the boy in the newsboy cap who's arriving in town.\" The director added, \"It's going to be impossible for people in trailers or teasers or photos to see, but the way he grows this character is a real act of acting brilliance in my opinion.\"\n\nThe film will arrive in theaters this December -- just in time for an awards season push. \"You can't release a movie like this in February or March,\" Mangold explained. \"And then it's the summer and then you'd go to some festivals or something like that and come out the following fall. But I love the creative momentum of just charging toward an audience, headlong.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Cash", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Cash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searchlight_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Searchlight Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Rain's_a-Gonna_Fall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cocks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jay Cocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reese_Witherspoon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reese Witherspoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Carter_Cash", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "June Carter Cash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elvis Presley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Village", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenwich Village"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greenwich Village"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyd_Holbrook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boyd Holbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suze_Rotolo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suze Rotolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elle Fanning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newport Folk Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Seeger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward Norton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joan Baez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Watch-Timothee-Chalamet-Sing-as-Bob-Dylan-in-First-'A.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759626", "eventUri": "eng-9759626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

It opens with a familiar bent figure walking on a wet sidewalk on a dark New York City street. Then: \"Oh where have you been, my blue-eyed son,\" Chalamet sings, alone beneath a spotlight, the opening lines to one of his most popular songs.\n\nCollider reported more than a year ago that Chalamet would do his own signing in the movie; There is already chatter about the young actor's chances at winning an Oscar.\n\nThe Searchlight Pictures film is set in the New York music scene in the early 1960s, when the young musician who was born in Duluth and raised in Hibbing, Minn., is beginning to top charts. Based on the book \"Dylan Goes Electric!\" by Dylan Wald, it ends with a defining performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965, according to the official synopsis. This is the performance where Dylan traded in his acoustic set for amplified rock 'n' roll -- a defining moment in his career.\n\nAccording to IMDB, the cast also includes Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo, seen in the trailer clutching Chalamet's arm in a recreation of \"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\" album cover. Monica Barbaro is Joan Baez, Edward Norton is Pete Seeger, Boyd Holbrook is Johnny Cash and Scoot McNairy is Woody Guthrie. Dylan is an executive producer on the biopic that, according to Rolling Stone, could be released as early as December in the United States.\n\nAs part of his research for the role, Chalamet visited northern Minnesota in January. He stopped in Duluth and ordered black drip coffee and a sandwich from a local coffee shop. He also made his way to Hibbing, Minn., where Dylan lived until after he graduated from high school. Chalamet met with drama students in the historic auditorium -- where Dylan had one of his earliest public performances.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star

It also includes, as promised, Chalamet doing his own singing. In the clip, the actor does Dylan's '60s classic \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall,\" and he actually sounds pretty solid! His voice is a little shinier than the real Dylan (that's movie magic for you) but honestly not the trainwreck some seemed to be expecting.\n\nThe teaser trailer also features Monica Barbaro as Joan Baez, Edward Norton as Pete Seeger and Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo.\n\nDirected by James Mangold, A Complete Unknown arrives in theatres in December. It follows Dylan's early years in New York, his rise to fame and his infamous 1965 Newport Folk Festival performance, where he \"went electric.\"\n\nCheck out the teaser below.", "source": {"uri": "exclaim.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Exclaim.ca"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Rain's_a-Gonna_Fall", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Barbaro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monica Barbaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elle Fanning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newport Folk Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Seeger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edward Norton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joan Baez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Puppetry", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Puppetry", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://assets.exclaim.ca/image/upload/v1721831122/timmy_bob_dylan_trailer_69d5718e6c.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759626", "eventUri": "eng-9759626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The movie, which takes place in the early days of Dylan's career, is set against the 1960s New York folk scene. The trailer features Edward Norton as Pete Seeger, providing a framing device, while in between the Seeger sections, a young Bob Dylan plays \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,\" a song from his 1963 album The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. The trailer suggests the movie will depict a love triangle between Dylan's onetime girlfriend Suze Rotolo, who was featured on the cover of that album, and folk legend Joan Baez, played in the film by Monica Barbaro.\n\nRotolo is not in the movie -- technically. Elle Fanning plays Sylvie Russo, a fictional character who will stand in for Rotolo. You can see the trailer below.\n\nThe relationship with Rotolo -- widely regarded as a \"muse\" behind a number of early Dylan songs -- ended badly, and Dylan famously released an 8-minute song attacking her family, who were never supportive of the romance. In the 2007 film I'm Not There, where a number of actors play characters based on Dylan, Heath Ledger played a character whose relationship with Charlotte Gainsbourg's Claire was loosely based on the Dylan/Rotolo romance. In that movie, Ledger and Gainsbourg recreated the cover of A Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, which is arguably the most famous single image of the singer's career. During her life, Rotolo was never happy to have her entire public persona defined by the three-year relationship with Dylan, but she did later use a cropped version of the image on the cover of her autobiography.\n\nDuring the years the movie took place, Dylan became the mot famous folk singer in the world, rising to fame, and ultimately alienating many of his friends and much of his target audience when he plugged in to play rock at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. It seems likely, with a riff on the doomed Rotolo relationship and the clear indications that Dylan's affair with Baez will appear onscreen, that this is a movie with a pretty big rise-and-fall structure.\n\nHere's the official synopsis for the film:\n\nSet in the influential New York music scene of the early 60s, A Complete Unknown follows 19-year-old Minnesota musician BOB DYLAN's (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) meteoric rise as a folk singer to concert halls and the top of the charts - his songs and mystique becoming a worldwide sensation - culminating in his groundbreaking electric rock and roll performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965.\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet is Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.

Stellar supporting cast includes Edward Norton and Elle Fanning portraying iconic musicians in the biopic. Searchlight Pictures aims for Oscars with the film's release in December 2024, building buzz around Chalamet's potential nomination.\n\nOur first look at Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as legendary musician Bob Dylan has finally been unveiled in the trailer for Searchlight Pictures' A Complete Unknown. Directed by James Mangold (Logan), the biopic follows Bob Dylan's incredible rise from unknown folk singer to playing in concert halls and topping the charts, culminating in his groundbreaking but controversial performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965. Mangold also serves as the film's producer and co-writer alongside Jay Cocks, a frequent Martin Scorsese collaborator who wrote the scripts for Gangs of New York and Silence.\n\nYou can check out the newly released trailer for A Complete Unknown below.\n\nThe supporting cast is filled with great performers playing legendary musicians: Edward Norton (Fight Club) is \"Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season)\" singer Pete Seeger, Monica Barbaro (Top Gun: Maverick) is \"Diamonds & Rust\" singer Joan Baez, Elle Fanning (Neon Demon) is artist Suze Rotolo, and Boyd Holbrook (Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny) is Johnny Cash. The iconic country singer's inclusion is fitting as Mangold also directed the 2005 Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line, for which Joaquin Phoenix earned an Academy Award nomination and Reese Witherspoon won an Oscar.\n\nA Complete Unknown's Oscar Chances A Complete Unknown BiographyDramaMusic Director James Mangold Cast Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet , Elle Fanning , Edward Norton , Monica Barbaro Main Genre Biography Writers Jay Cocks , James Mangold Studio(s) Searchlight Pictures , The Picture Company , Automatik Entertainment Distributor(s) Searchlight Pictures Expand\n\nA Complete Unknown has not set a release date outside of December 2024. Searchlight Pictures is clearly aiming for an Oscar play, as Mangold has had incredible luck with films like Walk the Line, which earned five Oscar nominations, and Ford v. Ferrari, which earned four nominations, including Best Picture. Chalamet is a beloved actor who was previously nominated for Best Actor in 2018 for Call Me By Your Name. Playing a well-known musician might earn him another nomination and a potential win if the film is well-received.\n\nRelated 20 Bob Dylan Needle Drops That Prove Why He's the Most Featured Artist in Movies\n\nThroughout the years, Bob Dylan's haunting lyrics and dulcet vocals have provided dozens of movie scenes with the perfect atmosphere.\n\nThe road to release A Complete Unknown has not been easy. Mangold and Chalamet joined the project in January 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic put the project on hold as Mangold's next film, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, was delayed. Filming was originally slated to begin in August 2023 after Mangold finished press for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, but the SAG-AFTRA strike began on July 14, 2023, which delayed filming until April 2024. Filming recently wrapped earlier this month, and Searchlight Pictures has quickly cut together a trailer to start building the potential Oscar buzz.\n\nSearchlight Pictures rolling out the marketing for A Complete Unknown now feels appropriate, as the trailer can now play in front of Deadpool & Wolverine, netting a wider audience. It's especially fitting since Mangold previously directed both The Wolverine and Logan.

Thus far, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's career has been one of thrilling roles -- and his latest, Bob Dylan in the James Mangold-directed A Complete Unknown, is no different. Here's everything we know so far.\n\nYes! Watch the first teaser below.\n\nWhile the plot is still largely under wraps, we know that the film will follow a 19-year-old Dylan's first arrival in New York City from Minnesota, as he seeks a career in music and soon skyrockets to worldwide fame. \"It's such an amazing time in American culture and the story of a young 19-year-old Bob Dylan coming to New York with, like, two dollars in his pocket and becoming a worldwide sensation within three years,\" Mangold told Collider during a red-carpet interview in April 2023. \"First being embraced into the family of folk music in New York, and kind of outrunning them at a certain point as his star rises so beyond belief.\"\n\nA trailer is quite far off. Despite A Complete Unknown being in development for nearly five years now -- Chalamet's casting was first announced in 2020, but filming was delayed first due to COVID, and then the SAG-AFTRA strikes -- production has only just begun.\n\nJoining Chalamet will be Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo, Dylan's fictional girlfriend, inspired by the musician's real-life former girlfriend and muse Suze Rotolo. Edward Norton will play Dylan's fellow folk musician Pete Seeger, Monica Barbaro will play a young Joan Baez and Boyd Holbrook is rumoured to play Johnny Cash.\n\nHe can act, he can dance and yes, he can sing -- Chalamet confirmed in a December 2023 interview that 70% of the soundtrack had already been recorded in a Californian studio with Nick Baxter, the film's music supervisor. In the same interview, the actor also revealed that Dylan's manager, Jeff Rosen, sent Chalamet 12 hours of unreleased Bob Dylan music from 1959 to 1964. \"This might earn the ire and wrath of a lot of Bob fans, rightfully,\" Chalamet pre-warned.\n\nAccording to local New Jersey news outlets, the film is recreating Woodstock, New York, in various parts of northern New Jersey.\n\nThe film will hit theaters this December, though an exact date is still to be confirmed.\n\nListen to Bob Dylan's back catalogue, of course -- and watch Todd Haynes's experimental Bob Dylan biopic I'm Not There.",

As director James Mangold promised, Chalamet does his own singing in the biopic, Pitchfork reports. In the trailer, he sings Dylan's 1962 song \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall.\"\n\nThe movie, which tells the story of Dylan's early years as a musician, starting when the then-19-year-old arrived in New York City in the early 1960s, is due out in December. According to the official description, it culminates \"in his groundbreaking electric rock and roll performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965.\" Mangold tells Rolling Stone that because of delays including \"false starts with COVID,\" Chalamet, 28, \"really had a kind of incubation as a musician that was years in happening.\"\n\n\"I think he does an incredible job of growing the character up, because one of the things I think that will be startling is, most Dylan fans don't focus on the boy in the newsboy cap who's arriving in town,\" Mangold says. \"And Timmy really carries this character from a 19-year-old boy telling tales of working on the carnival into this person that we recognize as an icon.\" The Independent reports that fans were fawning over the portrayal of Dylan by Chalamet, whose other recent movies include Wonka and the Dune films.

Which is an act of, by nature, reduction -- reducing someone to a simple epiphany, a plot-point Freudian history of their life.\" Read the interview in full here.", "source": {"uri": "brooklynvegan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BrooklynVegan"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amanda_hatfield@brooklynvegan.com", "name": "Amanda Hatfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Barbaro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monica Barbaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Rain's_a-Gonna_Fall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyd_Holbrook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boyd Holbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoot_McNairy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scoot McNairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Fogler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dan Fogler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elle Fanning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Seeger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Leo_Butz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Norbert Leo Butz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward Norton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joan Baez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newport Folk Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sigmund Freud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film_Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film Festivals", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.brooklynvegan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/24/bobdylanfilm-MacallPolay-Searchlight.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759626", "eventUri": "eng-9759626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

He is responsible for such songs as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"Like a Rolling Stone.\" Many consider him to be one of the greatest songwriters of all time, and he has both a Pulitzer and a Nobel for his lyrics.\n\nJames Mangold (Walk the Line, Girl, Interrupted) directs from a script he wrote with Jay Cocks (De Lovely, The Age of Innocence).\n\nPer Deadline, the film tracks Dylan's rise from teenage musician to global figure, its climax set in 1965 when he controversially went electric. Mangold told Collider that he considered 1965 to be \"such an amazing time in American culture...A young 19-year-old Bob Dylan coming to New York with two dollars in his pocket and becoming a worldwide sensation within three years. First being embraced into a family of folk music in New York and of course kind of outrunning them at a certain point as his star rises so beyond belief...It's such an interesting true story and about such an interesting moment in the American scene. Different characters from Woody Guthrie to Bob Dylan to Pete Seeger to Joan Baez -- they all have a role to play in this movie.\"\n\nIn addition to Chalamet, the cast includes Elle Fanning as Bob Dylan's girlfriend Sylvie Russo, Top Gun star Monica Barbaro as musician Joan Baez, Nick Offerman as Alan Lomax, Edward Norton as Pete Seeger, P.J. Byrne as music promoter Harol Leventhal, and Boyd Holbrook as Johnny Cash.\n\nYup. And according to IndieWire, the actor also took guitar lessons for the role. One thing he can't do \"for real,\" unfortunately, is be a short king. Bob Dylan's height is five-foot-seven, while Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's height is an un-changeable five-ten.\n\nSure. In the first A Complete Unknown trailer (well, teaser), released on July 24, Chalamet performs \"A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall,\" and his voice, while close enough to Dylan's, is also recognizably Timmyish.\n\nThe trailer doesn't give too much away, though it does tease a love triangle between Dylan, Russo, and Baez.\n\nNo specific date has been set, but Searchlight Pictures is aiming for an awards-friendly December release.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Innocence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Age of Innocence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Like a Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cocks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jay Cocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowin'_in_the_Wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blowin' in the Wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collider_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Collider (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Seeger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Guthrie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woody Guthrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joan Baez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searchlight_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Searchlight Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Barbaro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monica Barbaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gun_(soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Top Gun (soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._J._Byrne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P.

All the while, his stages and crowds get bigger and bigger.\n\nFans only get to hear the Dune star speak as Dylan once in the trailer, when the video cuts back to him working on \"A Hard Rain\" before his life changed forever. \"That's all I got so far,\" he grunts.\n\nThe trailer comes just four months after fans first spotted Chalamet filming as Dylan in New York. Last year, director James Mangold confirmed that the actor would do his own singing for the flick, which hits theaters this December.

It comes from film-maker James Mangold, who previously directed the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line.\n\nIt starts in New York City when Dylan arrives in 1961 and ends 72 hours after the Newport folk festival in 1965.\n\nThe film will include the actors singing, with Top Gun: Maverick star Monica Barbaro playing Joan Baez, Edward Norton as Pete Seeger and Boyd Holbrook as Johnny Cash. Elle Fanning also stars as Suze Rotolo, the artist who had a major influence on Dylan during that period. Mangold has called it \"a strong ensemble piece\".\n\n\"I'm much more interested in the wake that this person has left on others, as much as I'm interested in unpacking who he is in some kind of conventional movie-Freudian way,\" Mangold said to Rolling Stone.\n\nChalamet reportedly used his Dune: Part Two co-star Austin Butler's \"entire Elvis team\" to help transform himself. \"I just saw the way [Butler] committed to it all - and realised I needed to step it up,\" Chalamet said to GQ.\n\nHis vocal coach, Eric Vetro, who also worked with him on last year's hit musical Wonka, has called what he brings to the table to be the \"essence\" of Dylan. \"You're not getting an impersonation of him,\" he said. \"It's breathing new life into that voice that we know so well.\"\n\nMangold also said of Chalamet's performance: \"It's going to be impossible for people in trailers or teasers or photos to see, but the way he grows this character is a real act of acting brilliance in my opinion.\"\n\nDylan was previously brought to life on screen by actors including Cate Blanchett and Heath Ledger in Todd Haynes's unconventional 2007 drama I'm Not There.\n\nChalamet is coming off the back of the $711m box office success of Dune: Part Two and has recently signed on to play-ping pong player Marty Reisman in Marty Supreme, a film to be directed by Josh Safdie.\n\nA Complete Unknown, to be released in prime Oscar release territory, launches Chalamet into the best actor race alongside other predicted contenders such as Daniel Craig in Queer, Colman Domingo in Sing Sing and Joaquin Phoenix in Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benjamin_lee@theguardian.com", "name": "Benjamin Lee",

The biopic, directed by James Mangold, delves into the transformative period of Dylan's career, capturing the essence of an era and featuring Chalamet at his very best.\n\nChalamet is known for his talent as an actor. His deeply moving performance in Call Me By Your Name has stuck with audiences, and he has earned countless praise for his portrayal of the beloved Paul character in Dune. However, Bob Dylan brings on a new challenge, as the singer/songwriter is known for his iconic voice and mannerisms. Any apprehension fans may have had towards Chalamet playing the legendary musician should be eased with the new trailer for A Complete Unknown. His singing voice is uncanny to Dylan's, and the actor resembles him perfectly. This casting could not be better, and definitely showcases Chalamet's range as a performer.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "caroline_young@cinemablend.com", "name": "Caroline Young", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_Me_by_Your_Name_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Call Me by Your Name (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice_Actors", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice Actors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Puppetry", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Puppetry", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iUeEm55GuCgm25whyCMM4F-1200-80.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759626", "eventUri": "eng-9759626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

A few months back, my friend Woody Guthrie and I, we met a young man,\" Edward Norton - as the late Pete Seeger - tells a crowd. \"He dropped in on us out of nowhere and he played us a song.

At the time, it was reported that the Dune actor was taking guitar lessons in preparation for the role, with Mangold also confirming that Chalamet will do his own singing in the film.\n\nIn a previous interview with GQ, Chalamet revealed that before filming, he sought advice from Joel Coen, one half of the directing duo known as the Coen Brothers.\n\nChalamet said he was invited over for dinner at Coen's house, where he was able to question the director about his extensive research on Dylan for 2013's Inside Llewyn Davis, which was set in the folk music scene of the 1960s where the singer began his career. Dylan also briefly appeared as a character performing in the film.\n\n\"[Coen] almost seemed weary of even talking about this stuff, it was so big and potent,\" Chalamet explained. He went on to recall how Coen had argued that the sheer quantity of work Dylan produced during the early years of his career is what made him so singular.\n\nA Complete Unknown is scheduled for a theatrical release in December; an exact date is yet to be announced.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "inga_parkel@yahoo.com", "name": "Inga Parkel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Rain's_a-Gonna_Fall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Wald", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elijah Wald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Seeger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Guthrie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Woody Guthrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Women", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Little Women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edward Norton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Barbaro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monica Barbaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elle Fanning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joan Baez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Llewyn_Davis_(soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inside Llewyn Davis (soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_folk_music_revival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American folk music revival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Cash", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Cash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coen_brothers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coen brothers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibraphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vibraphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GQ"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/233adc2f17e7e12f5db5d7eaa4288f67", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759626", "eventUri": "eng-9759626", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 325, "textEnd": 332}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Director James Mangold previously directed Joaquin Phoenix as the \"Walk the Line\" singer but recast the role for his new movie.\n\nDuring an interview with Rolling Stone, Mangold had a simple reason for recasting the part of Cash.\n\n\"I don't do multiverses,\" Mangold said. \"But beyond that Johnny Cash was like, 30.\"\n\nHe continued by talking about Phoenix, who earned an Oscar nomination for his performance in Walk the Line. He also slammed the usage of multiverses in movies. Mangold called Easter eggs an \"intellectual act, not an emotional act.\"\n\n\"I love Joaquin, but he's not 30, or whatever Johnny was at this moment. They're both young people in that moment in life,\" Mangold explained. \"It's weird that I've even worked in the world of IP entertainment because I don't like multi-movie universe-building.\n\n\"I think it's the enemy of storytelling. The death of storytelling. It's more interesting to people the way the Legos connect than the way the story works in front of us,\" he continued.\n\nAs ford Holbrook's performance, Mangold made a bold promise. He said that Holbrook is \"fantastic\" as Cash and that viewers won't \"think about it [Joaquin Phoenix not playing the role] for a second.\"\n\n\"It's just, Oh, there's Johnny Cash and he's in Bob's life,\" Mangold said.\n\nWho is James Mangold?\n\nJames Mangold is an acclaimed director who wrote and directed the Johnny Cash biopic, Walk the Line, in 2005. He subsequently made 3:10 to Yuma, The Wolverine, and Logan.\n\nHis 2019 movie Ford v Ferrari was a big hit. It grossed over $220 million worldwide at the box office and was nominated for four Oscars, including Best Picture.\n\nHe followed that up with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, closing out Harrison Ford's tenure in the franchise. Mangold co-wrote the script with Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and David Koepp.\n\nDial of Destiny was a disappointment at the box office. It grossed just $383 million worldwide during its theatrical run.\n\nHolbrook previously appeared in Logan and Dial of Destiny. A Complete Unknown marks his third collaboration with the director.\n\nThe Bob Dylan biopic\n\nThe forthcoming Bob Dylan biopic, A Complete Unknown, was co-written and directed by Mangold. It is based on the 2015 book, Dylan Goes Electric!, written by Elijah Wald.\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet takes on the part of Bob Dylan and is even heard singing in the first trailer. Monica Barbaro, Elle Fanning, and Edward Norton will also star in the movie.\n\nSearchlight Pictures will distribute the Bob Dylan biopic. A Complete Unknown is set for a December 2024 release date.\n\nPer the studio, the synopsis reads: \"Set in the influential New York music scene of the early 60s, A Complete Unknown follows 19-year-old Minnesota musician Bob Dylan's (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) meteoric rise as a folk singer to concert halls and the top of the charts - his songs and mystique becoming a worldwide sensation - culminating in his groundbreaking electric rock and roll performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965.\"", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"},

Now, Mangold takes on another musical icon with the Bob Dylan biopic, A Complete Unknown. There has been a more abstract attempt at telling Dylan's story with Todd Haynes' 2007 film I'm Not There, which featured an all-star cast and multiple actors playing Bob Dylan in a different phase of his life with a unique interpretation, including Cate Blanchett sporting his iconic look.\n\nSearchlight Pictures has now dropped the trailer for A Complete Unknown, which stars Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Edward Norton, Elle Fanning and Monica Barbaro. The film also co-stars Boyd Holbrook, Dan Fogler, Norbert Leo Butz and Scoot McNairy. The synopsis reads,\n\nJames Mangold directs from a screenplay written by him and Jay Cocks, who is known for working with Martin Scorsese on projects such as Gangs of New York and Silence. Producers on the film include Range's Fred Berger, The Picture Company's Alex Heineman, Veritas Entertainment Group's Peter Jaysen, Bob Bookman, Alan Gasmer, Bob Dylan's longtime representative Jeff Rosen, Chalamet, and Mangold via his Turnpike Films.

(Also read: Timothee Chalamet to sing in Bob Dylan biopic, confirms director James Mangold)\n\nThe teaser begins with Edward Norton's character addressing a crowd that he is going to tell a story that started a few months ago, when he met a young man who dropped out of nowhere and started to play a song. In that moment, he knew that there lies a glimpse of a future. The scene cuts to Timotee singing A Hard Rain's A\u2010Gonna Fall to a stunned audience. What follows is a montage of scenes as this young man meets Elle Fanning's character, discovers his footing in a big city, and finds his voice.\n\nThe biopic follows the early years of the American singer-songwriter who goes on to become a global sensation. The official synopsis reads: \"Set in the influential New York music scene of the early '60s, 'A Complete Unknown' follows 19-year-old Minnesota musician Bob Dylan's (Chalamet) meteoric rise as a folk singer to concert halls and the top of the charts -- his songs and mystique becoming a worldwide sensation -- culminating in his groundbreaking electric rock and roll performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965.\" It stars Edward Norton, Elle Fanning and Monica Barbaro.\n\nReacting to the trailer, a fan commented: \"Oh my god, Timothee will rock this.

She's inspired by Dylan's real-life girlfriend in the early 60s, musician Suze Rotolo.\n\nThe trailer features a solid minute of Chalamet singing Dylan's \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,\" and thankfully, his singing is actually pretty good. It's clear it's not the real Bob Dylan's voice, but it's close enough that it's hard to complain. Director James Mangold confirmed last year that the actor would be doing his own singing in the film.\n\n\"Did Timoth\u00e9e sing the songs himself? If yes then incredible, it sounds so much like Dylan. Wow,\" responded one Twitter user. \"Uh oh.

A few months back my friend Woody Guthrie and I, we met a young man, he dropped in us out of nowhere, and he played us a song, in that moment we got a feeling we were getting a glimpse of the future.\"\n\nChalamet then performs A Hard Rain's A\u2010Gonna Fall, playing a guitar with his face still in shadow until his profile is revealed and he is seen wearing a tan jacket and shirt.\n\nThis is interspersed with clips of him at a church venue, where he looks at The Great actress Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo, a character based on Suze Rotolo, an artist who was part of the Greenwich Village scene along with Dylan and was his girlfriend in the early 1960s.\n\nFanning gives him a peck on the cheek, before Chalamet is also seen kissing Top Gun: Maverick actress Monica Barbaro as folk singer and counterculture figure Joan Baez, with whom he would sing duets such as With God On Our Side.\n\nThe movie is directed by James Mangold, who also directed the critically acclaimed Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line starring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, which was nominated for five Oscars, winning one for best actress for Witherspoon.\n\nDuring the early 1960s, Dylan was at the forefront of folk music being revived in the US through the albums Bob Dylan, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan and The Times They Are A-Changin' which relied on acoustic guitar music.\n\nIn 1965's Bringing It All Back Home, he shifted to working with electronic instruments and his set at the Newport Folk Festival was criticised for being very loud, including from Seeger, who he had been close to.\n\nBorn Robert Zimmerman in Duluth, Minnesota, he was the first songwriter to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016, with the Swedish academy crediting him with \"having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\".\n\nDylan has to date sold more than 125 million records globally and won a best original song Oscar in 2001 for Things Have Changed, which he wrote for the film Wonder Boys.\n\nHe has been previously depicted in 2007's I'm Not There, which saw various actors portray Dylan including Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Richard Gere and the late Heath Ledger.\n\nA Netflix documentary, Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story By Martin Scorsese, saw him do an on-camera interview, thought to be his first in a decade for the film.",

Nope. Chalamet-Dylan takes the stage a mere thirty seconds into the preview, brandishing a nearly pitch-perfect rendition of \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall.\" The trailer opens with Pete Seeger (Edward Norton) building up the mythos of the young Dylan, followed by a few glimpses of Dylan on stage, harmonica in tow. We also see Elle Fanning's Sylvie Russo, who is Dylan's romantic interest in the film. (According to Fanning, Russo is \"roughly based off\" the artist's ex-girlfriend, Suze Rotolo.) For now, though, let's just all appreciate that Chalamet's prep for his Dylan transformation -- more on that below -- paid off. You can watch the first trailer for A Complete Unknown above.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director James Mangold directs Chalamet in the film, which will debut this December. And, for those wondering, the film will follow Dylan's choice to perform an all-electric set at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. If you're not familiar with the historic and controversial set, know that Dylan's folk songs were celebrated as representation for the downtrodden. (See: \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" and \"Blowin' in the Wind.\") So, when Dylan unleashed his all-electric performance of \"Like a Rolling Stone\" at the famousevent, many music figures saw it as a major betrayal. As you can guess by the trailer, Chalamet will take on all of the film's singing duties, opposed to Elvis and Bohemian Rhapsody, which used the help of voice-blending technology.\n\nMangold is something of an expert in the music-legend biopic, also directing 2005's Johnny Cash film, Walk the Line. \"Timmy is working his ass off right as we speak,\" Mangold said on the Happy Sad Confused podcast in 2023. \"I couldn't have more confidence in him and in all the others joining in. Not unlike making an Indiana Jones movie, the expectations are high, but so is the camaraderie and the love among us. We've all been essentially working on this movie for the last three years. So there's been a lot of preparation. When COVID took us offline, no one stopped. Writing, rehearsing, Timmy playing guitar and working. Probably took it with him through every Dune, and probably was playing guitar as he was riding a worm.\"", "source": {"uri": "esquire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Esquire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_rosenberg@esquire.com", "name": "Josh Rosenberg", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nope_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nope (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Rain's_a-Gonna_Fall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elle Fanning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Seeger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edward Norton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harmonica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Dial_of_Destiny", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suze_Rotolo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suze Rotolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_They_Are_a-Changin'_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowin'_in_the_Wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blowin' in the Wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newport Folk Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Like a Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Rhapsody", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bohemian Rhapsody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Cash", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Cash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elvis Presley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/a-complete-unknown-official-teaser-66a0fe2c90264.jpg?crop=0.823xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759626", "eventUri": "eng-9759626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

He plays Bob Dylan in the James Mangold-directed musical biopic A Complete Unknown, which charts the rise of the folk singer-songwriter and his controversial switch from acoustic to electric guitar. \"A few weeks back, my friend Woody Guthrie and I, we met a young man, he dropped in on us out of nowhere and he played us a song,\" Peter Seeger (Edward Norton) introduces Dylan to the stage. \"In that moment, we got a feeling we were getting a glimpse of the future.\" The new trailer doesn't hit you over the head with plot points. Instead, it introduces you to Chalamet's Bob Dylan singing voice by way of a \"A Hard Rains A-Gonna Fall\" performance to an unseen, rapt audience. Chalamet imitates Dylan's gravelly voice with competence, likely making his online fan club swoon. As the song plays, girlfriend Sylvie Russo (Elle Fanning) appears, who eyes Dylan at a hootenanny and rides on the back of his motorcycle. Early Dylan champion and recording artist Joan Baez (Monica Barbaro), also saw an opportunity to hook up with him and took it.

Chalamet stars alongside Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo, a fictional girlfriend inspired by the musician's real-life former girlfriend Suze Rotolo; Monica Barbaro as troubadour and activist Joan Baez; Boyd Holbrook as country legend Johnny Cash; and Edward Norton as folk musician Pete Seeger, whose words open the trailer.\n\nIn a new interview with Rolling Stone, Mangold said that during the film's preproduction process, he had \"never even planned on meeting Bob, honestly,\" adding, \"That just came about because he read the script and wanted to see me.\" During their initial conversation, Dylan reportedly asked the director to share the project's synopsis. \"I said, 'It's about a guy who's choking to death in Minnesota, and leaves behind all his friends and family and reinvents himself in a brand-new place, makes new friends, builds a new family, becomes phenomenally successful, starts to choke to death again -- and runs away,'\" Mangold recalled.\n\nDylan smiled at his answer, the filmmaker said, noting that he said, \"I like that.\"\n\nMangold also revealed that the actors' live vocals will be featured in the movie. \"But it's not [like] if one of our actors hit a bad note, I don't have an alternative take or the ability to replace that one beat,\" he said. \"If Timmy's brave enough to stand out there and make himself vulnerable, throwing himself at this, I should be brave enough to stand behind the camera and shoot.\"\n\nAs for the performance from Chalamet, \"who I'm used to calling Bob sometimes,\" Mangold said, he \"does an incredible job of growing the character up. Because one of the things I think that will be startling is, most Dylan fans don't focus on the boy in the newsboy cap who's arriving in town.\" The director added, \"It's going to be impossible for people in trailers or teasers or photos to see, but the way he grows this character is a real act of acting brilliance in my opinion.\"\n\nThe film will arrive in theaters this December -- just in time for an awards season push. \"You can't release a movie like this in February or March,\" Mangold explained. \"And then it's the summer and then you'd go to some festivals or something like that and come out the following fall.

The clip clocks in at just under two minutes and provides a glimpse at the adapted onscreen history due in full this December.\n\nThe movie is set in early '60s New York City, capturing the vibrant and growing music scene that first entranced the Minnesota teenager. A Complete Unknown showcases Dylan's rise from folk singer to chart-topper, climaxing with the esteemed artist's groundbreaking electric set at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Notably, the movie serves as an adaptation of Elijah Wald's 2015 book, Dylan Goes Electric!\n\nDirected by James Mangold (Walk the Line, Ford v Ferrari), A Complete Unknown features other venerable musicians and critical players in Dylan's development, including Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo, a fictitious take on Suze Rotolo, Monica Barbaro as Joan Baez, Edward Norton taking on the role of Pete Segar, and other music greats including Scoot McNairy as Woody Guthrie, Boyd Holbrook as Johnny Cash, Laura Kariuki as Mavis Staples and more.\n\n\"You're trying to find something that feels like [Dylan], but also feels like Timmy, meaning that if I were trying to describe the directorial goal, you want your actor to play the part, of course, but you don't want them to lose what's special about themselves. Almost what you want is for the actor to find the parallel aspects in them and the person they're playing. And to get those in harmony and then apply the outward affectations that do not disturb that initial kind of groove that they found with the character from their gut, if that makes sense,\" Mangold offered in a new interview with Rolling Stone when asked about the delineation between replicating a person and leaving room for a character to unfold.\n\nWhen asked about Chalmet's vocal chops on the assignment, the director added, \"I think what's so wonderful about what Timmy is doing is that, while not answering questions about Bob, at the same time I think he does in a very poetic way, which is to suggest really empathically through his performance how one might want to make music, but one might not want to have people in your face all the time.\"\n\n\"And I think in a way, Bob answers that... Timmy, who I'm used to calling Bob sometimes, answers that question. I think he walks a really beautiful line of allowing an audience to see what a joy it is for this character to make music and what pure joy he experiences in his camaraderie with other musicians and his exploration of ideas and words and music, both making it and listening to others.

The actor transforms into Bob Dylan for James Mangold's upcoming biopic A Complete Unknown, which explores the folk icon's rise and controversial shift to electric guitar.\n\n\"A few weeks back, my friend Woody Guthrie and I, we met a young man; he dropped in on us out of nowhere and he played us a song,\" Pete Seeger (Edward Norton) introduces Dylan onstage. \"In that moment, we got a feeling we were getting a glimpse of the future.\"\n\nThe new trailer doesn't overload viewers with plot details. Instead, it showcases Chalamet's Dylan-esque vocals through a rendition of \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\" performed for an unseen, captivated audience. Chalamet captures Dylan's distinctive raspy tone convincingly, likely thrilling his devoted online fanbase.\n\nAs the song plays, we glimpse girlfriend Sylvie Russo (Elle Fanning), who catches Dylan's eye at a folk gathering and rides pillion on his motorcycle. Early supporter and fellow musician Joan Baez (Monica Barbaro) also saw a chance for romance with Dylan and seized it.\n\nLast update on 2024-07-24 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API", "source": {"uri": "socialitelife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Socialite Life"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoth\u00e9e_Chalamet", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Guthrie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Woody Guthrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Rain's_a-Gonna_Fall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Seeger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward Norton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Product_Advertising_API", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Product Advertising API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Barbaro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monica Barbaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elle Fanning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affiliate_marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affiliate marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joan Baez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motorcycle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://socialitelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/timothee-chalamet-bob-dylan-07242024.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759626", "eventUri": "eng-9759626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

The film, directed by James Mangold stars the incredible, Oscar-nominated Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Bob Dylan.\n\nThis is pretty cool because in case you missed it, the movie filmed in New Jersey locations, including in Passaic, Hudson, Essex and Cape May Counties this past spring and early summer! Chalamet himself was seen on several occasions in full Bob Dylan costume.\n\nFor instance, you may remember when Chalamet and Elle Fanning (who stars as love interest Sylvie Russo) were seen filming together in Paterson.\n\nAnd again \"riding\" a motorbike in Cape May in May! They look so effortlessly cool.\n\nThe filmmakers also recruited Cape May locals as extras to film a big music festival scene.

Parts of the movie were filmed this spring in Cape May. Below is our original story about the filming.\n\nCAPE MAY -- At Bob Dylan's third appearance at the Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island in 1965, rather than his familiar acoustic guitar, he came on stage slinging a Fender Stratocaster backed by a full band.\n\nIt's difficult to imagine now, but the electric set at a folk music event proved deeply divisive at the time and in the years to come. It has often been described as a seminal moment in American music in the 20th century. Dylan was 24 at the time.\n\nFilming is underway on \"A Complete Unknown,\" with director James Mangold seeking to capture that moment almost 60 years later, Timothe\u00e9 Chalamet playing Dylan and Cape May standing in for Newport.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Crowds have arrived with hopes of catching a glimpse of the A-list actors and the painstaking process of creating a film.\n\nMayor Zack Mullock said many young people want a chance to see Chalamet, who has risen to certifiable stardom in the two-part sci-fi epic \"Dune,\" the prequel \"Wonka,\" the Academy Award-nominated \"Call Me By Your Name\" and other projects, and Elle Fanning, playing Dylan's then-girlfriend Sylvie Russo, likely a fictionalized version of the late Suze Rotolo, the woman holding tight to Dylan's arm on the album cover of \"The Freewheeling Bob Dylan.\"\n\nThe film also stars Monica Barbaro as Joan Baez, Edward Norton as Pete Seeger, who famously reacted strongly to Dylan's electric set backstage, Scoot McNairy as Woody Guthrie and Boyd Holbrook as Johnny Cash.\n\nCape May to divert traffic for filming of Bob Dylan movie starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\n\nThe city will have a variety of traffic changes starting this weekend due to the filming of a Bob Dylan movie.\n\nMullock said he has not asked to meet any of the actors, saying he would not want to be an unneeded distraction. He has been interested in the artistry that goes in to making a modern town look like it could be 1965, and the care to avoid anachronisms.\n\nHe also loves the cars.\n\nThere are about 60 to 75 vintage cars around town, parked or driving by to add detail in scene backgrounds.\n\n\"They are not creampuffs. They're normal cars of the era that are not in perfect condition,\" Mullock said. \"We've all been to car shows where you see these perfectly manicured classic cars.\"\n\nThere was no luck contacting the projection company; The Picture Company does not publish contact information. A city spokesperson contacted Tuesday said the company had asked to tamp down on coverage until local filming wraps, which is expected by Friday. There was no response to emails to a provided address.\n\nMullock said that was likely to avoid significant and growing crowds. But with coverage from Philadelphia media and multiple posts on Facebook and elsewhere, not to mention a city news release warning of detours, it seems like the cat is unequivocally out of the bag.\n\nThe production has meant a significant boost to local businesses, Mullock said, adding that the week after Mother's Day is usually pretty quiet in Cape May.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nLambert said his business is way up compared to the same time last year, and even before production began, advanced scouts for the production came into the coffee shop as they toured the town.\n\nCape May County wants parkway rest stop named for Civil War veteran, not Bruce Willis\n\nThe Cape May County governing body approved a resolution suggesting the Ocean View Garden State Parkway rest stop be named after a local veteran or community leader rather than actor Bruce Willis.\n\n\"It's nice to know they support local businesses,\" he said.\n\nThe production has closed some roads, but Lambert said no one seems to mind the inconvenience, joking that after the extensive roadwork undertaken over the winter, Cape May is more or less immune to detours.\n\nThe paving and sewer work on Lafayette Street is also set to wrap up this week, Mullock said, and the road will be reopened when paving is complete. He said this is a good time for filming, because in a few months the city will be far too busy.\n\n\"We could never have done it in the summer. We couldn't give up that many parking spaces,\" he said.\n\nMaybe he is a little biased because of the local connection, but Mullock believes the film could be in the running for Best Picture after it is released. He cited director Mangold's track record, which includes \"Ford v Ferrari,\" \"Walk the Line,\" \"Girl, Interrupted\" and \"The Wolverine.\"\n\nMullock said the production company reached out to him while scouting locations.\n\n\"They were really impressed when we took them around town. They were just kind of blown away,\" Mullock said. The city could stand as a location for multiple eras, from the Victorian to the present, he said the advance team told him.\n\n\"They said, 'We don't think this is the last film you guys get.' They may have been just buttering me up,\" Mullock said.\n\nCape parkway rest stop to be renamed for Bruce Willis\n\nThe Ocean View service plaza on the Garden State Parkway will honor actor Bruce Willis, who grew up in Salem County and is known for his starring role in the \"Die Hard\" movie franchise.\n\nIt is unusual for Cape May to see a major motion picture filmed there, but not without precedent. In 1971, residents gathered to catch a glimpse of Robert Mitchum, Brenda Vaccaro and Jan-Michael Vincent filming \"Going Home\" in the town and in Wildwood.\n\nThe film industry website IMDb shows 32 films with Cape May as a filming location, from low-budget horror flicks to nature documentaries to the Civil Rights-era drama \"Nothing But a Man,\" released a year before the events of \"A Complete Unknown\" took place.\n\nFilming for the Dylan movie already took place in Hoboken, Hudson County, earlier this year. Earlier coverage of the film indicated Dylan has met with Mangold and given notes on the script, which also covers his arrival in the Greenwich Village folk scene from Hibbing, Minnesota, in the early 1960s, when he was first described as the voice of a generation.\n\nBeginning his career immersed in traditional folk styles, Dylan's electric set was just the first of multiple shifts in a six-decade career, which also includes some shifts back.\n\nHe has released country and rock albums, answered the lush arrangements of \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" with the stripped-down acoustic songs of \"John Wesley Harding,\" spent years as a born-again Christian, released a growly Christmas album and interpreted the Great American Songbook of Frank Sinatra before returning to and reinterpreting his own songbook in last year's \"Shadow Kingdom.\"\n\nHe has been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Nobel Prize for literature, along with multiple other recognitions in and out of the music industry, and continues to tour relentlessly, set to appear with Willie Nelson, Mavis Staples and Robert Plant and Alison Krause in Camden on July 4.\n\nMullock described himself as a fan.\n\n\"Growing up, his music was always on in the background,\" he said.\n\nContact Bill Barlow:\n\n609-272-7290\n\nbbarlow@pressofac.com\n\nTwitter @jerseynews_bill\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

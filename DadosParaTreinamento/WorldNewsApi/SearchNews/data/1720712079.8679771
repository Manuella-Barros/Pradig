The 64-year-old TV presenter has swapped being TV's top petrolhead for a love of farming, with Clarkson's Farm proving to be a huge hit on Amazon Prime, but it is his work ethic that has made him not such a perfect partner in love. Lisa has been with Jeremy since 2017 and she has said that sometimes the relationship is \"difficult\" but also she has hailed the \"extraordinary\" amount he can get done in a day. Speaking about their relationship, Lisa said: \"He\u2019s a workaholic, and that can be difficult sometimes. I think I work quite hard, but I\u2019m like a sloth in comparison to him. He is extraordinary with the amount he can power through in one day.\" Lisa continued: \u201cHe was doing The Grand Tour, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and writing three columns a week, sometimes four. He has an extraordinary ability to get stuff done, so I\u2019ve had to raise my game a lot living with him. I would like to be a lot lazier, if I\u2019m being honest.\u201d Lisa joked that there was a big reason that drives Jeremy to work so hard. She said: \"Not wanting to go back and live in the North of England. He\u2019s just one of those characters, but I think he wants to maintain his life.\u201d After seven years together, fans of Jeremy asked whether he would propose to Lisa, after she admitted that the TV star could get down on one knee. Speaking about the comment, that she made on Clarkson's Farm after celebrating her 51st birthday, Lisa admitted: \"I was the one who made the joke \u2014 and I like a good wind-up with Jeremy, so it\u2019s all teasing and it\u2019s all in good spirit and I really don\u2019t mind any of that. I would be first to be the wind-up merchant.\u201d Recently the former Top Gear presenter abruptly replied to his Clarkson's Farm co-star Kaleb Cooper on Instagram after he made a joke about Lisa. After Jeremy had wished his partner happy birthday on Instagram. \"Now the question is did Lisa like my singing this morning happy birthday,\" Kaleb wrote under the upload, making sure to add the laughing face emoji. Jeremy seemingly didn't see the funny side, simply replying \"No\", as Lisa jumped in to make her comment. She said that she \"adored all perfectly sung first five words\", adding: \"I really did, t'was perfection.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "summary": "Jeremy Clarkson's partner Lisa Hogan has revealed the one thing that makes the former Top Gear host hard to live with", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/jeremy-clarksons-partner-confesses-its-32991923", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32991876.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JEREMY-MAIN.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:02:34", "author": "James Brinsford,James.brinsford", "authors": ["James Brinsford", "James.brinsford"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.258}

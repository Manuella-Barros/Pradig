Officials have opened an investigation into the spill.\n\n\"There will be severe consequences to those responsible for this incident, and we will prosecute them,\" Sheikh Abdullah al-Sabah, a member of the ruling family who is head of the Environment Public Authority, told The Associated Press.\n\nHe urged residents to keep away from affected areas, which lie north of a private beach and resort area called al-Khiran where many Kuwaitis spend most of the summer in beach houses.\n\nBoats and crews have been putting booms into the water to try and contain the spill. Officials want to protect waterways, power plants and water facilities first, then clean surrounding beaches, according to a report on the state-run KUNA news agency.\n\nKhaled al-Hajeri, the president of Kuwait's Green Line Society, said the environmental non-profit organization holds the government responsible for any damage or health effects of the spill.\n\n\"The government failed to issue a statement communicating the severity of this disaster. There was no warning people against fishing or entering the polluted area, even though it is close to some of the most popular summer destinations in Kuwait,\" he told the AP. \"This is what happens when under-qualified individuals handle the government's most sensitive environment entity.\"\n\nAl-Hajeri said the spill began days ago and that activists from his group informed authorities about it on August 10.\n\n\"This media blackout is intentional, and wrong. People have the right to know. This will have an impact on the fish, the food people consume, and it directly affects their health and safety,\" he added.\n\nAuthorities in neighboring Saudi Arabia have put an emergency action plan into effect to deal with the spill and were conducting an aerial survey of the area, according to a statement carried by Saudi Press Agency.\n\nThe joint operations center in the Saudi border town of Khafji said facilities there have not been affected by the spill.\n\nKuwait said American oil firm Chevron Corp. and containment specialists Oil Spill Response Limited were helping in the cleanup.

They offered no estimate for the number of barrels of oil spilled, though footage from Kuwait's Environment Public Authority showed oil tarring the beaches and in the waters off the southern area of Ras al-Zour.\n\nBoats and crews have been putting booms into the water to try and contain the spill. Officials want to protect waterways, power plants and water facilities first, then clean surrounding beaches, according to a report on the state-run KUNA news agency.\n\nAuthorities in neighboring Saudi Arabia have put an emergency action plan into effect to deal with the spill and were conducting an aerial survey of the area, according to a statement carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency.\n\nThe joint operations center in the Saudi border town of Khafji said facilities there have not been affected by the spill.\n\nKuwait said American oil firm Chevron Corp. and containment specialists Oil Spill Response Limited were helping in the cleanup. Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, operates fields on both sides of the border. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe area in Kuwait is home to the oil and natural gas fields shared by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

including a 6,15,000-barrel-per-day refinery is being built.\n\nThere were no official reports about the source or size of the spill in the waters near the Al-Khafji field.\n\nHowever, Kuwaiti media today quoted local oil experts as saying the spill originated from an old 50-kilometre pipeline from Al-Khafji.\n\nThe experts estimated that as many as 35,000 barrels of crude may have leaked into the waters off Al-Zour.\n\nEmergency teams have sealed off two power and water desalination plants in the area to prevent contamination.\n\nKuwait depends largely on desalination for its fresh water supplies.\n\nSaudi Arabia and Bahrain, located south of Kuwait along the Gulf coast, said slicks from the spill had not reached their waters.\n\nSaudi Arabia, in a statement published by the official

Officials have opened an investigation into the spill.\n\n\"There will be severe consequences to those responsible for this incident, and we will prosecute them,\" Sheikh Abdullah al-Sabah, a member of the ruling family who is head of the Environment Public Authority, told The Associated Press.\n\nHe urged residents to keep away from affected areas, which lie north of a private beach and resort area called al-Khiran where many Kuwaitis spend most of the summer in beach houses.\n\nBoats and crews have been putting booms into the water to try and contain the spill. Officials want to protect waterways, power plants and water facilities first, then clean surrounding beaches, according to a report on the state-run KUNA news agency.\n\nKhaled al-Hajeri, the president of Kuwait's Green Line Society, said the environmental non-profit organization holds the government responsible for any damage or health effects of the spill.\n\n\"The government failed to issue a statement communicating the severity of this disaster. There was no warning people against fishing or entering the polluted area, even though it is close to some of the most popular summer destinations in Kuwait,\" he told the AP. \"This is what happens when under-qualified individuals handle the government's most sensitive environment entity.\"\n\nAl-Hajeri said the spill began days ago and that activists from his group informed authorities about it on August 10.\n\n\"This media blackout is intentional, and wrong. People have the right to know. This will have an impact on the fish, the food people consume, and it directly affects their health and safety,\" he added.\n\nAuthorities in neighboring Saudi Arabia have put an emergency action plan into effect to deal with the spill and were conducting an aerial survey of the area, according to a statement carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency.\n\nThe joint operations center in the Saudi border town of Khafji said facilities there have not been affected by the spill.\n\nKuwait said American oil firm Chevron Corp. and containment specialists Oil Spill Response Limited were helping in the cleanup.

35,000 barrels of crude may have leaked into the waters off Al-Zour.\n\nEmergency teams have sealed off two power and water desalination plants in the area to prevent contamination.\n\nKuwait depends

oil spill near the joint Kuwaiti-Saudi Al-Khafji oilfield in the Gulf, an official said today.\n\n\"The major portion of the main oil spill has been removed,\" Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) spokesman Sheikh Talal al-Khaled Al-Sabah said in a statement.\n\nTeams were still working to clean other parts of the spill and coastal areas, he said.\n\nEmergency teams have been battling the large oil spill since it appeared off the emirate's southern coast on Thursday.\n\nSheikh Talal said precautionary measures have been taken around vital installations in Al-Zour area where a huge USD 30-billion oil complex including a 6,15,000-barrel-per-day refinery is being built.\n\nThere were no official reports about the source or size of the spill in the waters near the Al-Khafji field.\n\nHowever, Kuwaiti media today quoted local oil experts as saying the spill originated from an old 50-kilometre pipeline from Al-Khafji.\n\nThe experts estimated that as many as 35,000 barrels of crude may have leaked into the waters off Al-Zour.\n\nEmergency teams have sealed off two power and water desalination plants in the area to prevent contamination.\n\nKuwait depends largely on desalination for its fresh water supplies.\n\nSaudi Arabia and Bahrain, located south of Kuwait along the Gulf coast, said slicks from the spill had not reached their waters.\n\nSaudi Arabia, in a statement published by the official SPA news agency, said it had implemented a \"crisis management plan\" and was conducting an aerial survey of its oil installations along the coast.\n\nThe KPC said teams from Saudi Arabian Chevron and Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL) had joined the coastal clean-up.\n\nOPEC member Kuwait pumps around 2.7 million barrels per day of crude oil, providing around 85

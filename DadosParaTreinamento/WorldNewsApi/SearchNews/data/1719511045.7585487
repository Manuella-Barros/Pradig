The talented and versatile Cleveland vocalist, who works in a range of genres, including R&B, jazz, gospel and opera, is scheduled to perform at 7 p.m. June 7 on the front steps of Lakewood Public Library (15425 Detroit Ave.).. He\u2019s also is an accomplished jazz pianist, percussionist, music director/arranger, vocal coach and minister of music. The remaining schedule includes Friday performances through July 12 followed by concerts at the Madison Park pavilion (13201 Madison Ave.) on July 19 and 26. Lego fun: North Olmsted City Schools recently bridged the generation gap with area seniors using Legos. Sixth-graders from North Olmsted Middle School teacher Gina Opdycke\u2019s class were joined by Coordinator of Instructional Technology Leah Blaze for a visit to the North Olmsted Senior Center. The idea was to build and program Lego projects with members of the community. Together they built and programmed a dancing robot or a hand that could pick up items. The students did a great job explaining the project and the seniors had a blast seeing their projects come to life. No word if the seniors had any flashbacks of painfully stepping barefooted on Legos. Battle of the Books: A Harrison Elementary School fifth-grade Battle of the Books team won the districtwide competition in a thrilling final round versus Hayes Elementary School. The competition, a Jeopardy-style question-and-answer game, was the culmination of the team members reading four books over the last four months and answering questions on content. The teachers commented it was great to see so many students excited about reading and learning to love literature. Lakewood senior services: On May 15, the Department of Human Services and Lakewood Ohio Division of Aging, alongside neighborhood paramedics and police officers and LakewoodAlive, met with senior residents at Lake Shore Towers to share valuable information and resources. Sponsored by the Healthy Lakewood Foundation, the initiative aims to inform seniors in apartment buildings about available services. Senior residents living in multi-unit dwellings who are interested in scheduling a visit can contact the Department of Human Services at 216-529-6687 to arrange a meeting.

Mike Parson (R) signed a bill Thursday that kicks Planned Parenthood in the state off Medicaid funding.\n\nThe bill, which is expected to go into effect later this year, makes it unlawful for any public funds to be sent to any abortion facility or \"any affiliate or associate of such abortion facility.\"\n\nMissouri now joins Arkansas, Mississippi and Texas, according to Planned Parenthood, as states that have blocked the organization from receiving Medicaid funding.\n\nRepublicans in Missouri have tried for years to block Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood, even after the organization stopped performing abortions in the state.\n\nSince the 2022 reversal of Roe v. Wade, abortion has been almost completely banned in Missouri with limited exceptions under a so-called trigger law that took effect shortly after the Supreme Court decision.\n\nPlanned Parenthood clinics in the state have continued to operate, providing patients with services like contraceptive care, STI testing, cancer screenings and wellness checks, the Missouri Independent reported.\n\nMissouri Planned Parenthood locations are affiliated with clinics in Kansas and Illinois, neighboring states with less restrictive abortion laws. Republicans argue no money should go to Planned Parenthood in Missouri because people at the Missouri locations could advise people to travel to other states to get abortion services.\n\n\"Our administration has been the strongest pro-life administration in Missouri history,\" Parson said in a statement. \"We've ended all abortions in this state, approved new support for mothers, expecting mothers, and children, and with this bill, ensured that we are not sending taxpayer dollars to abortion providers for any purpose.\"\n\nDemocrats and abortion advocates have argued that the bill will target the state's most vulnerable population, and those who used Planned Parenthood for services other than abortion.\n\nThe St. Louis and Southwest Missouri chapter of Planned Parenthood said the bill would restrict access to non-abortion related care to low-income people in the state.\n\n\"Just like [Missouri's] abortion ban, 'defunding' is about power & control; it's part of the fight to make sure Missourians -- not politicians -- control their bodies, lives, & futures!\" the chapter posted online.\n\nThe chapter said its clinics remain open at this time. Planned Parenthood Great Plains CEO and President Emily Wales told the Missouri Independent that Missouri's clinics have been without Medicaid reimbursements for two years and have offset the costs through private fundraising.\n\nPlanned Parenthood Great Plains covers Missouri, Oklahoma and Kansas.\n\nNearly one in five of Planned Parenthood's Missouri patients are on Medicaid, the outlet reported.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_irwin@thehill.com", "name": "Lauren Irwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medicaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Planned Parenthood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Parson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Parson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trigger law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

In Missouri, the law would apply to Planned Parenthood.\n\n\"This is something Republicans have been working for years, since we captured the majority,\" said state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, an Arnold Republican who sponsored a version of the legislation.\n\nShe added: \"It's a huge victory. Missouri has a long history of being a pro-life state.\"\n\nNearly every abortion, with exceptions for medical emergencies, has been illegal in Missouri since 2022. However, the state's Planned Parenthood clinics have continued to operate, providing services such as contraceptive care, STI testing, cancer screenings and wellness checks.\n\nMissouri Republicans have argued that no additional money should be going to Planned Parenthood, since Missouri's locations are affiliated with clinics in Kansas and Illinois, where abortion is legal and where many Missourians travel for the procedure.\n\nDemocrats, Planned Parenthood and other health institutes have argued the bill would cause the most harm to Missouri's most vulnerable population, who may be forced to find a new provider. But the state's public health safety net is already strained and will have a difficult time absorbing the thousands of displaced patients.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Missouri House approved the legislation, originally filed by Republican state Rep. Cody Smith of Carthage, though it did so without approving an emergency clause which would have put the bill into effect immediately upon the governor's signing.\n\nColeman's version of the bill was blocked by a Democratic filibuster in February. A second filibuster by Senate Democrats in April was abandoned after 11 hours when Republicans agreed to remove a provision that would have ended contracts with organizations founded by eugenicists.\n\nMissouri Republicans have twice before tried to pass a similar restriction through the state budget, attempts that were ruled unconstitutional by state courts.\n\nA similar restriction went into effect in Arkansas several years ago when the law was upheld by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis. At that time, Planned Parenthood clinics in Arkansas immediately stopped seeing Medicaid patients.\n\nAfter the bill cleared the legislature, Planned Parenthood Great Plains and Planned Parenthood of St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, which have clinics in Missouri, said in a statement that they will continue trying to serve all patients, \"no matter what.\"\n\nAs of March, Planned Parenthood clinics in Missouri had been without Medicaid reimbursements for two years. At the time, Emily Wales, CEO and president of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said her organization offset the cost of care for Missouri Medicaid patients through private fundraising.\n\nMO HealthNet, the state's Medicaid program, serves low-income and disabled citizens and has long banned funding for abortion, with limited exceptions.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has said nearly one in five of their Missouri patients are on Medicaid.\n\nThe Missouri Family Health Council Inc. has been particularly vocal against the bill, saying it could harm thousands of patients.\n\nThe health care nonprofit found through informal surveying that across Missouri's safety net clinics, wait times over the past two years averaged between five and seven weeks, with some clinics as few as two weeks and some pausing new patients completely. Meanwhile, wait times at the state's Planned Parenthood clinics averaged between the same day and three days to get an appointment.\n\nIn 2022, across all 68 safety net clinics in the state that take Title X funding, around 24 percent of the clients were on Medicaid, said Michelle Trupiano, the council's executive director.\n\nThe Missouri Independent, www.missouriindependent.com, is a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization covering state government and its impact on Missourians.

Mike Parson signed legislation Thursday blocking state and federal funds from going to the organization.\n\nThe new law, which goes into effect Aug. 28, is the third -- and Republicans hope final -- attempt to end Medicaid reimbursements to any health centers affiliated with abortion providers.\n\nDespite this, Planned Parenthood announced Thursday its clinics will remain \"open to all.\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood clinics in Missouri no longer perform abortions; their affiliates in Illinois and Kansas do. In Missouri, clinics continue to provide services such as contraceptive care, STI testing, cancer screenings and wellness checks.\n\n\"Experts have been clear there are not enough providers in the system to absorb the thousands of patients that Planned Parenthood health centers serve,\" Planned Parenthood Great Plains and Planned Parenthood St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri said in a joint statement Thursday.\n\nParson was flanked by state Rep. Cody Smith, R-Carthage, and state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, R-Arnold, as he signed the legislation Thursday morning.\n\n\"We've ended all elective abortions in this state, approved new support for mothers, expecting mothers and children and, with this bill, ensured that we are not sending taxpayer dollars to abortion providers for any purpose,\" Parson said in a statement.\n\nNearly one in five Planned Parenthood patients in Missouri are insured through MO HealthNet, the state's Medicaid program that serves low-income and disabled citizens and has long banned funding for abortion.\n\nPlanned Parenthood also sees more than half of Missouri's low-income patients seeking family planning services, according to the Missouri Family Health Council Inc.\n\nDemocrats argued the legislation would primarily harm low-income Missourians who could be forced to find a new provider through the state's already strained public health safety net if Planned Parenthood cannot foot the bill for these patients long-term. This could delay critical and potentially life-saving care.\n\nIn Missouri, women on Medicaid are 10 times more likely to die within one year of pregnancy than those on private insurance, according to an August multi-year report on maternal mortality published by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.\n\nMissouri is also fighting rising congenital syphilis rates. In the majority of these cases, pregnant mothers had little to no prenatal care, highlighting a larger issue of maternal health care access, the health department noted.\n\nThrough an informal survey, the Missouri Family Health Council Inc. found that over the past two years, the wait list for new patients at public health safety net clinics can be weeks or months, and that's if the provider is taking new patients at all. Meanwhile, wait times at the state's Planned Parenthood clinics averaged between the same day and three days to get an appointment.\n\n\"Other providers cannot absorb the thousands of patients impacted by this 'defunding' attack,\" Planned Parenthood said in a statement. \"For this reason, Planned Parenthood health centers have worked to keep serving MO HealthNet patients at no cost though it is an unsustainable model for a state's health care system.\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood clinics in Missouri have been without Medicaid reimbursements for more than two years as prior attempts by Republicans to pass similar restrictions through the state budget were litigated and later struck down in court.\n\nEmily Wales, CEO and president of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said her organization offset the cost of care for Missouri Medicaid patients during this time through private fundraising.\n\nBoth Planned Parenthood affiliates in Missouri have said they plan to continue seeing patients on Medicaid \"no matter what.\" They have not elaborated on how they plan to afford to do so.\n\nPlanned Parenthood on Thursday continues to argue that the latest law is unconstitutional, and is in violation of federal Medicaid law, which states patients have a right to choose their provider.\n\nA similar law that went into effect in Arkansas several years ago was ultimately upheld by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis. Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which oversees that state's clinics, stopped seeing Arkansas Medicaid patients immediately.\n\nParson signed the bill near the end of the 15 days he had to do so despite a group of Republican lawmakers attempting to strong-arm him into doing so sooner.\n\nLast month, Senate members of the Missouri Freedom Caucus promised to filibuster the renewal of Medicaid taxes, known as the federal reimbursement allowance, until Parson signed the defund Planned Parenthood bill and until the General Assembly approved a proposed constitutional amendment that would make it more difficult to pass constitutional amendments proposed by voter-led initiatives.\n\nThe initiative petition bill and the FRA require a final vote in the Senate before the legislative session ends at 6 p.m. on May 17.\n\nThis was first published by the Missouri Independent, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization covering state government, politics and policy, and is reprinted with

Planned Parenthood, Democratic lawmakers and health organizations say the ban will cause the most harm to low-income Missourians who rely on the clinics for contraceptives, STI testing, cancer screenings and more.\n\nMissouri Gov. Mike Parson has announced he will sign legislation limiting Planned Parenthood's ability to serve low-income patients at a ceremony in his Capitol office Thursday.\n\nThe new law, which will go into effect Aug. 28, will end Medicaid reimbursements to any health centers affiliated with abortion providers. In Missouri, the law would apply to Planned Parenthood.\n\n\"This is something Republicans have been working for years, since we captured the majority,\" said state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, an Arnold Republican who sponsored a version of the legislation. She added: \"It's a huge victory. Missouri has a long history of being a pro-life state.\"\n\nNearly every abortion, with exceptions for medical emergencies, has been illegal in Missouri since 2022. However, the state's Planned Parenthood clinics have continued to operate, providing services such as contraceptive care, STI testing, cancer screenings and wellness checks.\n\nMissouri Republicans have argued that no additional money should be going to Planned Parenthood, since Missouri's locations are affiliated with clinics in Kansas and Illinois, where abortion is legal and where many Missourians travel for the procedure.\n\nDemocrats, Planned Parenthood and other health institutes have argued that the bill would cause the most harm to Missouri's most vulnerable population, who may be forced to find a new provider. But the state's public health safety net is already strained and will have a difficult time absorbing the thousands of displaced patients.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Missouri House approvedthe legislation, originally filed by Republican state Rep, Cody Smith of Carthage, though it did so without approving an emergency clause which would have put the bill into effect immediately upon the governor's signing.\n\nColeman's version of the bill was blocked by a Democratic filibuster in February. A second filibuster by Senate Democrats in April was abandoned after 11 hours when Republicans agreed to remove a provision that would have ended contracts with organizations founded by eugenicists.\n\nMissouri Republicans have twice before tried to pass a similar restriction through the state budget, attempts that were ruled unconstitutional by state courts.\n\nA similar restriction went into effect in Arkansas several years ago when the law was upheld by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis. At that time, Planned Parenthood clinics in Arkansas immediately stopped seeing Medicaid patients.\n\nAfter the bill cleared the legislature, Planned Parenthood Great Plains and Planned Parenthood of St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, which have clinics in Missouri, said in a statement that they will continue trying to serve all patients, \"no matter what.\"\n\nAs of March, Planned Parenthood clinics in Missouri had been without Medicaid reimbursements for two years. At the time, Emily Wales, CEO and president of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said her organization offset the cost of care for Missouri Medicaid patients through private fundraising.\n\nMO HealthNet, the state's Medicaid program, serves low-income and disabled citizens and has long banned funding for abortion, with limited exceptions.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has said nearly one in five of their Missouri patients are on Medicaid.\n\nThe Missouri Family Health Council Inc. has been particularly vocal against the bill, saying it could harm thousands of patients.\n\nThe health care nonprofit found through informal surveying that across Missouri's safety net clinics, wait times over the past two years averaged between five and seven weeks, with some clinics as few as two weeks and some pausing new patients completely. Meanwhile, wait times at the state's Planned Parenthood clinics averaged between the same day and three days to get an appointment.\n\nIn 2022, across all 68 safety net clinics in the state that take Title X funding, around 24% of the clients were on Medicaid, said Michelle Trupiano, the council's executive director.", "source": {"uri": "kcur.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KCUR 89.3 - NPR in Kansas City.

Parson Signs Bill to Kick Planned Parenthood off Medicaid", "body": "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Missouri's Republican Gov. Mike Parson on Thursday signed legislation to once again try to kick Planned Parenthood out of the state's Medicaid program.\n\nParson's signature could mean Missouri joins a small band of states -- Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas, according to Planned Parenthood -- to have successfully blocked Medicaid funding for the organization.\n\n\"Our administration has been the strongest pro-life administration in Missouri history,\" Parson said. \"We've ended all elective abortions in this state, approved new support for mothers, expecting mothers, and children, and, with this bill, ensured that we are not sending taxpayer dollars to abortion providers for any purpose.\"\n\nIn Missouri, Republicans have tried for years to block Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood clinics because of its association with abortion. That has continued even though Planned Parenthood no longer performs abortions in Missouri.\n\nA state law prohibiting most abortions took effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a nationwide right to abortion in June 2022.\n\nDefunding efforts in the state have been repeatedly thwarted in the courts. A February Missouri Supreme Court ruling found that lawmakers' latest attempt at defunding Planned Parenthood was unconstitutional.\n\n\"This bill not only defies the ruling of Missouri's highest court but also flouts federal Medicaid law,\" the region's Planned Parenthood center said in a statement. \"By denying Medicaid patients' right to receive health care from Planned Parenthood, politicians are directly obstructing access to much-needed health services, including birth control, cancer screenings, annual wellness exams, and STI testing and treatment.\"\n\nMissouri Planned Parenthood plans to continue treating Medicaid patients at no cost, according to the organization.\n\nMeanwhile, abortion-rights advocates last week turned in more than twice the needed number of signatures to put a proposal to legalize abortion on the Missouri ballot this year.\n\nRepublican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft's office still needs to verify the signatures. But supporters have said they are confident they will qualify for the ballot.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

April 30, 2024.\n\nEditorial: Missouri Republicans already banned abortion. Now they're targeting Planned Parenthood\n\nMissouri Republicans are trying to ban abortion twice over.\n\nSound silly? It kind of is. Abortion has been illegal in the state ever since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, of course. If women want or need to terminate a pregnancy, they're either out of luck or have to head out of state, perhaps next door to Kansas where the procedure remains legal if increasingly regulated.\n\nFor now, though, you can't get a legal abortion in the Show-Me State, except in emergencies.\n\nBut that's not quite enough for Republicans in Jefferson City. They voted last week to block Medicaid dollars from going to Planned Parenthood and its health care clinics across the state.\n\nWentzville superintendent's departure came after threats and police patrols Busch Stadium needs renovations.

'It's my university's turn.'\n\nWhy? Abortion of course.\n\n\"This is not health care,\" said state Rep. Mazzie Christensen of Bethany. \"These facilities should not be in our state and I'm sick and tired of hearing about it.\"\n\nExcept, of course, health care is exactly what Planned Parenthood provides in Missouri. The organization didn't go away just because abortion was banned. It still does breast and cervical cancer screenings, prenatal and postpartum care, along with tests for sexually transmitted diseases. And it even dispenses birth control.\n\nPretty important stuff, if you need it.\n\nBut no abortions. They're illegal except when there is a \"medical emergency\" -- a distinction that health care professionals are not using as a loophole. Only 52 of these cases occurred in the state from June 2022 through 2023, and none of the procedures were performed at Missouri Planned Parenthood clinics, according to the nonprofit Missouri Independent. Which means Missouri Republicans are trying to cut off funds to an organization that can't actually do what it's being defunded for.\n\nAssuming that Gov. Mike Parson signs off on the bill, that means Missouri will be the rare state that has -- in essence -- banned abortions twice. It's a pretty nifty trick, if you think about it. And maybe a pretty great thing, perhaps, if you're anti-abortion rights.\n\nIf you're a woman who just wants to get a cancer screening in places like Joplin or Rolla, though, life is going to get a bit more difficult.\n\nATTEMPTS TO THWART REFERENDUM PETITION\n\nA different reading of the defunding effort, though, is that Missouri Republicans want to make sure that abortion stays banned once.\n\nPro-choice activists, after all, are working to get signatures for their petition to put the issue on the ballot for a statewide referendum. Since Roe fell, similar statewide votes around the country -- even in deep-red states -- have consistently favored those who want to preserve or restore abortion access.\n\nMissouri would probably get the same result. Republicans in the General Assembly know this. That's why they've spent the last few months trying to gut the referendum petition process. They don't want Missouri voters -- the folks who ostensibly hold democratic power in the state -- to actually have a say in whether abortion is legal or illegal.\n\nDefunding Planned Parenthood is more of the same. Even if Missouri voters do restore abortion's legality, Republicans will have taken a step to ensure abortion access remains constrained. The new measure is simply a way of heading the voters off at the pass.\n\n\"Missouri,\" said state Rep. Brian Seitz of Branson, \"will continue to be a pro-life state.\"\n\nEven if Missourians choose otherwise. So much for democracy.\n\nOf course, there's a third way of reading the defunding effort -- which is that Missouri Republicans aren't just trying to crack down on abortion in Missouri. They're working to undermine Planned Parenthood nationwide.\n\nThe new bill \"very much does what we initially intended it to do,\" said state Rep. Cody Smith, who sponsored the original legislation, \"which is to defund abortion providers and their affiliates.\"\n\nThe affiliates? In Missouri. The providers? Not in Missouri. Which suggests that Missouri Republicans are eager to cut back on abortion access beyond this state's borders.\n\nThat's not really their job, though, is it?\n\nSo let's sum up: The bill that defunds Planned Parenthood is bad for women's health in Missouri. It's bad for voter power. And it's a sneaky-but-real example of legislative overreach.\n\nBanning abortion once was bad enough. Banning it twice over, it turns out, is even worse.\n\nSt. Louis Post-Dispatch. May 2, 2024.\n\nEditorial: Bailey, Ashcroft and their party can't stop lying about immigration debate\n\n\"Wildly irresponsible.\" That's how Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey last month described Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas' perfectly responsible invitation to legal migrants to his city to help alleviate its labor shortage.\n\nIn a made-for-Fox News stunt last month, Bailey issued a threatening letter to Lucas laced with dubious legal reasoning, partisan disinformation and a whiff of xenophobia. All of which is typical of Missouri's most wildly irresponsible statewide officeholder.\n\nSecretary of State Jay Ashcroft, a candidate for governor, took it a step further recently with a fundraising video in which he declares emphatically that Lucas \"stated that he wanted to make Kansas City a 'sanctuary city'\" -- an outright lie.\n\nNow some legislative Republicans are getting in on the act, too, repeating that false narrative and threatening to strip Kansas City of all state funding. Talk about wildly irresponsible.\n\nIt all started in mid-April, in the context of two real problems: New York and other cities are having trouble absorbing the influx of legal migrants; and the Kansas City region, undergoing a building boom, is struggling with a labor shortage.\n\nIt was within that context that Mayor Lucas tweeted on April 16: \"All are welcome in Kansas City. Proud to work with my fellow mayors (in Denver and New York) ... to ensure decompression of new arriving communities and collaboration among cities, labor, non-profits, and federal officials.\"\n\nHis post linked to a Bloomberg piece about Lucas' invitation, which reports that the mayor \"has a hunch that migrants with work permits (emphasis added) could help alleviate the labor shortage\" in his region.\n\nClear as that is, Lucas clarified it further in a tweet the next day, specifying (again) that he was referring to \"persons who are lawfully present, with lawful work permits, and the lawful ability to come to our community.\"\n\nDoes anything about that sound \"wildly irresponsible\"?\n\nBailey's letter to Lucas a day later -- which the attorney general promptly, dutifully shared with Fox News -- threatens unspecified \"legal action\" over Lucas' comments. It quotes from statutes that make it illegal to transport undocumented migrants into Missouri or to employ them.\n\nThe letter acknowledges Lucas' specification that he was talking about migrants who are \"lawfully present, with lawful work permits.\" But Bailey then dismisses that element as irrelevant because the federal government's \"open border programs are themselves illegal.\"\n\nIn calling for the hiring of migrants with federally approved work permits, Bailey alleges, \"you are actively encouraging Missouri businesses to become entangled in a fundamentally unlawful program.\"\n\n\"Fundamentally unlawful\" as decreed not by Congress or the courts, mind you, but by one unelected official in one Midwestern state.\n\nThat Missouri's official state lawyer would posit such a baseless, head-spinning rejection of the bedrock constitutional principle of federalism is both unsettling and unsurprising. Whether from instinctive demagoguery or plain old incompetence, Bailey has shown repeatedly a willingness to flout whatever legal principles get in the way of his right-wing performance art as he seeks election to the position he was appointed to last year.\n\nBailey has more than earned another entry in our on-going \" Bailey Tally \" of the worst official offenses from Missouri's very worst statewide officeholder. The updated list will be posted in Thursday's opinion section of STLToday.com.\n\nSecretary of State Ashcroft subsequently demonstrated why he may well be a close second to Bailey in terms of official mendacity among Missouri officeholders.\n\nSince starting his gubernatorial campaign, Ashcroft has shown a distressing eagerness to abuse both his office and plain truth in his zeal to prevent a fair statewide vote on abortion rights and other hot-button issues. But the campaign fundraising video Ashcroft released trying to monetize the fake controversy over Lucas' remarks was a startling exercise in deception even by those low standards.\n\n\"... I was so appalled when the mayor of Kansas City suggested -- well, no, he even stated -- that he wanted to make Kansas City a 'sanctuary city,'\" Ashcroft lied, looking directly into the camera.\n\nAgain: Lucas' comments on welcoming migrant workers were specifically, explicitly in reference to legal residents with legal work permits. \"Kansas City is not a sanctuary city,\" Lucas reiterated to reporters after a recent Kansas City Council meeting. \"Kansas City follows the laws of the state of Missouri,\" which already prohibit any city in the state from becoming a sanctuary for undocumented immigrants.\n\nThat existing prohibition hasn't stopped some Republicans in the Legislature from trying to make it an issue anyway, with threats to strip Kansas City of state funding if it becomes a sanctuary city. That whole legislative enterprise is as meaningless as it is pathetic. Because Lucas has explicitly rejected the very premise, they might as well pass a law prohibiting him from harboring vampires.\n\nIt's all part of today's GOP playbook in Missouri: In the absence of any constructive ideas, the party's elected officials invent dragons to slay: Critical race theory! Woke! DEI!\n\nAnd now the deliberate blurring of the line between legal and illegal migration in a calculated scheme to whip up hatred, fear and votes. That's worse than \"wildly irresponsible.\"\n\nEND\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Mike Parson says he will sign into law legislation blocking Medicaid dollars from going to Planned Parenthood, a longtime priority for Republicans even as abortion remains banned in the state.\n\nThe legislation bans any public funds, including Medicaid reimbursements, from going to the organization, abortion facilities, or their affiliates. But it has sparked fears that the measure would hurt those who use Planned Parenthood for a variety of health care services.\n\nParson's office said in a news release on Wednesday that the Republican governor would sign the bill Thursday morning at the state Capitol.\n\nWhile it has been a priority for Republicans, the legislation has also widely been viewed inside the Capitol as a way to appease a hard-right faction of senators called the Missouri Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe group has vowed to block the renewal of a crucial series of taxes that fund Medicaid until Parson signed the bill and until lawmakers pass separate legislation to make it harder for Missourians to amend the state constitution.\n\nInfighting among GOP senators threatens to blow up the General Assembly's final two weeks of session and could force lawmakers into a special session. The Freedom Caucus spent roughly 40 hours halting debate in the chamber last week.\n\nSen. Denny Hoskins, a Warrensburg Republican and member of the Freedom Caucus, said he planned to let the bill re-authorizing the taxes, collectively known as the Federal Reimbursement Allowance or FRA, come up for debate following the governor's commitment to signing the bill to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\n\"As far as me personally, I think that since the governor has publicly said that he's going to sign that, I believe that the FRA will not have much resistance as it goes through the Senate,\" he said.\n\nHoskins also said that he expects the Senate to take up a measure to overhaul the state's initiative petition process either \"immediately before or immediately after\" senators debate the bill to renew the taxes for Medicaid.\n\nThe initiative petition legislation would make it harder for voters to amend the Missouri Constitution in part by weakening the voting power of urban areas.\n\nParson spokesperson Johnathan Shiflett said in an email last week Parson would \"sign the bill on his own timeline according to our office's standard procedures.\"\n\n\"This deliberate dysfunction in the Missouri Senate is unfortunate for the people of Missouri and senators trying to do good work for the people back home in their districts,\" he said.\n\nRepublicans have for years sought to block Planned Parenthood's two affiliates in Missouri from receiving taxpayer dollars through the state's Medicaid program. The Missouri Supreme Court struck down an effort to do it through the state budget in February -- the second time the court did so in four years.\n\nThe GOP-controlled Senate approved the bill on a vote of 23 to 10 last month followed by the House, which voted 106 to 48.\n\nWhile Republicans have framed the legislation as anti-abortion, Missouri already almost entirely bans the procedure under a law that went into effect in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade.\n\nDemocrats have attacked Republicans for pushing the bill, saying that it targets the swath of health care services offered by Planned Parenthood for patients on Medicaid. Those services include cancer screenings, birth control, and testing for sexually transmitted infections or STIs.\n\nRep. LaKeySha Bosley, a St. Louis Democrat, last month pointed to the fact that maternal mortality rates are getting worse in Missouri, particularly for women of color.\n\nA report last year found that Black women in Missouri were three times more likely to die within a year of pregnancy than white women.\n\n\"As a Black woman, I am afraid to have a child in the state of Missouri,\" Bosley said.", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kansas City Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kacen_bayless@kansascity.com", "name": "Kacen Bayless", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "anna_sago@kansascity.com", "name": "Anna Sago", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Parson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Parson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freedom Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medicaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Planned Parenthood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_session", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special session"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_constitution_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State constitution (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrensburg,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warrensburg, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warrensburg, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexually transmitted infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missouri Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Missouri", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of Missouri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Missouri", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Missouri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Mike Parson on Thursday signed legislation to once again try to kick Planned Parenthood out of the state's Medicaid program.\n\nParson's signature could mean Missouri joins a small band of states -- Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas, according to Planned Parenthood -- to have successfully blocked Medicaid funding for the organization.\n\n\"Our administration has been the strongest pro-life administration in Missouri history,\" Parson said. \"We've ended all elective abortions in this state, approved new support for mothers, expecting mothers, and children, and, with this bill, ensured that we are not sending taxpayer dollars to abortion providers for any purpose.\"\n\nIn Missouri, Republicans have tried for years to block Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood clinics because of its association with abortion.

A February Missouri Supreme Court ruling found that lawmakers' latest attempt at defunding Planned Parenthood was unconstitutional.\n\n\"This bill not only defies the ruling of Missouri's highest court but also flouts federal Medicaid law,\" the region's Planned Parenthood center said in a statement. \"By denying Medicaid patients' right to receive health care from Planned Parenthood, politicians are directly obstructing access to much-needed health services, including birth control, cancer screenings, annual wellness exams, and STI testing and treatment.\"\n\nMissouri Planned Parenthood plans to continue treating Medicaid patients at no cost, according to the organization.\n\nMeanwhile, abortion-rights advocates last week turned in more than twice the needed number of signatures to put a proposal to legalize abortion on the Missouri ballot this year.\n\nRepublican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft's office still needs to verify the signatures. But supporters have said they are confident they will qualify for the ballot.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Thomas/Getty Images).\n\nMissouri Gov. Mike Parson has announced he will sign legislation limiting Planned Parenthood's ability to serve low-income patients at a ceremony in his Capitol office Thursday.\n\nThe new law, which will go into effect Aug. 28, will end Medicaid reimbursements to any health centers affiliated with abortion providers. In Missouri, the law would apply to Planned Parenthood.\n\n\"This is something Republicans have been working for years, since we captured the majority,\" said state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, an Arnold Republican who sponsored a version of the legislation. She added: \"It's a huge victory. Missouri has a long history of being a pro-life state.\"\n\nNearly every abortion, with exceptions for medical emergencies, has been illegal in Missouri since 2022. However, the state's Planned Parenthood clinics have continued to operate, providing services such as contraceptive care, STI testing, cancer screenings and wellness checks.\n\nMissouri Republicans have argued that no additional money should be going to Planned Parenthood, since Missouri's locations are affiliated with clinics in Kansas and Illinois, where abortion is legal and where many Missourians travel for the procedure.\n\nDemocrats, Planned Parenthood and other health institutes have argued that the bill would cause the most harm to Missouri's most vulnerable population, who may be forced to find a new provider. But the state's public health safety net is already strained and will have a difficult time absorbing the thousands of displaced patients.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Missouri House approved the legislation, originally filed by Republican state Rep, Cody Smith of Carthage, though it did so without approving an emergency clause which would have put the bill into effect immediately upon the governor's signing.\n\nColeman's version of the bill was blocked by a Democratic filibuster in February. A second filibuster by Senate Democrats in April was abandoned after 11 hours when Republicans agreed to remove a provision that would have ended contracts with organizations founded by eugenicists.\n\nMissouri Republicans have twice before tried to pass a similar restriction through the state budget, attempts that were ruled unconstitutional by state courts.\n\nA similar restriction went into effect in Arkansas several years ago when the law was upheld by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis. At that time, Planned Parenthood clinics in Arkansas immediately stopped seeing Medicaid patients.\n\nAfter the bill cleared the legislature, Planned Parenthood Great Plains and Planned Parenthood of St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, which have clinics in Missouri, said in a statement that they will continue trying to serve all patients, \"no matter what.\"\n\nAs of March, Planned Parenthood clinics in Missouri had been without Medicaid reimbursements for two years. At the time, Emily Wales, CEO and president of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said her organization offset the cost of care for Missouri Medicaid patients through private fundraising.\n\nMO HealthNet, the state's Medicaid program, serves low-income and disabled citizens and has long banned funding for abortion, with limited exceptions.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has said nearly one in five of their Missouri patients are on Medicaid.\n\nThe Missouri Family Health Council Inc. has been particularly vocal against the bill, saying it could harm thousands of patients.\n\nThe health care nonprofit found through informal surveying that across Missouri's safety net clinics, wait times over the past two years averaged between five and seven weeks, with some clinics as few as two weeks and some pausing new patients completely. Meanwhile, wait times at the state's Planned Parenthood clinics averaged between the same day and three days to get an appointment.\n\nIn 2022, across all 68 safety net clinics in the state that take Title X funding, around 24% of the clients were on Medicaid, said Michelle Trupiano, the council's executive director.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

April 30, 2024.\n\nEditorial: Missouri Republicans already banned abortion. Now they're targeting Planned Parenthood\n\nMissouri Republicans are trying to ban abortion twice over.\n\nSound silly? It kind of is. Abortion has been illegal in the state ever since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, of course. If women want or need to terminate a pregnancy, they're either out of luck or have to head out of state, perhaps next door to Kansas where the procedure remains legal if increasingly regulated.\n\nFor now, though, you can't get a legal abortion in the Show-Me State, except in emergencies.\n\nBut that's not quite enough for Republicans in Jefferson City. They voted last week to block Medicaid dollars from going to Planned Parenthood and its health care clinics across the state.\n\nWhy? Abortion of course.\n\n\"This is not health care,\" said state Rep. Mazzie Christensen of Bethany. \"These facilities should not be in our state and I'm sick and tired of hearing about it.\"\n\nExcept, of course, health care is exactly what Planned Parenthood provides in Missouri. The organization didn't go away just because abortion was banned. It still does breast and cervical cancer screenings, prenatal and postpartum care, along with tests for sexually transmitted diseases. And it even dispenses birth control.\n\nPretty important stuff, if you need it.\n\nBut no abortions. They're illegal except when there is a \"medical emergency\" -- a distinction that health care professionals are not using as a loophole. Only 52 of these cases occurred in the state from June 2022 through 2023, and none of the procedures were performed at Missouri Planned Parenthood clinics, according to the nonprofit Missouri Independent. Which means Missouri Republicans are trying to cut off funds to an organization that can't actually do what it's being defunded for.\n\nAssuming that Gov. Mike Parson signs off on the bill, that means Missouri will be the rare state that has -- in essence -- banned abortions twice. It's a pretty nifty trick, if you think about it. And maybe a pretty great thing, perhaps, if you're anti-abortion rights.\n\nIf you're a woman who just wants to get a cancer screening in places like Joplin or Rolla, though, life is going to get a bit more difficult.\n\nATTEMPTS TO THWART REFERENDUM PETITION\n\nA different reading of the defunding effort, though, is that Missouri Republicans want to make sure that abortion stays banned once.\n\nPro-choice activists, after all, are working to get signatures for their petition to put the issue on the ballot for a statewide referendum. Since Roe fell, similar statewide votes around the country -- even in deep-red states -- have consistently favored those who want to preserve or restore abortion access.\n\nMissouri would probably get the same result. Republicans in the General Assembly know this. That's why they've spent the last few months trying to gut the referendum petition process. They don't want Missouri voters -- the folks who ostensibly hold democratic power in the state -- to actually have a say in whether abortion is legal or illegal.\n\nDefunding Planned Parenthood is more of the same. Even if Missouri voters do restore abortion's legality, Republicans will have taken a step to ensure abortion access remains constrained. The new measure is simply a way of heading the voters off at the pass.\n\n\"Missouri,\" said state Rep. Brian Seitz of Branson, \"will continue to be a pro-life state.\"\n\nEven if Missourians choose otherwise. So much for democracy.\n\nOf course, there's a third way of reading the defunding effort -- which is that Missouri Republicans aren't just trying to crack down on abortion in Missouri. They're working to undermine Planned Parenthood nationwide.\n\nThe new bill \"very much does what we initially intended it to do,\" said state Rep. Cody Smith, who sponsored the original legislation, \"which is to defund abortion providers and their affiliates.\"\n\nThe affiliates? In Missouri. The providers? Not in Missouri. Which suggests that Missouri Republicans are eager to cut back on abortion access beyond this state's borders.\n\nThat's not really their job, though, is it?\n\nSo let's sum up: The bill that defunds Planned Parenthood is bad for women's health in Missouri. It's bad for voter power. And it's a sneaky-but-real example of legislative overreach.\n\nBanning abortion once was bad enough. Banning it twice over, it turns out, is even worse.\n\nSt. Louis Post-Dispatch. May 2, 2024.\n\nEditorial: Bailey, Ashcroft and their party can't stop lying about immigration debate\n\n\"Wildly irresponsible.\" That's how Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey last month described Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas' perfectly responsible invitation to legal migrants to his city to help alleviate its labor shortage.\n\nIn a made-for-Fox News stunt last month, Bailey issued a threatening letter to Lucas laced with dubious legal reasoning, partisan disinformation and a whiff of xenophobia. All of which is typical of Missouri's most wildly irresponsible statewide officeholder.\n\nSecretary of State Jay Ashcroft, a candidate for governor, took it a step further recently with a fundraising video in which he declares emphatically that Lucas \"stated that he wanted to make Kansas City a 'sanctuary city'\" -- an outright lie.\n\nNow some legislative Republicans are getting in on the act, too, repeating that false narrative and threatening to strip Kansas City of all state funding. Talk about wildly irresponsible.\n\nIt all started in mid-April, in the context of two real problems: New York and other cities are having trouble absorbing the influx of legal migrants; and the Kansas City region, undergoing a building boom, is struggling with a labor shortage.\n\nIt was within that context that Mayor Lucas tweeted on April 16: \"All are welcome in Kansas City. Proud to work with my fellow mayors (in Denver and New York) ... to ensure decompression of new arriving communities and collaboration among cities, labor, non-profits, and federal officials.\"\n\nHis post linked to a Bloomberg piece about Lucas' invitation, which reports that the mayor \"has a hunch that migrants with work permits (emphasis added) could help alleviate the labor shortage\" in his region.\n\nClear as that is, Lucas clarified it further in a tweet the next day, specifying (again) that he was referring to \"persons who are lawfully present, with lawful work permits, and the lawful ability to come to our community.\"\n\nDoes anything about that sound \"wildly irresponsible\"?\n\nBailey's letter to Lucas a day later -- which the attorney general promptly, dutifully shared with Fox News -- threatens unspecified \"legal action\" over Lucas' comments. It quotes from statutes that make it illegal to transport undocumented migrants into Missouri or to employ them.\n\nThe letter acknowledges Lucas' specification that he was talking about migrants who are \"lawfully present, with lawful work permits.\" But Bailey then dismisses that element as irrelevant because the federal government's \"open border programs are themselves illegal.\"\n\nIn calling for the hiring of migrants with federally approved work permits, Bailey alleges, \"you are actively encouraging Missouri businesses to become entangled in a fundamentally unlawful program.\"\n\n\"Fundamentally unlawful\" as decreed not by Congress or the courts, mind you, but by one unelected official in one Midwestern state.\n\nThat Missouri's official state lawyer would posit such a baseless, head-spinning rejection of the bedrock constitutional principle of federalism is both unsettling and unsurprising. Whether from instinctive demagoguery or plain old incompetence, Bailey has shown repeatedly a willingness to flout whatever legal principles get in the way of his right-wing performance art as he seeks election to the position he was appointed to last year.\n\nBailey has more than earned another entry in our on-going \" Bailey Tally \" of the worst official offenses from Missouri's very worst statewide officeholder. The updated list will be posted in Thursday's opinion section of STLToday.com.\n\nSecretary of State Ashcroft subsequently demonstrated why he may well be a close second to Bailey in terms of official mendacity among Missouri officeholders.\n\nSince starting his gubernatorial campaign, Ashcroft has shown a distressing eagerness to abuse both his office and plain truth in his zeal to prevent a fair statewide vote on abortion rights and other hot-button issues. But the campaign fundraising video Ashcroft released trying to monetize the fake controversy over Lucas' remarks was a startling exercise in deception even by those low standards.\n\n\"... I was so appalled when the mayor of Kansas City suggested -- well, no, he even stated -- that he wanted to make Kansas City a 'sanctuary city,'\" Ashcroft lied, looking directly into the camera.\n\nAgain: Lucas' comments on welcoming migrant workers were specifically, explicitly in reference to legal residents with legal work permits. \"Kansas City is not a sanctuary city,\" Lucas reiterated to reporters after a recent Kansas City Council meeting. \"Kansas City follows the laws of the state of Missouri,\" which already prohibit any city in the state from becoming a sanctuary for undocumented immigrants.\n\nThat existing prohibition hasn't stopped some Republicans in the Legislature from trying to make it an issue anyway, with threats to strip Kansas City of state funding if it becomes a sanctuary city. That whole legislative enterprise is as meaningless as it is pathetic. Because Lucas has explicitly rejected the very premise, they might as well pass a law prohibiting him from harboring vampires.\n\nIt's all part of today's GOP playbook in Missouri: In the absence of any constructive ideas, the party's elected officials invent dragons to slay: Critical race theory! Woke! DEI!\n\nAnd now the deliberate blurring of the line between legal and illegal migration in a calculated scheme to whip up hatred, fear and votes. That's worse than \"wildly irresponsible.\"\n\nEND", "source": {"uri": "maryvilleforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Maryville Forum"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@maryvilleforum.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Planned Parenthood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Mike Parson today. HB 2634 passed by large margins in the House and the Senate following the release of a video where Planned Parenthood was allegedly caught attempting to traffick a child out of state.\n\nAlthough Missouri is one of the pro-life states where babies are protected, state tax dollars still go to the abortion giant. And that's a problem given a recent expose' showing Planned Parenthood is trafficking teen girls across state lines for secret abortions without their parents even knowing.\n\nSusan Klein, Executive Director of Missouri Right to Life, told LifeNews.com she is elated by the news\n\nPrior to 2020, Missouri restricted family planning funds to abortion providers through the budget process. In 2020, Planned Parenthood and others filed suit against that defunding process and the Missouri Supreme Court agreed that it was unconstitutional but also stated that the defunding could be done by placing the pro-life protective language in statute. Since then, the legislature has attempted to use different language in the budget which has all been found unconstitutional. This year, HB 2634 contained pro-life language to be placed in statute.\n\nIn December, Project Veritas filmed Planned Parenthood employees stating that they would take minor girls across state lines for abortions without their parents' knowledge or consent. In February, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed suit against Planned Parenthood for violations of Missouri laws.\n\nREACH PRO-LIFE PEOPLE WORLDWIDE! Advertise with LifeNews to reach hundreds of thousands of pro-life readers every week. Contact us today.\n\nIn their just released 2022-2023 annual report, Planned Parenthood reported total income of over 2 billion dollars. For the year the annual report covers, Planned Parenthood performed 392,715 abortions, or about 4 in 10 abortions, and abortions outnumbered prenatal care 62 to 1. In addition, Planned Parenthood boosted its abortion numbers by facilitating \"transportation and travel support, financial assistance, and referrals.\"\n\nPro-life Missourians are grateful to House Sponsor, Representative Cody Smith and Senate Handler, Senator Mary Elizabeth Coleman and the Missouri legislators who voted for protecting our firmly held beliefs in the sanctity of human life and prohibiting our tax-dollars from subsidizing the destruction of innocent unborn babies.\n\nSue Liebel, midwest regional director for SBA Pro-Life America, shared her reaction:\n\n\"We applaud Gov. Parson and Republicans for standing up for the rights of girls and parents against the predatory abortion industry. Parents have the right to have a say in their daughters' lives and to protect them from the abusers and sex traffickers Planned Parenthood allegedly enables. We must continue to fight for parents as Planned Parenthood attempts to put an abortion measure on the ballot to wipe parental consent off the books and remove health and safety regulations that protect women and girls.\"\n\nAs LifeNews previously reported in February, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey announced a lawsuit against Planned Parenthood after an expose' video showed officials discussing how they take teen girls out of state for secret abortions.\n\nProject Veritas conducted an investigation just before Christmas this past year in which a journalist entered a Kansas City, Mo. clinic asking how to get an abortion for a 13-year-old. The male reporter was met with certainty and confidence from the staff that although the procedure is illegal in Missouri, the minor could be sent to Kansas for the procedure, and no one would need to know. This not only includes parents, but staff at the school.\n\n\"We can give a doctor's note,\" said the Planned Parenthood managing director known only by her first name, LeShauna, \"We just cut off the letterhead.\"\n\nThe undercover reporter asked the managing director how often they send minors into neighboring Kansas for the procedure.\n\n\"Every day,\" she said, and repeated, \"every day.\"\n\nIn his announcement video, published by Project Veritas, the AG credited Project Veritas's investigation as the impetus for today's legal assault against America's largest abortion provider.\n\n\"Today, I'm proud to announce that the state of Missouri is moving forward with a lawsuit to permanently drive Planned Parenthood from the state of Missouri,\" he said. \"We're seeking a court order enjoining Planned Parenthood from concealing sexual offenses committed against minors, and for conspiring to transport minors across state lines for abortions in violation of state statute.\"\n\n\"What is contained in the investigative video produced by Project Veritas is deplorable. Planned Parenthood by state statute is a mandatory reporter for any sexual offenses against children. And yet in the video, an agent of Planned Parenthood is committed to concealing the fact that a 13-year-old who cannot legally consent to sexual conduct has experienced sexual abuse. This should disgust anyone concerned about the health and safety of women and children in the state of Missouri,\" said Attorney General Bailey.\n\nThe Missouri Attorney General credited Project Veritas with uncovering evidence of Planned Parenthood's criminal activity.\n\nBailey stated, \"This lawsuit is a direct result of the investigation conducted by Project Veritas in November of 2023 that uncovered an agent of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Kansas City, brazenly committed to past, present, and future violations of this state's laws regarding proper parental consent notification, a conspiracy to traffic women out of state for abortions, and a conspiracy to conceal the sexual exploitation of children.\"\n\nThe lawsui seeks a court order enjoining Planned Parenthood from concealing sexual offenses committed against minors, and for conspiring to transport minors across state lines for abortions in violation of state statute. Bailey also called upon state policymakers to use the tools necessary to permanently defund Planned Parenthood. As part of the lawsuit the AG's office will be conducting its own investigation. Planned Parenthood could be facing administrative, civil, and criminal penalties.", "source": {"uri": "lifenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Life News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_ertelt@lifenews.com", "name": "Steven Ertelt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Parson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Parson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Planned Parenthood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Veritas", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Project Veritas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Missouri", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Missouri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medicaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right to life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parental consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Small Business Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/defundplannedparenthood4.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550626", "eventUri": "eng-9550626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Parson to sign law blocking payments to Planned Parenthood amid Senate GOP infighting", "body": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Missouri Gov. Mike Parson says he will sign into law legislation blocking Medicaid dollars from going to Planned Parenthood, a longtime priority for Republicans even as abortion remains banned in the state.\n\nThe legislation bans any public funds, including Medicaid reimbursements, from going to the organization, abortion facilities, or their affiliates. But it has sparked fears that the measure would hurt those who use Planned Parenthood for a variety of health care services.\n\nParson's office said in a news release on Wednesday that the Republican governor would sign the bill Thursday morning at the state Capitol.\n\nWhile it has been a priority for Republicans, the legislation has also widely been viewed inside the Capitol as a way to appease a hard-right faction of senators called the Missouri Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe group has vowed to block the renewal of a crucial series of taxes that fund Medicaid until Parson signed the bill and until lawmakers pass separate legislation to make it harder for Missourians to amend the state constitution.\n\nInfighting among GOP senators threatens to blow up the General Assembly's final two weeks of session and could force lawmakers into a special session. The Freedom Caucus spent roughly 40 hours halting debate in the chamber last week.\n\nSen. Denny Hoskins, a Warrensburg Republican and member of the Freedom Caucus, said he planned to let the bill re-authorizing the taxes, collectively known as the Federal Reimbursement Allowance or FRA, come up for debate following the governor's commitment to signing the bill to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\n\"As far as me personally, I think that since the governor has publicly said that he's going to sign that, I believe that the FRA will not have much resistance as it goes through the Senate,\" he said.\n\nHoskins also said that he expects the Senate to take up a measure to overhaul the state's initiative petition process either \"immediately before or immediately after\" senators debate the bill to renew the taxes for Medicaid.\n\nThe initiative petition legislation would make it harder for voters to amend the Missouri Constitution in part by weakening the voting power of urban areas.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medicaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Planned Parenthood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Parson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Parson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_session", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special session"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_constitution_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State constitution (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Missouri", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of Missouri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrensburg,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warrensburg, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warrensburg, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/288/28849/2884946.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550626", "eventUri": "eng-9550626", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

In 2020, Planned Parenthood and others filed suit against that defunding process and the Missouri Supreme Court agreed that it was unconstitutional but also stated that the defunding could be done by placing the pro-life protective language in statute. The legislature has now successfully placed the pro-life language, which will go into effect at the end of August, in statute.\n\nIn December, Planned Parenthood staff in Missouri were filmed by Project Veritas, stating that they would take minor girls across state lines for abortions without their parents' knowledge or consent. In February, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed suit against Planned Parenthood for violations of Missouri laws.\n\nLifeNews is on GETTR. Please follow us for the latest pro-life news\n\nIn their recently released 2022-2023 annual report, Planned Parenthood reported total income of over 2 billion dollars. For the year the annual report covers, Planned Parenthood performed 392,715 abortions, or about 4 in 10 abortions, and abortions outnumbered prenatal care 62 to 1. In addition, according to their report, Planned Parenthood boosted its abortion numbers by facilitating \"transportation and travel support, financial assistance, and referrals.\"\n\nPro-life Missourians are grateful to House Sponsor, Representative Cody Smith and Senate Handler, Senator Mary Elizabeth Coleman, to the many pro-life Representatives and Senators who voted to stop the subsidization of the abortion industry and protect pre-born babies and their mothers.

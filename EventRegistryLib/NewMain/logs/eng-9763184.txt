This scheme had proved to be a game-changer for the BJP in the last elections as smashed the previous Biju Janata Dal (BJD) government's women vote bank. During election campaigns in the state, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that the BJP will roll out Subhadra Yojana if it came to power in the state.\n\nThe budget also saw the government allocating Rs 1,166 crore for Lakhpati Yojana, a scheme that proposed by the BJP in its election manifesto.\n\nThe budget proposed Rs 3,056 crore outlay for Gopabandhu Jana Arogya Yojana, a scheme which is seen as a replacement of the previous BJD government's Biju Swasthya Kalayan Yojana. Similarly, 1935 crore has been given for CM Kisan Nidhi Yojana, a scheme that is seen as replacement of Biju Swasthya Kalya Yojana.\n\nThe CM announced that the state government will introduce Odia Bhasha Bruti, a scholarship for promotion of Odia language.\n\nAn outlay of Rs 6,665 crore has been made for the metro railway project connecting Trisulia in Cuttack to Bhubaneswar airport. For Mukhya Mantri Sadak Yojana, an outlay of Rs 3190 crore has been made.\n\nThe budget saw a whopping allocation of Rs 4,487 crore for Madhubabu Pension Yojana.\n\nThe CM announced to launch Utkarsh Utkal by initiative to woo domestic and foreign direct investments (FDIs). While the government targets to mop up 2.50 lakh crore investment proposals from the domestic players, it aims $ 2 billion FDIs.\n\nThe CM took more than three hours to read out the 45-page budget speech.", "source": {"uri": "deccanchronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Chronicle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "akshaya_kumar_sahoo@deccanchronicle.com", "name": "Akshaya Kumar Sahoo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subhadra", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Subhadra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odia_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Odia language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Odisha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Odisha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhubaneswar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bhubaneswar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bhubaneswar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biju_Janata_Dal", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biju Janata Dal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurukh_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kurukh language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biju_Patnaik_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biju Patnaik International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapid transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign direct investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuttack", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cuttack"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cuttack"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/07/25/1826617-untitleddesign6.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763184", "eventUri": "eng-9763184", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bhubaneswar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

BJD MLA Pratap Dev criticized it for lack of innovation, while former CM Naveen Patnaik termed it a double disappointment. State Deputy CM Paravati Parida and Deputy CM KV Sing Deo praised it for its focus on welfare and development.\n\nLaunching a scathing attack against Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi-led Odisha government over the state budget 2024-25 presented on Thursday, BJD MLA Pratap Dev said there is nothing new in the budget. 'If you see today's budget, it's recasting the last govt's budget... The appalling thing is what they have propagated once they came into the govt that they will look into the issues in new ways, but I see nothing new, the old schemes have been renamed. Prima facie the govt has tried to keep its poll promise and secondly, the last government's agenda has been carbon copied,' said Pratap Dev.\n\nFormer Odisha CM and LoP Naveen Patnaik slammed the state budget, saying it was the double-engine but double disappointment. 'About the Union budget, I will say - it was the double-engine but double disappointment. About the state budget, I would say - I noticed that more than 40 of my govt schemes have just been renamed. I will go through it in detail and then I'll comment on the budget,' he said.\n\nMeanwhile, countering the opposition and appreciating the state budget, State Deputy CM Pravati Parida said this is the first government that delivers what it has promised. 'We formed the govt saying that it will be a people's govt... The previous govt used to talk but never made provisions in the budget. Our govt does what it says... Our target is to make 25 lakhs 'lakhpati didi' by 2027. This is the first govt that has started delivering what it had said...' she stated.\n\nOdisha Deputy CM KV Sing Deo said the state budget is for the welfare of the poor, women, and youth. 'Today, the CM has presented the first budget of BJP in Odisha. The budget has two parts - the agriculture budget and the general budget. It includes what the PM has emphasized. It is for the poor, women, youth... The CM has tried to ensure the overall development. This is a people's budget, a people-oriented budget that will help in the development of Odisha...' he added.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the Odisha government on Thursday presented a Rs 2.65 lakh crore budget for the 2024-25 fiscal.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deputy_chief_ministers_of_Maharashtra", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "List of deputy chief ministers of Maharashtra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biju_Janata_Dal", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Biju Janata Dal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naveen_Patnaik", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Naveen Patnaik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvati", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parvati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Odisha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Odisha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/25_07_2024_22_49_47_1573542.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763184", "eventUri": "eng-9763184", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

The terrifying event resulted in one fatality and another injury, with multiple cars also bearing damages. The accused, 39-year-old Julio Rodarte, has since been apprehended and faces charges of murder as well as 10 counts of attempted homicide.

Now he might be released early' The single fatality, a man identified as Victor Hugo Leon, was driving home after an overnight shift at work and was only minutes away from his destination, according to his family. He leaves behind three sons and one daughter. The condition of the person who was injured is unclear. Enrique Tores, owner of E&E Tires, close to the site of the shooting, recounted the ordeal. He told KABC: \"It's so sad you know, very sad. In the back, there were five or six people working you know, and I was afraid he would get in my business and start shooting people.\" Rodarte allegedly initially stopped at a nearby market attempting to purchase alcohol, but he didn't have enough money. He left the store, went on the street and brandished his firearm, instigating the attack. Once he'd dispensed of the clip, then the weapon, Tores claimed that he proceeded to undress completely. \"He was completely naked, and he just kept walking. And that's when they called the cops,\" said Tores. Police promptly arrived on the scene and arrested him.

{"id": 237079572, "title": "Boston gears up for Juneteenth celebrations", "text": "Boston hoisted the Juneteenth flag over City Hall Plaza on Monday, heralding a week of celebrations and commemoration of the day in 1865 when the news of emancipation finally stretched all the way across the country. \u201cTrue freedom is expansive and affirmative, and as the cradle of liberty, Boston doesn\u2019t just recognize that freedom, we are determined to maintain it,\u201d said Mayor Michelle Wu. \u201cThe flag we are about to raise is as American as the one with 13 stripes and 50 stars. It is red, white and blue, and it has one star surrounded by its glow, representing the freedom at the core of our democracy.\u201d City leaders and organizers gathered in the plaza at noon Monday to raise the flag and speak on the meaning of the holiday in Boston. Juneteenth marks the anniversary of the day on June 19, 1865, when the Union army reached Galveston, Texas, to tell enslaved African Americans of their emancipation. The Juneteenth flag was designed by now 80-year-old Boston activist Ben Haith in 1997. The Boston area has a host of activities planned to mark the holiday.

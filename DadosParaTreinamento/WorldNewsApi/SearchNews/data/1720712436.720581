{"id": 232009562, "title": "Pope Francis: Money, Power and\u00a0Pleasure\u00a0Can Enslave Us; Freedom Is Found in Christ", "text": "Pope Francis urged people to reflect on Sunday on whether they are sacrificing their serenity and freedom to be enslaved by money, power and pleasure. Speaking in his Angelus address on June 9, the Pope asked people to contemplate the temptations that can imprison us and the freedom found in Christ. \u201cIf we let ourselves be conditioned by the quest for pleasure, power, money or consensus, we become slaves to these things,\u201d he said. \u201cIf, instead, we allow God\u2019s freely given love to fill us and expand our heart, and if we let it overflow spontaneously by giving it back to others with our whole selves without fear, calculation or conditioning, then we grow in freedom and spread its good fragrance around us in our homes, in our families and in our communities.\u201d In his speech from the window of the Vatican\u2019s Apostolic Palace, the Pope highlighted the many ways in which \u201cJesus was a free man.\u201d Jesus was not enslaved by wealth, but embraced \u201ca poor life full of uncertainties, freely taking care of the sick and whoever came to ask him for help, without ever asking for anything in return.\u201d \u201cHe was free with regard to power,\u201d Francis added. \u201cIndeed, despite calling many to follow him, he never obliged anyone to do so, nor did he ever seek out the support of the powerful, but always took the side of the least, teaching his disciples to do likewise.\u201d The Lord was also free from the need \u201cfor fame and approval, and for this reason, he never gave up speaking the truth,\u201d he said. Pope Francis underlined that Jesus never gave up speaking the truth \u201ceven at the cost of not being understood or becoming unpopular \u2014 even to the point of dying on the cross.\u201d The Pope added that Jesus did not allow himself \u201cto be intimidated, bought or corrupted by anything or anyone.\u201d Pope Francis asked people to spend some time reflecting on \u201cthis freedom of Jesus\u201d and then to examine their consciences as to whether there are any areas in life where they are \u201cimprisoned by the myths of money, power and success.\u201d After leading the crowd gathered in St. Peter\u2019s Square in the Angelus prayer in Latin, the Pope made a passionate appeal for peace in the Holy Land, asking people to pray for the cease-fire negotiations and urging the international community to ensure that humanitarian aid arrives for those who are most in need. Pope Francis also asked people to pray for the people who are suffering in Myanmar and Ukraine, giving a special shout-out to some Ukrainians who were in the crowd waving flags. \u201cMay the Virgin Mary help us live and love like Jesus taught us, in the freedom of the children of God,\u201d Pope Francis said.", "summary": "cna", "url": "https://www.ncregister.com/cna/pope-francis-money-power-and-pleasure-can-enslave-us-freedom-is-found-in-christ", "image": "https://publisher-ncreg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pb-ncregister/swp/hv9hms/media/2024060908064_5c400b4eec6f56832b4d0e23fd4c8fa7aa4b16f4a5885046aaab809740a6b854.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:34:17", "author": "Courtney Mares/cna", "authors": ["Courtney Mares/cna"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.093}

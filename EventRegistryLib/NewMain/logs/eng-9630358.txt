Crawford said some businesses will open sooner than others if they immediately provide a plan to comply with state laws and regulations.\n\n\"Everything is contingent on how quickly the state can turn around those licenses,\" said Jason Erkes, spokesman for Cresco Labs and Sunnyside dispensaries. \"But whenever it is, we'll be ready to go for the product to hit the stores, and the stores will be ready to welcome new consumers into the doors.\"\n\nKate Ols, executive vice president of the Midwest and New England regions for Acreage Holdings, said she expects recreational sales at Acreage's The Botanist dispensaries to begin in mid- to late June.\n\nHow much recreational marijuana can I have?\n\nAdults 21 and older can possess up to 2.5 ounces of cannabis and 15 grams of extracts or edibles.\n\nWhat do I need to bring with me to buy recreational marijuana?\n\nCustomers will need to bring an ID to purchase recreational marijuana. It's illegal for dispensaries to sell to anyone under 21.\n\nFor payment, cash is king. This is because federal banking regulations open banks and credit card companies up to legal liability for accepting payment for cannabis.\n\nSome dispensaries in the state accept debit cards for cashless ATM transactions, which also require a fee. The use of debit cards for marijuana has proven a contentious topic, with Mastercard last year instructing banks not to allow cannabis purchases, according to The New York Times.\n\nCustomers who don't bring cash can take money out of on-site ATMs for a fee. At The Botanist, another option is to provide your bank account information for an automated clearing house (ACH) payment with no fee, Ols said.\n\nThe Citizen's dispensaries in Canton and Lorain also process ACH transactions, said Pete Nischt, vice president of communications and compliance at Klutch Cannabis, The Citizen's parent company.\n\n\"It's more convenient for consumers, it's legal, it's compliant and it's kind of an added precaution in helping a store mitigate the amount of money that it has to keep on hand,\" he said.\n\nCan my employer bar me from using recreational cannabis?\n\nYes. Employers can still ban marijuana use and drug test employees for it.\n\nHow is law enforcement cracking down on people driving while high?\n\nIt's still illegal to drive under the influence of marijuana, and passengers can't smoke or vape in the vehicle. The state's OVI laws apply to anyone who violates those rules.\n\nLaw enforcement can conduct multiple tests to determine if a driver is under the influence of cannabis, according to Dominy Law Firm. Field test results can signal to the officer whether they should arrest the driver.\n\nPolice typically conduct a blood or urine test for drugs and alcohol after an arrest.\n\nUnder Ohio law, presumed impaired driving equates to \"at least 2 nanograms of marijuana in your blood or at least 10 nanograms of marijuana per milliliter of your urine,\" according to The Farrish Law Firm.\n\nWhat types of recreational marijuana products can I buy at dispensaries in Ohio?\n\nAt first, Ohio's dual-licensed marijuana businesses will sell the same types of products they currently offer in the medical market.\n\nThat means there won't be pre-rolls or concentrates with more than 70% THC for sale right away. Those could appear on shelves starting around September, provided the law doesn't change. As passed by voters, it increased the THC cap for extracts to 90% and lifted a ban on combustion, or burning cannabis with a flame.\n\nAvailable non-plant-based accessories at numerous Ohio dispensaries include vaporizers for flower and concentrates, vape batteries and cartridges that can be filled with concentrates, and grinders for breaking up flower.\n\nHow much will recreational marijuana cost in Ohio?\n\nDepending on the product type and if there is a deal in place, prices for some dispensary products can be as low as $10 pre-tax. They can also be hundreds of dollars.\n\nBuckeye Relief CEO Andy Rayburn said flower could be more expensive in the short-term until growers can increase supply around the state. But he expects the cost of edibles and vape cartridges to stay roughly the same.\n\n\"The price for legal medical marijuana products has come down drastically in the last 2\u00bd years,\" Rayburn said.\n\nWhile prices are generally lower in other states, such as Michigan, it is illegal for customers to transport marijuana across state lines.\n\nWhat are the taxes on recreational marijuana?\n\nOhio will impose a 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana. That's in addition to the 5.75% state sales tax on tangible goods.\n\nAdditional, local taxes vary by county, and in some parts of the state, there is a transit authority tax, according to the Ohio Department of Taxation.\n\nWhere does my tax money go when I buy recreational marijuana?\n\nRevenue from the 10% excise tax goes to four pots of money:\n\nWhat if I'm a medical marijuana patient?\n\nCrawford said the Division of Cannabis Control proposed rules that would require dispensaries to accommodate patients and caregivers, which could mean setting aside products or having dedicated hours for them. Licensees would also have to ensure there's enough inventory for patients.\n\nMedical marijuana patients won't be subject to the 10% excise tax.\n\nWill I start seeing marijuana billboards everywhere like in Michigan and some other states?\n\nThis is unlikely. Crawford said rules for marijuana advertising need to be finalized, but they will be similar to the advertising rules in the state's medical cannabis program.\n\nCurrently, Crawford said, \"any advertisements with a high likelihood of reaching persons under the age of 18 are prohibited.\"\n\nPatrick Williams covers growth and development for the Akron Beacon Journal.

Chuck Edwards (R-NC) indicated he will file an amendment to remove marijuana banking protections from a key spending bill because \"our country has never allowed a federally illegal activity to be banked\" -- adding that cannabis is \"dangerous\" and \"causes irreparable harm.\"\n\nNew Hampshire senators on a marijuana legalization conference committee said they are willing to accept some House proposals but still need more time to consider others.

Chuck Edwards (R-NC) spoke out against the cannabis banking section, which subcommittee chairman Rep. Dave Joyce (R-OH) secured in the base bill.\n\n\"I understand it's not in order to propose amendments at this level, but I certainly intend to raise that issue at the appropriate time,\" Edwards said, signaling that he will propose an amendment to remove the section in the full committee or on the floor.\n\nHe said that the proposal is not germane to an appropriations bill because, he argues, it is \"an affirmative authorization disguised as a limitation\" on the spending of funds.

None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to penalize a financial institution solely because the institution provides financial services to an entity that is a manufacturer, a producer, or a person that participates in any business or organized activity that involves handling hemp, hemp-derived cannabinoid products, other hemp-derived cannabinoid products, marijuana, marijuana products, or marijuana proceeds, and engages in such activity pursuant to a law established by a State, political subdivision of a State, or Indian Tribe. In this section, the term ''State'' means each of the several States, the District of Columbia, and any territory or possession of the United States.\n\n\"Our country has never allowed a federally illegal activity to be banked. And it's important to note that, despite some states trying to legalize it, marijuana is still a Schedule I drug,\" the congressman -- who introduced legislation last year to slash federal funding from individual states and Indian tribes that legalize marijuana -- said.\n\n\"Marijuana is still illegal, and I believe that it should remain illegal,\" he said.\n\n\"It's dangerous, and more and more evidence is being found that it causes irreparable harm, particularly to younger minds, but we can have that debate in other committees,\" he said, adding that the section amounts to \"selective provision\" of the standalone Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act that Joyce is sponsoring and that it \"results in a deviation from federal law that would significantly alter the way that America does business.\"\n\n\"While I admire the tenacity and ambition of members who have supported this provision, its place is not in an appropriations bill,\" Edwards said. \"I certainly look forward to additional discussion, and in the interest of not providing any surprises, I wanted to make sure that you're aware of that.\"\n\nEdwards has also opposed legislation that cleared committee last year to prevent the denial of federal employment or security clearances based on a candidate's past marijuana use. And he's also been critical of the Biden administration's move to reschedule cannabis, suggesting that it would increase youth access even though the reclassification would not legalize marijuana.\n\nJoyce, meanwhile, told Marijuana Moment on Tuesday that \"forcing cannabis businesses to operate in all cash is a magnet for violent crime,\" adding that his legislation \"remedies these issues by further safeguarding the safe, adult use of cannabis and increasing the safety of cannabis businesses and their employees.\"\n\nIn addition to the cannabis banking section, the FSGG spending legislation also notably omits a longstanding rider from prohibitionist Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD) that's blocked Washington, D.C. from using its local tax dollars to legalize recreational marijuana sales.\n\nThe same Appropriations subcommittee under Democratic control similarly omitted the D.C. cannabis sales ban and included the banking section in a spending bill for fiscal year 2022, but it did not make it into the final package.\n\nThis current version of the legislation from the panel led by Joyce does include at least one drug policy provision that advocates oppose, including language preventing the use of D.C. local funds to manage a syringe exchange program.\n\nThe bill also seeks to interfere in various other local policy matters in the District of Columbia, including abortion, contraceptives, assisted suicide, voting by non-citizens, firearms, vehicle emissions and even right turns at red lights -- highlighting the importance of removing the cannabis rider specifically for Joyce, the subcommittee chair.\n\n--\n\nMarijuana Moment is tracking more than 1,500 cannabis, psychedelics and drug policy bills in state legislatures and Congress this year.

(VA) doctors to issue medical marijuana recommendations to military veterans and support psychedelics research and access at VA.\n\nRepublican members of Congress are also seeking to eliminate a provision of a separate defense bill that would block military branches from testing recruits for marijuana as a condition of enlistment, while other members push for a variety of new drug policy amendments that would prevent security clearance denials based on past cannabis use, expand expungement eligibility and facilitate the rescheduling of certain psychedelics, among other reforms.\n\nThe proposals are being pursued as part of the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which cleared the House Armed Services Committee last month and must now also go before the Rules Committee before potentially reaching the floor.\n\nOhio Officials Post Recreational Marijuana License Application Materials To Prepare Market Launch", "source": {"uri": "marijuanamoment.net", "dataType":

The ordinance was passed in an 8-2 vote, with Tribal Council member Dike Sneed and council Vice Chairman David Wolfe voting against.\n\nThe marijuana market has been touted as a huge economic boon for the EBCI, as the drug remains illegal in North Carolina.\n\nNorth Carolina state legislators have not legalized the drug for medical or recreational purposes, despite some bills being proposed to do such, but President Joe Biden recently moved to reclassify the drug from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug, meaning it could become federally legal to prescribe marijuana as medication.\n\nThe EBCI land -- known as the Qualla Boundary -- is a sovereign nation that has its own elections, laws, government and institutions that are self-governed and autonomous. It lies primarily in the Western North Carolina mountain counties of Swain and Jackson, with smaller parts in Cherokee, Graham and Haywood.\n\nThe Great Smoky Cannabis Co., run by Qualla Enterprises LLC, opened for medical marijuana sales on April 20 with customers travelling across the state with medical marijuana cards to make a purchase. The dispensary could not open for recreational sales due to the Tribal Council not yet passing the ordinance, despite numerous work sessions on the topic.\n\nThe passage of the ordinance comes on the heels of a May 30 work session on the recreational marijuana ordinance.\n\nDuring that session, Qualla Enterprises General Manager Forrest Parker said the goal after a positive vote on the amendments would be to establish recreational marijuana sales for tribal members within \"30-45 days\" and that the general public would see sales open within a \"60-75 day range.\"\n\nThe timeline sets the opening of North Carolina's first recreational cannabis market for August.\n\nFor the Great Smoky Cannabis Co., the only regulatory change would be that the business would need a license from the tribal government to sell recreational marijuana, Parker said. Otherwise, the regulations on sales set under the current medical marijuana program would largely remain the same.\n\nThe major change would be hiring the staff required to run the estimated \"80,000 pound\" regional adult use market that will be operating out of the single dispensary, Parker said. He noted the market currently only has funding for around half of the estimated regional market.\n\nQualla Enterprises Human Resources Director Lee Griffin had previously stated that estimated staffing would be around 350 under a recreational marijuana market during a Feb. 28 work session on the ordinance.\n\nThe Citizen Times reached out to the Great Smoky Cannabis Co. and the office of EBCI Chief Michell Hicks June 6.\n\nAmendments restrict hemp shops, home grow practices\n\nCouncil member Michael Stamper introduced an optional amendment to the ordinance that would restrict hemp products from being sold at any other location beside EBCI-owned entities. The move would set up Great Smoky Cannabis Co. as the only hemp store on the Qualla Boundary.\n\nStamper justified the amendment by stating an increased number of smoke shops would be \"an eyesore on the community,\" and would rather have \"one big shop rather than nine vape shops.\" He also mentioned he was worried about the proliferation of hemp product into local schools.\n\nThe optional amendment was accepted into the ordinance by the Tribal Council.\n\nAnother amendment regarding the practice of growing marijuana plants to those who possess medical cards was introduced. The amendment allow only four plants at a time. The amendment was also accepted by the Tribal Council.\n\nNorth Carolina law enforcement say statement stands 'as is'\n\nAs the EBCI moves to open North Carolina's first marijuana market, local and state officials have had a variety of reactions.\n\nLast year, WNC Republican Congressman Chuck Edwards introduced the \"Stop Pot Act\" in response to the EBCI, which would remove federal funding from tribes and states that have legalized marijuana.\n\nIn early April, District Attorney Ashley Hornsby Welch vowed to \"enforce state law\" in response to the dispensary opening, but noted the district will respect tribal sovereignty. Welch is the chief criminal prosecutor in Prosecutorial District 43, which includes Cherokee, Clay, Graham, Haywood, Jackson, Macon and Swain counties.\n\nOn the evening of June 4, District 43 spokesperson Quintin Ellison said the April statement \"would stand as previously released\" in reaction to the possible passage of the recreational marijuana ordinance.\n\nMedical marijuana cards required until recreational opens\n\nUntil recreational marijuana opens at the Great Smoky Cannabis Co. dispensary, a medical marijuana card is required to purchase at the dispensary.\n\nTo qualify for a medical marijuana card in Cherokee, you must show proof of one or more of the following 17 conditions:\n\nAll patients must be 21 years or older to purchase medical cannabis. Fees for medical cannabis patient cards are $100 for N.C. residents and $50 for enrolled EBCI members. Cards must be renewed yearly at a rate of $100 for N.C. residents and $25 for EBCI members.\n\nLearn more\n\nFor more on how to obtain a medical marijuana card, visit the EBCI's Cannabis Control Board

Marijuana Sales Ban And Adds Cannabis Banking Protections In Key Spending Bill - Marijuana Moment", "body": "A GOP House committee has unveiled a large-scale spending bill that omits a longstanding rider blocking Washington, D.C. from legalizing recreational marijuana sales and separately adds new protections for banks that work with state-legal cannabis businesses.\n\nThe House Appropriations Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) Subcommittee posted its 2025 fiscal year spending measure on Tuesday, with a markup on the legislation scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nThe notable cannabis-related changes from past sessions come under the panel's new leadership. Rep. Dave Joyce (R-OH), co-chair of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus, and the lead sponsor of standalone bipartisan marijuana banking legislation, is charing the subcommittee.\n\nThe District of Columbia has been barred from using its local tax dollars to implement a commercial cannabis market for years under a rider from Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD). Lawmakers have attempted to remove the prohibition several times without success. But now the provision has been excluded from the base bill, a move that would require Harris or other supports to proactively seek to add it back in via an amendment.\n\nEven President Joe Biden has consistently maintained the D.C. ban in his budget proposals, making it all the more notable that it was removed from a version in a GOP-controlled committee.\n\n\"As subcommittee chairman, I ensure the provisions in this bill only take strides to make our communities safer,\" Joyce told Marijuana Moment on Tuesday. \"I appreciate that a few of my colleagues have concerns with the safety of readily accessible cannabis products -- I share these, but blocking their regulation only exacerbates these issues.\"\n\nLawmakers in the District have enacted certain workarounds, including allowing people to self-certify as medical marijuana patients, but the congressional blockade has been a consistent source of frustration.\n\nAlso, the newly introduced FSGG legislation includes language to prevent federal regulators from penalizing financial institutions for working with state-licensed marijuana and hemp businesses.\n\nSEC. 134. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to penalize a financial institution solely because the institution provides financial services to an entity that is a manufacturer, a producer, or a person that participates in any business or organized activity that involves handling hemp, hemp-derived cannabinoid products, other hemp-derived cannabinoid products, marijuana, marijuana products, or marijuana proceeds, and engages in such activity pursuant to a law established by a State, political subdivision of a State, or Indian Tribe. In this section, the term ''State'' means each of the several States, the District of Columbia, and any territory or possession of the United States.\n\nThe protections are less robust than the standalone Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act that Joyce is sponsoring, as the restriction is only binding on agencies covered under FSGG, which do not include the Justice Department, and would only cover a single fiscal year unless extended.\n\nThe congressman told Marijuana Moment that \"forcing cannabis businesses to operate in all cash is a magnet for violent crime,\" adding that his legislation \"remedies these issues by further safeguarding the safe, adult use of cannabis and increasing the safety of cannabis businesses and their employees.\"\n\nSenate Democratic leadership has repeatedly discussed their intent to advance their version of the banking bill this session, but it's unclear when that might materialize.\n\nThe same Appropriations subcommittee under Democratic control similarly omitted the D.C. cannabis sales ban and included the banking section in a spending bill for fiscal year 2022, but it did not make it into the final package.\n\nThis current version of the legislation from the panel led by Joyce does include at least one drug policy provision that advocates oppose, including language preventing the use of D.C. local funds to manage a syringe exchange program.\n\nThe bill also seeks to interfere in various other local policy matters in the District of Columbia, including abortion, contraceptives, assisted suicide, voting by non-citizens, firearms, vehicle emissions and even right turns at red lights -- highlighting the importance of removing the cannabis rider specifically for Joyce, the subcommittee chair.\n\nMeanwhile, the House Rules Committee on Monday approved amendments to a separate spending bill that would authorize U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) doctors to issue medical marijuana recommendations to military veterans and support psychedelics research and access -- allowing floor votes on the measures, expected this week. The panel rejected another proposal to block cannabis testing for federal job applicants in states that have enacted legalization, however.", "source": {"uri": "marijuanamoment.net", "dataType":

The exemption, signed into law in March by Gov. Jay Inslee (D), applies specifically to products that have been certified to higher testing standards than typical state-legal products.\n\nMedical marijuana cardholders were already eligible for exemptions from Washington's sales and use taxes on cannabis, but they were not exempt from the state's excise tax, one of the highest in the country.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by Rep. Sharon Wylie (D) and two other Democrats allows state-registered patients and caregivers to avoid the tax when purchasing products that are compliant with Department of Health (DOH) testing standards, which are more rigorous than typical state cannabis standards. Manufacturers in the state are required to submit all medical and adult-use products to labs for testing, but producers can voluntarily have additional testing done -- to screen for heavy metals, for example -- that isn't otherwise required.\n\nMarijuana that passes the additional testing can be labeled with a DOH-developed logo, which now also serves as an indication that the product is tax-free for patients and caretakers.\n\nMany states with both adult-use and medical marijuana already exempt patients from taxes.\n\nWashington's tax break is only temporary. As written, the new law is set to expire on June 30, 2029. A report by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee on the revenue impacts of the change is due in 2028.\n\nOne of the bill's co-sponsors, Rep. Shelley Kloba (D) also sponsored a cannabis homegrow bill this session -- the latest in a series of such measures introduced over the past several years -- but the proposal ultimately died in committee. If passed, HB 2194 would have allowed adults 21 and older to grow up to four plants per person, with no more than 10 allowed per household. Home cultivation of marijuana without a medical marijuana card remains a felony in the state.\n\nKloba told Marijuana Momentthat she's co mmitted to continued advocacy for the policy change and plans to introduce yet another homegrow measure next year.\n\n\"I am committed to this issue, and plan to run a bill again next session,\" she said. \"Every session has its own character and constraints, which so far have meant that the bill has not advanced to the Senate. But I am not giving up.\"\n\nWashington voters legalized marijuana for adult use through a ballot measure in 2012.\n\nAnother cannabis bill introduced in Washington this session would have rolled back recently enacted protections for job applicants who use marijuana, undoing anti-discrimination protections for people seeking to work in the drug treatment industry. It did not receive committee consideration in time to advance, however.\n\nLawmakers also introduced legislation to create a legal system to allow veterans and first responders to access psychedelic-assisted therapy. The measure would have built on a limited pilot program signed into law last year, but it also did not advanced after being filed.\n\nLate last year, the state's Department of Commerce issued recommendations regarding how $200 million should be spent to address racial, economic and social disparities created by the war on drugs. Washington has also approved $10 million in refunds for vacated drug convictions.\n\nIn April, meanwhile, state marijuana regulators began amending rules related to social equity ownership of cannabis businesses, an effort to encourage more diverse ownership and reduce obstacles to licensing, including from past drug-related convictions.", "source": {"uri": "marijuanamoment.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marijuana Moment"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_adlin@marijuanamoment.net", "name": "Ben Adlin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_cannabis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medical cannabis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Wylie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sharon Wylie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Use tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_(Philippines)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Department of Health (Philippines)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Inslee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jay Inslee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Excise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_Kloba", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shelley Kloba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heavy metals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_drugs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War on drugs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Cannabis", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Cannabis", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs/Cannabis", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs/Cannabis", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.marijuanamoment.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/marijuana-stethoscope-prescription-pad-rx.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630358", "eventUri": "eng-9630358", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

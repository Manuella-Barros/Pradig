The Times, the Daily Express, and the Independent all splash with a fresh racism row courtesy of a Reform UK activist, who was recorded using a slur to refer to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Across the pond, the Daily Telegraph, the Financial Times, and The Guardian lead on Joe Biden after his disastrous US presidential debate, with a warning from the Democrats that he has one week to shape up or ship out. The Daily Star also used the US debate as its front page, with a rather barbed headline calling Republican candidate Donald Trump a \u201cmanbaby\u201d.

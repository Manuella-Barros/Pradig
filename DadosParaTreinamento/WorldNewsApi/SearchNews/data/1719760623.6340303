{"id": 225008204, "title": "Intersolar Europe: How About Some More?", "text": "The latest technologies in operation and maintenance Artificial intelligence (AI) is all the rage right now. It is also increasingly being used in the solar industry, especially in operations and maintenance (O&M). The AI-driven detection and analysis of incidents and deviations in operations and the standardized creation and selection of tickets are processes in which AI can be used to quickly process large amounts of data. In O&M, AI helps free up human resources for more complex tasks and standardize operations. What\u2019s more, AI-supported software solutions can process weather data and create generation forecasts. Special solar systems: parking lot PV, agricultural PV and floating PV With Solar Package I, the \u201cspecial solar systems\u201d defined in the German Renewable Energy Sources Act EEG now have their own tender segment. These applications are becoming more prevalent and dual land use concepts are coming to the forefront of solar deployment plans. The maximum value for tenders has been raised to 9.5 cents/kWh. The products in this segment are rapidly evolving: carport substructures, elevated vertical and horizontal solar technology with and without trackers for agricultural PV, and mounting solutions for floating PV. Intersolar Europe As the world\u2019s leading exhibition for the solar industry, Intersolar Europe demonstrates the enormous vitality of the solar market. For more than 30 years, it has been providing a networking opportunity for key players, focusing on the latest trends, developments and business models under the motto \u201cConnecting Solar Business\u201d. Intersolar Europe will take place from June 19\u201321, 2024 as part of The smarter E Europe at Messe M\u00fcnchen. For more information, please visit: www.intersolar.de.

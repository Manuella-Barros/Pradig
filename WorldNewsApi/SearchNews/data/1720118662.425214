Have a question for Care and Feeding? Submit it here. Dear Care and Feeding, My mom is the worst. My dad is mostly great when she\u2019s not around but doesn\u2019t stand up to her when she is. They weren\u2019t abusive parents, but they weren\u2019t good ones either. My husband and I know better than to leave them in charge of our kids without our supervision. Recently, we were visiting them and their dog got out. My husband went to coax her back. While he was doing that, our toddler had a nightmare diaper accident, so I went to get him cleaned up. In that 15-minute window of unsupervised time, my mom scooped up our 5-year-old and just drove off. No car seat. No telling anyone she\u2019d left. He was in his PJs and it was a cold, rainy spring day. My dad thought my mom was napping. I knocked on all the neighbors\u2019 doors and eventually, I called 911 because they live in a lakeside area and there have been child drownings there. When we realized the car was gone, I called and texted her repeatedly and she didn\u2019t answer. She came home five hours later and I lit into her. She told me I was overreacting, and that she didn\u2019t ask if she could take him out because she knew I\u2019d \u201cobsess\u201d (her word) over the car seat. My son said he\u2019d called out for me when they left and she told him to hush, that this was a secret. My dad went after me for upsetting my mom. We left and haven\u2019t spoken since. I\u2019m feeling like the next time she\u2019ll get to see my kids is from her casket. My husband feels even more strongly. But now my dad has fallen and he broke a hip, and I only found out through a cousin. Not being in touch with my mom means I don\u2019t get to see my dad, but he keeps trying to reach out in ways that loop her in when I try to talk to him. How do I deal with this? I\u2019m furious. But he is in the hospital and not getting younger, so I\u2019ll have to face this sooner or later. \u2014Furious Mom Dear Furious Mom, I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have to tell you that you had every right to be furious. (Though perhaps I should tell you that it sounds like your mother may have a mental health disorder, and that she needs professional care. Not that you\u2019re in a position to insist on that\u2014but it might be worth bringing up to your father, carefully and gently, or to someone else who would be receptive and who has some influence on her. The situation you describe does not sound like mere eccentricity or grandmotherly hijinks.) Now that some time has passed, I\u2019m wondering if you might want to reconsider the complete banishment of her from your life. Certainly, I\u2019d never leave her alone with the children (not even for five minutes). But are you sure you want to cut her out of your\u2014and their\u2014life for the rest of hers? Perhaps you are. If so (and I\u2019m not going to judge you for that\u2014this experience on your last visit might well have been her latest affront, and cutting ties with her has been long coming), you may have to face the fact that you will lose your father too. Can you live with that? It\u2019s clear that he can\u2019t bear the situation as it currently exists. He wants his wife and his daughter to have a relationship. And it\u2019s true, he\u2019s not the one who gets to decide that. But if he won\u2019t let up on trying to connect you with your mother, if you are adamant about not wanting to have anything to do with her, you may have to make a choice: Give him up too, or let her back in. You don\u2019t want to demand that he make a choice between the two of you. I\u2019ve witnessed this, and I know how devastating it is to a child (yes, even a full-grown one) when a parent, asked to choose, chooses their spouse, not their child.

Dear Care and Feeding, My sister was a single mom by choice. We both grew up in a loving, stable family and stayed close, even though we lived far apart. Unfortunately, the timing of our pregnancies and the pandemic meant that I never got to see her parenting her son (except over FaceTime). She died in a car accident when Silas was 2 and we adopted him. Once he made it through the grief and the transition, he was\u2014and is\u2014a sweet and friendly kid. His big sister, our bio-daughter, adores him. A few months ago, he fell at daycare and had to get X-rays. They showed healed breaks from the past that weren\u2019t in his medical records. I felt very weird about this. Then, last week, I took him to the dentist, who is a family friend. She pulled me aside to tell me that Silas\u2019s dental X-rays showed clear signs of a high fever that had gone untreated early in his life. Warping and mis-forming in molars, she said, can be a sign of early childhood medical neglect\u2014so she had to go through the mandated reporter process. Because of the adoption records, our interaction with CPS was perfunctory, but it was still horrifying. I\u2019m grappling with the idea that my sweet and loving sister abused her son. I\u2019m scared about what else might pop up, and how it could hurt him later on. I thought I knew my sister, and I feel so scared and angry and mixed up. My husband is in pain too for Silas, and neither of us knows what we should be doing. Up to now, I\u2019ve tried to keep the memory of his mother alive for him. How should we be talking to him about her if she harmed him? I\u2019d like to have the kids\u2019 pediatrician do a full exam in case there are other hidden health issues as a result of abuse, but I have no idea how to ask for that in a way that doesn\u2019t make it sound like I\u2019m trying to dodge abuse allegations. Should we put Silas in therapy, even though he seems fine right now? Is there something else we should or could be doing? \u2014Sad and Angry Dear Sad, I am so sorry\u2014this is an awful thing to have learned. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll likely never know the full truth about the first two years of your son\u2019s life\u2014or the full truth about your sister. But I do think you need to ask your pediatrician to do a prior-abuse screening, which will include a head ultrasound, an abdominal CT scan, and a scan for skeletal trauma beyond the presumably limited area of the X-rays already taken. The more information you have about Silas\u2019s early experiences, the more you\u2019ll be able to help him as time passes, as early trauma puts him at risk in various ways, not only now and in the near future but well into adulthood. I know this is a terrifying thing to contemplate, particularly as it cannot be completely separated from your shock and horror\u2014and confusion, and grief\u2014about your sister. But for Silas\u2019s sake, you must press on. Tell your pediatrician everything you\u2019ve told me. I doubt you\u2019ll need to explain why it\u2019s important for you to have a more complete picture of what your child may have experienced at the hands of his first mother (or, possibly, by others in her life), and/or the extent of the neglect he suffered. If the thought of talking to your current pediatrician about this makes you so uncomfortable or afraid you don\u2019t think you can do it, you need to change pediatricians. Their doctor should be someone you trust and feel at ease with, and with whom you can have a difficult conversation. As to psychotherapy for Silas: Don\u2019t wait until he doesn\u2019t seem fine. What you know about his early care (or lack of care) alone makes it important for him to have the widest net of support possible (even if he doesn\u2019t consciously remember anything about his life before the age of 2). Those first years of a child\u2019s life are crucial ones for development. Take the time to find the right therapist for him. You\u2019ll want to find someone who specializes in children Silas\u2019s age and who has training and experience treating children with a history of abuse/neglect in early childhood. You will also want it to be someone you find it easy to talk to, someone your instincts tell you is a good fit. And I know I always mention this when I talk about therapy for small children, but I urge you to find someone who is trained in play therapy. You\u2019ll get through this. Silas has you now\u2014he has you and your husband; he has a sister. He is surrounded by people who love him and who will take care of him. But if I may, I\u2019d like to make one more suggestion\u2014which is that you get help dealing with what you\u2019ve learned (and whatever else you may learn). You have a lot to process and try to make sense of. Don\u2019t neglect yourself while you move forward to do everything you can to help your child.

Dear Care and Feeding, I\u2019ve gotten the \u201cick\u201d about the mother of one of my 10-year-old daughter\u2019s friends, and it\u2019s made me not want to trust her with my daughter\u2019s care anymore. The woman is very sweet and caring and I felt only sympathy when she recently lost her job and her marriage broke up (her husband then moved far away for a job, though he returns each month to see his daughter). For more than a year, she\u2019s told my wife that the handsome father of another classmate is about to leave his wife, though to all appearances that couple is solid. I raised my eyebrows about these constant reports of an impending breakup that never happened, but it didn\u2019t worry me. My discomfort arose when we were recently talking about the war in Ukraine. She has Eastern European roots, though from a country not traditionally friendly to Russia. She revealed herself to be pro-Putin and wouldn\u2019t even agree with me that it would be better for Russia to be a democracy. My wife wasn\u2019t too bothered by this but to me it was a \u201cwhat\u2019s up with this person\u201d tipping point. It revealed values that are just too hard for me to understand, and a character that\u2019s got more going on than her sweetness suggests. Now my wife and daughter are mad at me that I don\u2019t feel comfortable about my daughter going to her house for a sleepover. I don\u2019t know if my ick is rational, but it\u2019s not going away. \u2014The Ick is Real Dear Ick, It\u2019s your ick, not your kid\u2019s. Unless you have reason to believe that her pro-Putin stance puts your 10-year-old at risk, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to forbid sleepovers at her house. (If I\u2019d applied the political purity test to the parents of all my daughter\u2019s friends throughout her childhood, I\u2019m not sure she would have had any friends.) If you don\u2019t want your kid to be indoctrinated (and who does?), just make sure she knows you disagree vehemently with her friend\u2019s mom and why. But I doubt very much that this woman you dislike is going to talk politics to the kids or that they\u2019d pay any attention to it if she did. Or are you assuming that her political beliefs (as well as all the other things that didn\u2019t bother you before) mean she can\u2019t be trusted to house and feed your daughter overnight? I don\u2019t see why. And I don\u2019t see why your \u201cick\u201d\u2014rational or not\u2014should affect your daughter. Let her play. Think of it as practice for when she\u2019s a teenager and young adult and you don\u2019t like her choice of friends or romantic partners. Your ick is irrelevant. Dear Care and Feeding, Last year, my niece came on the monthlong road trip my family took. Her mom had just died and I thought it would be a distraction for her. She is the same age as my daughter and the girls are very close. The trip was good for her, and she has spent a lot of time with us over the course of the year. Living full-time with my brother and her stepfamily hasn\u2019t been easy for her. Among other things, she hasn\u2019t been doing well in school since her mother\u2019s death. My brother and his wife are having a lot of issues, and I don\u2019t think the marriage is going to survive. I thought it would be good (not just for my niece\u2014and my daughter\u2014but for my brother and his wife too) to get her out of their house this summer. We\u2019re driving cross country country to visit my in-laws, and I\u2019ve offered to take her along. Here is where my sister-in-law stuck her nose in. She is offended that we have never offered to take her two kids on any of these trips\u2014just my niece. But the thing is, her kids are fine when she is there to supervise them, but are completely out of control once her back is turned. The few times we have babysat them were exhausting. I shudder in horror at the thought of traveling cross country in an RV with them, especially with the younger one constantly wandering off without a care. So I told my brother that five kids was too much for my wife and me to handle. He has been wavering back and forth about allowing my niece to come with us. How do I convince him? My sister-in-law usually rules the roost and has always had a chip on her shoulder. I just never thought she would be this petty, and punish my niece over it. \u2014Uncle in Arizona Dear Uncle, If your sister-in-law has decreed that her stepdaughter can\u2019t go unless her non-step two kids (your brother\u2019s stepchildren, I assume, and not his children with her?) get to go too, I agree that she\u2019s being willfully hard-hearted, even cruel. Your niece has lost her mother; the other children haven\u2019t. This isn\u2019t unfair \u201cspecial treatment\u201d; it\u2019s a kind and loving gesture from a devoted uncle and aunt. But \u2026 well, a couple of things. You haven\u2019t said that your sister-in-law made this decree (only that your brother seems to have decided that it may come down to that). And you say that she\u2019s angry that you \u201chave never offered to take her two kids on any of these trips\u201d [emphasis my own], which makes me wonder if the practice of inviting your niece and not her siblings, to whom you don\u2019t consider yourself related, long predates the death of your brother\u2019s former wife\u2014in which case it may be that your brother\u2019s current wife feels that you have never fully welcomed her into the family. And I think that may be true. The fact is, if these younger kids are your brother\u2019s children\u2014step or otherwise\u2014they are part of your extended family, but you don\u2019t refer to them as such. I certainly get the sense that you don\u2019t much like their mother, or at least not as much as you liked the woman your brother used to be married to. Now, I don\u2019t know the backstory here (I bet it\u2019s complicated!), and you are under no obligation to love your brother\u2019s current wife, but it does behoove you to treat her respectfully (bonus point for compassionately). So when you talk to your brother\u2014which you should, because I am absolutely in favor of your taking your niece along on this trip, and I do want to help you convince him to let her go\u2014don\u2019t be stingy with your empathy. Especially if you have slighted these other children over the years, but even if you haven\u2019t. Tell your brother you understand how his wife feels. But remind him that his daughter is grieving; that she has lost her mother, which is one of the worst things that can happen to a child; that you and your wife want only to offer her support and love. You\u2019re not excluding his other children from a fun vacation this summer; you\u2019re actively trying to help one of his children during an extraordinarily difficult period. If that doesn\u2019t convince him, then there is way more going on in the family dynamic than you\u2019ve let me in on. \u2014Michelle More Advice From Slate I messed up. My 4-year-old loves the scary displays at the mall, so I took him to a haunted house that I thought was kid-friendly but was less David S. Pumpkins and more Saw.

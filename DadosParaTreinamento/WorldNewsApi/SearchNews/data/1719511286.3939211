Here's how But Busey claims she has a \u201cverbal lease\u201d with the homeowner\u2019s granddaughter to live in the Lakewood home rent-free. She also disputes any allegations of lawlessness brought forward by her neighbors. She told NBC\u2019s 9NEWS the spoken agreement with the granddaughter allows her to live in the home on the condition that she makes home improvements and will eventually buy the property. \u201cI get here and I make it look nice and all of the sudden they want me out,\u201d Busey said, adding that she will fight for the home until she is legally forced out. Here\u2019s why this case is such \u201ca mess,\u201d to cite a local legal expert. A 'verbal lease' Verbal leases of one year or less are legally binding in Colorado, but they are rarely a good idea. Without a written contract, any disputes that occur will be one person\u2019s word against the other. Busey claims the former homeowner\u2019s granddaughter gave her the verbal go-ahead to live in the home rent-free. But police and court records obtained by 9NEWS describe the granddaughter as a \u201cvulnerable adult\u201d who lives in a facility for people with developmental disabilities, and she may not have the mental capacity to make reasonable decisions. If there\u2019s a dispute about a verbal lease in Colorado, success typically comes down to the credibility of the parties involved, according to 9NEWS legal expert Whitney Traylor.

Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds In this case, Busey\u2019s past brushes with the law, which include at least two felony convictions for identity theft \u2014 plus the fact that neighbors have called the cops at least 19 times with complaints \u2014 do not work in her favor. Busey says \u201cthere has been no criminal activity\u201d at the house and is disputing the legal action against her. When asked directly by 9NEWS if she is \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of the former owner\u2019s granddaughter, Busey replied: \u201cAbsolutely not. I offered to buy the house.\u201d Dying without a will The Busey case has \u201cso much to unravel,\u201d Traylor says. \u201cThe primary issue is that the decedent who owned the property died without a will.\u201d If you die without a will in Colorado, your assets are distributed to your closest relatives under the state\u2019s intestate succession laws. In that case, the owner\u2019s granddaughter may be the rightful heir to the property. Only assets that pass through probate \u2014 including property titled solely in the name of the person who died \u2014 are affected by intestate succession laws. Assets that don\u2019t pass through probate \u2014 which includes anything with beneficiaries listed, such as life insurance, retirement accounts and certain bank accounts \u2014 will pass onto any surviving co-owners or named beneficiaries regardless of the existence of a will. 9NEWS reviewed probate court records of the contested home, which show that the court system in Jefferson County appointed a special administrator to sort out who should inherit the property. The local news station also reports the administrator was asked to \u201caddress the issues that have arisen\u201d after the grandfather\u2019s death, which may involve \u201cillegal activity, squatters living at the property and probably drug use.\u201d What to read next Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof \u2014 and only getting worse.

The \u201cG\u201d in ESG \u2013 \u201cGovernance\u201d \u2013 is used to establish and ingrain far-left woke ideology in American business, resulting in sometimes absurd decision making. Daniel Cameron, CEO of the 1792 Exchange, explains how it works in an interview with Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow. The 1792 Exchange exposes coercion and ideological bias in corporations and works to get America\u2019s businesses back to business. Marlow notes that the \u201cG\u201d in ESG (which stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance) \u201cis how corporations are now guiding themselves, how their leadership teams are guiding them in order to not optimize profit [or] maximize the success of the business, but to enforce wokeness at a level that\u2019s institutional.\u201d \u201cHow did we get here and why is this maybe the biggest threat of all of them to these corporations?\u201d Marlow asks Cameron. Cameron explains that through Governance, an organization implements various training programs to indoctrinate every single employee. He thinks it can be the most harmful component of ESG. \u201cIf you think about sort of 1984, the [George Orwell] book that in many ways captures this idea of the thought police, of Big Brother,\u201d Cameron says. \u201cThis is Big Brother inside of corporations, telling people how to think how to speak and ultimately to not express their First Amendment rights. It\u2019s placing limitations on the ability of people to have different thought processes. They want everybody essentially inside a corporation to be a drone when it comes to specific issues.\u201d What\u2019s the impact of woke \u201cGovernance?\u201d Part of the woke agenda is to move away from merit-based hiring, promotion, and compensation for employees. \u201cThose shouldn\u2019t be things that are subjected to the far-eft ideology or woke policies or woke agendas,\u201d says Cameron. \u201cIt should be based upon merit and pay structures, and compensation shouldn\u2019t be based on diversity, equity, and inclusion [DEI] as sort of the governance component of ESG\u2026. It should be about making assessments on whether a C-suite executive or other leadership in a company are returning the investment and maximizing the investment to these corporations.\u201d Marlow comments that \u201cC-suite executives now are incentivized in some cases not to turn a major profit or to have the stock grow exponentially, but to have a diversity quota hit in their hiring,\u201d meaning that executives are less focused on their company\u2019s balance sheet because they \u201cget a bonus\u201d for meeting woke hiring quotas rather than \u201cmaking money for the corporation.\u201d \u201cHow is this even possible and can we undo it? Are there any instances where this has been undone?\u201d Alex asks. Cameron cites Starbucks as a recent example of the \u201cundoing,\u201d noting that \u201cStarbucks had fallen in to this this Governance model, where they were tying bonuses to diversity quotas. Well, they\u2019ve moved away from that and have now more general targets based on workforce as opposed to identity specifically. I think that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d As for solutions, Cameron says that 1792 Exchange is \u201cabout moving corporations back to neutral\u201d by equipping people with information through the 1792 Exchange\u2018s Corporate Bias Ratings, Proxy Database, and Board Bias Database. The 1792 Exchange\u2018s databases provide people \u201cthe knowledge to push back against corporations, to ask thoughtful questions as it relates to shareholder meetings, and to challenge some of this woke ideology that\u2019s trying to make its way into our companies,\u201d Cameron says. \u201cAnd that is better for America, that is better for the profits of businesses, that is better for the shareholders, and that\u2019s where we need to go.\u201d \u201c1792 exchange.com.

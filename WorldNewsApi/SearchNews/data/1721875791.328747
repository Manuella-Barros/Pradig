{"id": 239738446, "title": "'I will bring back Boris Johnson', pledges Robert Jenrick - as he reveals his Tory leadership pitch...", "text": "One of the favourites to succeed Rishi Sunak as Tory leader became the first out of the traps for the post-election contest last night by effectively setting out his manifesto in The Mail on Sunday. Former immigration minister Robert Jenrick heaped praise on Nigel Farage and called for Boris Johnson to return to a prominent role, as he called for a re-booted Tory party to devise radical policies to bring estranged Conservative voters back into the fold \u2013 with dramatic cuts to immigration being top of the list. If he keeps his Newark seat, Mr Jenrick is likely to compete with Priti Patel, Kemi Badenoch and Tom Tugendhat in a leadership battle after the election on July 4. He said: 'We have to build a coalition of voters and propose policies which will fix people's problems \u2013 be that on migration, public services reform, the cost of living, or housing.' Mr Jenrick adds: 'I know Boris Johnson has been supporting Tory colleagues ahead of polling day. He will always have a special place in our party and country's history as the leader who got Brexit done. 'He is also, of course, a one-of-a-kind campaigner. He must always have a place in the Conservative Party, including in Parliament, if he ever wishes to have one.' In his MoS interview today, Mr Farage says he would be prepared to work with Mr Jenrick, adding: 'I like a lot of what he says.' A source close to Mr Jenrick said that he disagreed with Mr Farage over his views on Vladimir Putin, but respected the Reform leader for the way in which he had fought against rising immigration.", "summary": "Former immigration minister Robert Jenrick heaped praise on Nigel Farage and called for Boris Johnson to return, as he called for a re-booted Tory party.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13559125/Boris-Johnson-Robert-Jenrick-Tory-leadership-pitch.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/23/01/86458205-0-image-m-106_1719102950239.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 00:46:35", "author": "Editor,Glen Owen", "authors": ["Editor", "Glen Owen"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.047}

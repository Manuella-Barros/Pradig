The royal trip saw the Duchess of Sussex making frequent outfit changes on the trip with her husband Prince Harry, with her fashion choices seemingly offending the First Lady. At an event celebrating President Bola Tinubu's first year in office, Tinubu gave a speech addressing, among other things, the significant contributions women have made to society and appeared to make a discreet dig towards the former Suits actress, the Mirror reports. While addressing the audience, she stressed: \"The message here is we have to salvage our children. We see the way they dress. \"They keep forgetting that Nigeria, we are beautiful. You can see what they showcase on the stage, I said, 'We are fashionable, we see what is going on'. \"We are not having the Met Gala. And everyone, the nakedness, is just everywhere and the men are well-clothed. So we have to do something. Tell them we don't accept nakedness in our culture. That is not beautiful. It's not beautiful at all.\" She continued: \"And they're all beautiful girls, but they should be confident in who they are. They do not want to mimic and try to emulate film stars from America. \"They don't know where they come from. Why did Meghan come here looking for Africa? That is something we have to take home with. We know who we are. Don't lose who you are.\" A snippet of the speech has been circulated on X, previously known as Twitter, with one user commenting: \"Meghan Markle managed to create an international incident! We warned her about the clothes.\" Another concurred: \"I agree with the First Lady.\" A third wrote: \"She should really respect other people culture and should apologise to the country.\" However, some were not convinced the First Lady was actually directly criticising the Duchess of Sussex. One user wrote: \"The message is not for her. Stop giving yourself a headache because of her,\" while another added: \"She's talking about Nigerian girls dressing like the Kardashians. \"She even said look at Meghan that came here, implying even M was interested in the country. She was talking in praise. Letting girls know they can be proud of their country. Stop twisting her words.\" During her visit to Nigeria, Meghan sported a variety of outfits and accessories, splurging nearly \u00a3120,000 on jewellery and new attire. She donned several high-end brands during the trip, including Carolina Herrera, Altuzarra, and Johanna Ortiz. The decision has been met with backlash considering the severe poverty levels in Nigeria, where over 112 million individuals live in destitution. The disparity is not due to a scarcity of resources, as Nigeria boasts the largest economy in Africa, but rather because those in power are disconnected from the hardships of ordinary people. The impoverishment in Nigeria stems from the mismanagement of resources, with political corruption exacerbating the difficulties. To illustrate the extent of poverty in Nigeria, the annual earnings of the wealthiest Nigerian man from his fortune could potentially lift 2 million people out of poverty.

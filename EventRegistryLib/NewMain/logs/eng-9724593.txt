Perry tragically died in October 2023 when he was found unresponsive at his Los Angeles home. It was later confirmed that his death was caused by the effects of ketamine. Currently, an investigation into how the actor got his hands on the drug is underway, and Charlie Sheen's ex-wife, Brooke Mueller, has been questioned in connection.\n\nAccording to In Touch Weekly, stars Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, and David Schwimmer are now trying to figure out how they will commemorate the huge Friends anniversary while also honoring Matthew Perry. The cast is said to be unsure of their plans. However, they feel like it's important to carry out a celebration, as Perry was \"hyped up\" about it.\n\n\"They're still reeling from the loss of Matthew, so on one hand, the idea of celebrating this anniversary without him is beyond painful,\" an insider tells the outlet. \"Especially as there will inevitably be questions about his death, especially with this whole investigation now making headlines.\"\n\nIt seems that the Friends cast will never do an official reunion or sitdown like the one that aired on HBO Max in 2021. Especially now that Perry has passed away. However, they do have some ideas of how to mark the occasion. They don't want a huge spotlight, but they could decide to appear on a talk show together. However, they might decide that a private celebration would be more fitting.\n\n\"[Matthew] had so many ideas about what they should do, so to now go ahead without him is almost too painful for words,\" the source continued. \"But at the same time, they do feel it's important to mark the anniversary somehow and right now they're in talks to figure out how to do just that with less fanfare.\"\n\nThe insider also added that the cast has an \"unbreakable bond\" that was \"intensified\" following Matthew Perry's death. They're like family to one another, and to lose their close friend has been emotional for them.\n\nFans would certainly love to see any sort of Friends reunion. However, it's understandable that Matthew Perry's death has been hard for those closest to him.

Documents reveal the amount of money Matthew Perry had in his bank account on the day of his death\n\nThe ones who have taken Matthew Perry's death the hardest has been the entire cast of 'Friends', they are still struggling to accept how Matthew passed away as the police investigation into his passing remains a mystery. His co-stars are determined to make Perry's legacy carry on after him as the show's 30th anniversary approaches. According to a recent report from Radar Online, the surviving cast members are starting to have their own reservations about the event that would celebrate the show's anniversary and the ife of Matthew Perry. According to this report, most of the cast members don't think making a celebration amid the recent discoveries of the actor's last days is a good idea. It's entirely possible we don't get a celebration at all.\n\nWhen Matthew Perry's unresponsive body was found on October 28 last year, the toxicology report revealed that the actor had copious amounts of ketamine in his system. But recent investigations have officials on a mission to find out where Matthew Perry got aht extremely high dose and are currently questioning 'key' Hollywood figures who are known drug abusers. An investigation that has everybody in town talking about Matthew again and celebrating the show's anniversary will be far more painful to his loved ones, considering the circumstances. According to people close to him, they say Perry was thrilled to celebrate the show's 30th anniversary before his untimely passing.\n\nDepending on how the investigation into Matthew Perry's death goes, there is a good possibility we may find a guilty party in all of this who can be convicted for murder. Most of the people who love Matthew are still waiting to see where this investigation leads and if they will know the truth about what happened to the actor. But the celebration is not 100% cancelled, as the surviving cast is still in talks to see if there is a way to honor Matthew's legacy with class and in spite of the circumstances. It's been a rough last year for everybody who loved Perry as Chandler Bing in 'Friends'.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Perry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Perry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mystery film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_Online", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radar Online"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toxicology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ketamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_Bing", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chandler Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/b86641524da4f192d9596b4d9e477194/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/07/11/17207088631934.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724593", "eventUri": "eng-9724593", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-28", "textStart": 920, "textEnd": 930}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

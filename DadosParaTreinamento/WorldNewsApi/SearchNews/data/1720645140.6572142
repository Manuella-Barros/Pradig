This achievement surpasses that of his father-in-law and TDP founder, NT Rama Rao, who served three terms in the erstwhile united Andhra Pradesh.TDP achieved an impressive victory in the state's Lok Sabha polls, securing 16 seats and establishing itself as a crucial ally of the NDA.In 1996, after the BJP was invited to form the government, Chandrababu Naidu became the convenor of the United Front, which governed the Centre from 1996-98 with the outside support of the Congress, following Vajpayee's resignation after a 13-day stint. In mid-April 1997, when the Congress withdrew its support from the UF government led by then Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda, Naidu played a crucial role in the selection of the next Prime Minister. Now, 27 years later, as the election results poured in on Tuesday, it became evident that Naidu, at the age of 74, has returned to his role as a kingmaker. The TDP has emerged as the second-largest party in the NDA, securing 16 Lok Sabha seats in Andhra Pradesh. This outcome means that while the BJP requires Naidu's support at the Centre, he does not need them in the state, solidifying his position as a kingmaker.(With inputs from agencies)", "summary": "", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/n-chandrababu-naidu-to-take-oath-as-andhra-pradesh-cm-on-june-12-at-9-27am/articleshow/110824796.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-110824860/110824860.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:01:02", "author": "TIMESOFINDIA.COM", "authors": ["TIMESOFINDIA.COM"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "IN", "sentiment": 0.041}

I strongly condemn the violent response against peaceful protesters.\"\n\nShe made the statement in response to a post shared by Amnesty International on X. Amnesty International expressed concern over the \"use of unlawful and unnecessary force\" against the participants of the Baloch National Gathering by security forces.\n\nIt called on Pakistani authorities to immediately lift the internet shutdown in Pakistan and fulfil its obligations under domestic and international human rights law to facilitate people's right to peaceful protest by lifting the road blockades placed on the way to Gwadar.\n\nIn a post on X, Amnesty International South Asia, Regional Office stated, \"Pakistan : @amnesty is alarmed at the use of unlawful and unnecessary force against the participants of the Baloch National Gathering by security forces yesterday. It is a blatant violation of people's right to freedom of peaceful assembly.\"\n\n\"On 27 June, Frontier Corps reportedly fired on unarmed and peaceful protestors in Mustang, Balochistan, resulting in 14 injuries, several among them serious. A complete internet shutdown has also been imposed in Gwadar, hindering the flow of information in and outside the region. Amnesty International calls on the Pakistan authorities to immediately lift the internet shutdown in Balochistan, and fulfil its obligations under domestic and international human rights law to facilitate people's right to peaceful protest by lifting the road blockades on the way to Gwadar to allow freedom of movement for protestors,\" it added.\n\nThe statements by Amnesty International and Malala Yousufzai came after Pakistani security forces reportedly took severe action against participants of a Baloch national gathering. The recent crackdown has sparked significant backlash amid fears that these measures might exacerbate rather than alleviate the underlying problems.\n\nThe Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) accused Pakistani security forces of launching a \"brutal and violent attack\" on the Baloch National Gathering sit-in, which resulted in the arrest of more than 200 people.\n\nIn a post on X, Baloch Yakjehti Committee stated, \"On the morning of July 29, the Pakistani security forces launched a brutal and violent attack on the Baloch National Gathering peaceful sit-in, resulting in numerous injuries and the arrest of over 200 individuals. We still have no information of their whereabouts.\"\n\n\"Despite the incident, Baloch Yakjehti Committee activists, with the strength and support of the public, have resumed the sit-in, which continues today on its third day. Even now, police and Frontier Corps (FC) surround the sit-in area and are continuously harassing the peaceful participants,\" it added.\n\nIn another post on X, the BYC stated that protests erupted across Balochistan in response to the violent attacks on the peaceful Baloch National Gathering.\n\nTaking to X, BYC stated, \"In response to the violent attacks on the peaceful #BalochNationalGathering, demonstrations erupted throughout Balochistan. Today, people in large numbers are observing protests and shutter-down strikes in Kahran, Kalat, Dalbandin and other places, in solidarity with the victims of state brutality, who lost their lives, and marched bravely in front of bullets, with their heads held high.\"\n\nThis crackdown has drawn substantial criticism amid concerns that such actions could escalate rather than resolve the underlying issues.\n\nThe Baloch community continues to endure severe human rights abuses, particularly enforced disappearances where individuals are abducted by state or affiliated forces without legal recourse, causing profound anguish for their families and often resulting in severe torture.\n\nThe situation is compounded by extrajudicial killings targeting activists and critics without due process, instilling widespread fear and stifling dissent.

Despite roadblocks put in place by the authorities, a large number of people managed to make their way from across the province to Gwadar's Marine Drive for the Baloch Raji Muchi (Baloch national gathering).\n\nOn Monday, the military said a soldier was martyred and 16 other security personnel, including an officer, were injured in firing by \"an unruly mob\" in Gwadar during clashes between the forces and supporters of the BYC. On the other hand, BYC leader Dr Mahrang Baloch claimed hundreds of their supporters had been arrested over the past two days.\n\nAccording to the latest reports emerging from the area, which is under a road and communications blockade, participants of the Baloch Raji Muchi are still present in Gwadar.\n\nSecurity forces launched a crackdown after the clashes to disperse the participants of a sit-in organised by the BYC on Marine Drive, officials had said. The local administration had claimed that the situation was becoming normal, adding that police had arrested over two dozen protesters during the crackdown against the participants of the sit-in which began on Sunday evening after the end of the Baloch Raji Muchi.\n\nEarlier today, the BYC alleged that in Monday's \" violent crackdown\", the Counter-Terrorism Department had \"forcibly abducted BYC leaders along with other participants\".\n\nIt added that \"those abducted include Sammi Deen Baloch, Dr Sabiha Baloch and Sibghat Abdul Haq Baloch. Their abduction was witnessed by thousands of peaceful protestors. Before abducting them, the forces beat and tortured them, then dragged them to their vehicles.

The anger fuelled separatist sentiments, with the province witnessing at least five rebellion movements since the formation of Pakistan in 1947.\n\nThe latest wave of rebellion began in the early 2000s to demand a larger share of the province's resources and even calls for complete independence. The Pakistani security forces have since launched a severe crackdown on the rebellion, killing thousands of people in the last two decades.\n\nGwadar, due to its economic prominence, has been a hotbed of violence by armed and separatist groups, the latest being in March this year, when eight men tried to enter the Gwadar Port Authority complex before they were killed by security officials.\n\nOn Sunday, the BYC called for a \"Baloch Rajee Muchi\", or Baloch National Gathering, in Gwadar. However, as convoys from different parts of the vast province made their way to the city, law enforcement officials started blocking major highways that lead there, resulting in clashes in some places.\n\nThe BYC claims security forces opened fire during one such clash on Saturday in Mastung district, killing one person and wounding several others.\n\n\"The paramilitary force opened fire on a convoy comprising hundreds of people, including women and children, who were travelling from Quetta to Gwadar,\" BYC representative Bebarg Baloch told Al Jazeera.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, the Pakistani military said one of its soldiers was also killed in the \"unprovoked attacks by a violent mob\" and 16 other soldiers were injured.\n\nDozens of Baloch were arrested by security forces during the clashes as mobile and internet services were suspended in Gwadar - as they have been for a fourth consecutive day as of Tuesday.\n\nThe BYC said two of their prominent leaders, Sammi Deen Baloch and Sabiha Baloch, were picked up by the authorities in Gwadar on Monday and their whereabouts are unknown.\n\nAngry protesters gathered in other towns in the province as well, including provincial capital Quetta, Kech and Mastung to demand their release.\n\nMeanwhile, BYC leader Mahrang Baloch issued a statement late on Sunday night, outlining two main demands: the opening of highways to allow the Baloch protesters to reach Gwadar, and the release of dozens of their members arrested by law enforcement agencies since last week.\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of hundreds in Gwadar that night, Mahrang, 31, said the people of Gwadar had come out in large numbers to resist \"state oppression\".\n\n\"The state and its institutions have attempted to prevent us from holding this gathering by blocking highways and arresting our people, but today the entire Gwadar is here to send a message: we will not tolerate further oppression of the Baloch nation,\" she said.\n\n\"I know I may be the next target of this state, but unity is our strength, and we must remain united.\"\n\nBYC member Sadia Baloch told Al Jazeera from Quetta on Tuesday that they will continue to protest until all those arrested are released.\n\n\"We have thousands of people protesting all over in Balochistan who were stopped by authorities from travelling to Gwadar,\" she told Al Jazeera. \"Sammi and Sabiha were picked up from a sit-in and we don't know where they are. Nobody from local authorities is giving a response.\"\n\nAl Jazeera reached out to local authorities and government officials in Gwadar and Quetta, but did not get any response.\n\nBalochistan's Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Monday slammed the protests.\n\n\"We were offering them space to hold a rally elsewhere, but they refused and remained adamant to hold it in Gwadar. The purpose behind this chaos is to sabotage all the development and progress that the province has seen,\" he said from inside the state assembly.\n\nBugti said that while the citizens have a right to assemble, they should not have the \"intentions to disrupt peace and order\".\n\nBut rights group Amnesty International on Tuesday accused the authorities of trying to \"vilify and criminalise peaceful protesters\".\n\n\"Every time Baloch protests take place, their demands are met with violence by security forces and mass arrests,\" it said in a statement shared with Al Jazeera, demanding that \"repeated punitive crackdowns\" on Baloch protests must end.\n\n\"Amnesty International calls for an end to the brutal crackdown on the Baloch protests and the immediate and unconditional release of all those arrested for exercising their right of peaceful assembly,\" it said.\n\nThe Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) also criticised the \"unnecessary\" use of force against Baloch protesters and the suspension of internet and mobile services.\n\n\"They should constitute a high-level parliamentary delegation to meet with Baloch representatives and listen carefully to their demands,\" it said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abid_hussain@aljazeera.com", "name": "Abid

The BYC is a prominent civil rights movement advocating for the protection of civil, political, and economic rights, and calling for an end to enforced disappearances and custodial killings of Baloch in Balochistan.\n\nOn July 27, the Frontier Corps, a paramilitary force in Pakistan, opened fire on buses heading to Gwadar for the Baloch National Gathering, injuring at least 14 people in Mastung, about 60 km (35 miles) west of Quetta. The authorities set up blockades across the province to restrict movement, leading to further violence.\n\nThe crackdown intensified on July 28, with security forces killing at least three protesters in Gwadar and injuring dozens more. On July 29, police used tear gas to disperse demonstrators, with reports of security forces firing on protesters on the outskirts of Gwadar on July 30.\n\nSince July 27, the Balochistan government has blocked roads and highways and cut off internet access, isolating Gwadar - a city once hailed for its potential as an emerging port similar to Dubai. Now, it stands as a bone of contention between ethnic Baloch, the federal government of Pakistan, and Beijing.\n\nIn this impoverished, dusty coastal town, which serves as a hub for the much discussed China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, China has invested a considerable amount in infrastructure and development, bringing the town into the limelight. Still, the indigenous residents of Gwadar and ethnic Baloch complain that their resources are being plundered with little benefit to them.\n\nThe Baloch have engaged in peaceful political activism against both Islamabad and China, while insurgents have also targeted Chinese interests with violent attacks. The ongoing unrest casts a shadow over the town's future and raises concerns about its stability and the viability of Chinese investment.\n\nIn recent years, China has faced significant security challenges in Pakistan, with insurgents and Islamist militants frequently attacking Chinese workers, and the general public appearing increasingly unhappy with Chinese investment. Since 2021, Gwadar has seen multiple large-scale protests, with residents voicing grievances about being deprived of basic civic rights and necessities of life, despite the launch of CPEC almost a decade ago.\n\nDespite promises and grand claims that Gwadar would transform into a city akin to Shenzhen, Singapore, or Dubai, the reality remains starkly different. Today, Gwadar is still heavily dependent on neighboring Iran for electricity, while its nearly 100,000 residents rely on natural sources such as rain and traditional dams for water.\n\nIn recent months, the Baloch Yakjehti Committee has emerged as a harsh critic of Chinese investment in Gwadar. The BYC is an influential and popular group in Balochistan, largely due to its peaceful struggle for Baloch rights. It vocally addresses human rights issues plaguing Balochistan, especially enforced disappearances, custodial killings, and the exploitation of Balochistan's resources. The BYC's agenda resonates deeply with the Baloch public, which is why the group has earned considerable trust in Balochistan in a remarkably short time.\n\nThe BYC's main demand is an end to so-called enforced disappearances in Balochistan, which the group's leadership rightly calls illegal and unconstitutional. The BYC leadership has repeatedly emphasized that people suspected of unlawful activities should face due process in a court of law under the constitution of Pakistan instead of being disappeared or killed.\n\nThe Balochistan government's violent response to peaceful protesters last week not only violated articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which guarantee freedom of movement and the right to assemble peacefully, but also represents a failure on the government's part to engage with one of the most popular peaceful rights movements in Balochistan.\n\nBalochistan has been hard hit by a violent separatist insurgency for the last two decades, the longest and most violent episode in the region's history compared to the previous four insurgencies. The economic and social reforms undertaken in the early 1970s by Pakistan's former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto should have served as a roadmap for containing the current insurgency in Balochistan. Instead, Pakistani rulers have embarked on even more political adventures, including forcefully disappearing political activists, banning political parties, and cracking down on peaceful rights movements.\n\nIn recent times, a popular peaceful rights movement in the form of the BYC has gained the trust and attention of not only the Baloch population - from Balochistan to Karachi and Dera Ghazi Khan in southern Punjab, where a huge population of Baloch lives - but also other political stakeholders in Balochistan, regardless of their stance on Pakistan's parliamentary politics. Both hardline nationalists who reject Pakistan's parliamentary politics and political parties in Balochistan deeply respect the BYC because of its considerable public support. However, the state's attitude toward the BYC seems hostile.\n\nBYC is highly regarded by the masses because it speaks about their genuine issues, particularly enforced disappearances that have plagued Balochistan for two decades. The failure of various governments to resolve these issues has deepened mistrust between the center and Baloch youth. This erosion of confidence in Baloch parliamentary parties has led the public to support alternate voices like the BYC, which has refrained from participating in elections or joining assemblies in Pakistan.\n\nDespite this, the BYC has been attempting to find solutions within the framework of the constitution of Pakistan. For this reason, the group organized a month-long sit-in in Islamabad from December to January, where they were also mistreated. The abuse of Baloch women and elders by Islamabad police conveyed a disappointing and negative message, and likely served as motivation for later violent attacks in Balochistan.\n\nAnother reason the BYC has gained public trust, especially among young Baloch women, is its indirect fight against patriarchy and gender inequality, which are deeply rooted in Baloch society. For the first time, a peaceful rights movement is led by young women, who make up the majority of BYC supporters. These young women have challenged the cultural status quo and outdated traditions, as well as the power corridors in Pakistan. They have inspired ordinary Baloch by removing the fear that has long held them back.\n\nMovements like the BYC are rare in the region, particularly because women are at the forefront. Many of these young women are driven by personal victimization; for instance, BYC organizer Dr. Mahrang Baloch, a general surgeon, lost her father to enforced disappearance. Her personal experience and commitment to the cause resonate deeply with ordinary Baloch.\n\nEngaging leaders like Mahrang Baloch and having a political dialogue with the BYC represented a crucial opportunity for Pakistan's political and military leadership, which has long dreamed of talking to Baloch nationalists to find a solution to Balochistan's conundrum. However, due to a lack of political seriousness in Balochistan, this opportunity has been nearly missed.\n\nThe provincial government of Balochistan likely missed this chance deliberately, as the current government representatives in Balochistan do not believe in political dialogue. Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti, a staunch supporter of the powerful military and Pakistan's former caretaker interior minister just before the elections, was brought into power through what many see as hijacked elections. This process was widely viewed as a violation of democratic principles and Pakistan's election rules. His and his administration's reliance on violence to address public grievances and maintain power has led some to describe them as artificial leaders, having used coercion rather than democratic processes to secure their positions.\n\nThe state's harsh treatment of the BYC last week has only reinforced the narrative that peaceful activism has no place in Balochistan. This will ultimately benefit the Baloch separatist insurgents, who have long said that peaceful activism is futile in Pakistan. By using force against a peaceful movement with large public support, the Pakistani government risks driving more Baloch youth toward a violent insurgency.", "source": {"uri": "thediplomat.com",

The past few days alone have brought tensions in the troubled region to a head. The brute force used by the authorities to stop a peaceful protest rally has inflamed an already volatile situation. The province stands dangerously polarised. Yet, those in power seem to have no realisation of the gravity of the situation.\n\nThousands of people from across the province have gathered in Gwadar, protesting not only against enforced disappearances but also for their democratic rights. A number of people, including security personnel, have reportedly been killed or injured in the clashes. Scores of marchers have been detained and roadblocks placed in many parts.\n\nAll the administration's efforts, however, have failed to stop the rally which has been organised by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee and is supported by some Baloch nationalist parties. It was not the first such protest against enforced disappearances in the province and outside, but it has certainly been the most consequential in recent years. Led by Mahrang Baloch, the young firebrand medical doctor, the BYC has emerged as the most powerful voice against state oppression.\n\nAngry protesters have brought life to a halt in all major towns in southern Balochistan, which has become the centre of discontent. The use of violence by the administration and roadblocks to stop the march have further infuriated the public. Anti-establishment protests have spread to a large part of the province. They reflect the growing alienation of the Baloch population, which has long been deprived of its fundamental rights.\n\nA large number of the demonstrators are women, whose family members have either been missing for years or have been killed, their cruelly tortured bodies found dumped. It is alleged that they had been picked up by security personnel.\n\nAngry protesters have brought life to a halt in all major towns in southern Balochistan.\n\nMahrang Baloch herself has experienced this. Her father was abducted in 2009 and his tortured remains were recovered in 2011. These events propelled her to become an activist for the Baloch.\n\nThe persecution of male political activists has forced their women relatives to take to the streets and lead the movement. The number of enforced disappearances and incidents of judicial killings have increased, with the state facing growing separatist militancy. The main objective of the peaceful protest is to draw attention to the plight of the hapless population.\n\nUnfortunately, their cries for justice have fallen on deaf ears; the authorities, instead of assuaging their woes, are stifling the protesters' voices. We hear the same old mantra of anti-state elements being behind the protests. There is no realisation of the widening divide between the Baloch people and the state. The people have no trust in the manipulated political system imposed on the province through rigged elections. The authority of the state is now being increasingly challenged by people's power in retaliation to the suppression of the democratic process.\n\nBalochistan has witnessed a low-intensity conflict for several years now, with the latest phase beginning some two decades back after relative peace from 1980 to 1988 -- the latter was the year that civilian rule was restored after the Zia era, and Baloch nationalists began to be reintegrated into the political mainstream. But that uneasy calm ended when, during Gen Musharraf's rule, the tribal chief Nawab Akbar Bugti was killed in an army operation in 2006. Simmering discontent once again spilled over as fresh hostilities began. Instead of finding a political solution to end the growing public discontent, the state adopted the kinetic option.\n\nBaloch grievances are very real and of long standing. Yet force has been used to crush the people's voice. Despite its natural wealth, the province is the most underdeveloped region in Pakistan, and is ranked low on social indicators. Even the much-touted development under CPEC has done little to rescue Balochistan from poverty.\n\nBalochistan's Gwadar seaport, which is supposed to be the flagship project of the multibillion-dollar CPEC, has unsurprisingly become the main centre of public unrest. While the local population is living in absolute poverty, with few education and healthcare facilities available to them, prime real estate on the coast is being allotted to outsiders. The town has been the venue of many protests in\n\nrecent years. But the BYC was not given permission to arrange a rally in the town for 'security reasons'.\n\nIt is in such circumstances that many Baloch youth, who had lost hope in the flawed democratic political process, have been inclined to join militant groups. Extrajudicial killings and the illegal detention of political activists have pushed many educated and disgruntled youth to the wall. A large number of Baloch students have been picked up allegedly by security agencies from university campuses in the country. The fear is that they will never come home.\n\nSuch draconian measures and denial of democratic rights have been the major reason behind the rise of separatist militancy in the province. Surely, there is some truth to the allegation of external support for Baloch militant groups, but the real cause of the militancy is rooted in state repression and the denial of democratic rights. The state crackdown is providing ready recruits to militant groups. The authorities cannot control the growing public discontent by resorting to brute force. As the events of the past week have shown, repressive action cannot work to crush the people's struggle.\n\nOne has to listen to what Mahrang Baloch and other Baloch leaders are saying. They just want the state to stop enforced disappearances and give the Baloch people their democratic political rights. They also want the Baloch people to get their due share of development and local economic resources. If these saner voices are suppressed, there will be no hope for the future.", "source": {"uri": "dawn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dawn"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zahid_hussain@dawn.com", "name": "Zahid Hussain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforced_disappearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforced disappearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Province"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baloch_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baloch people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balochistan,_Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Balochistan, Pakistan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baloch_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baloch nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwadar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gwadar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gwadar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-establishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-establishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oppression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\u2013Pakistan_Economic_Corridor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbar_Bugti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Akbar Bugti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pervez_Musharraf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pervez Musharraf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Zia-ul-Haq", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_repression", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political repression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tribal chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extreme poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrajudicial_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extrajudicial killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://i.dawn.com/large/2024/07/66a95e0063183.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777971", "eventUri": "eng-9777971", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

We saw it in December last year at the Baloch Long March. We see it now again with the Baloch Raji Machi protests in what is clearly a punitive attempt by the Pakistani authorities to deter, vilify and criminalise peaceful protesters,\" Pant said.\n\nHighlighting the gravity of the situation, Pant called for an immediate halt to the harsh crackdown on Baloch protests and demanded the unconditional release of all individuals detained.\n\n\"The reports of three deaths and the arrest of organisers, including Sammi Deen Baloch, Sabghatullah Shah and Dr. Sabiha Baloch, are extremely concerning and indicative of the continuing decline in civil and political rights in Pakistan. Amnesty International calls for an end to the brutal crackdown on the Baloch protests and the immediate and unconditional release of all those arrested for exercising their right to peaceful assembly\" Pant added.\n\nAdditionally, Pant criticised the government's imposition of roadblocks and shutdowns of internet and mobile networks in Balochistan, which he argued severely restricts movement and access to information.\n\nHe reminded Pakistan of its obligations under both its constitution and international human rights law to uphold freedoms of expression, access to information, movement, and peaceful assembly.\n\nAmnesty's reaction came after Pakistani security forces reportedly took severe actions against participants of a Baloch national gathering.\n\nThe recent crackdown has sparked significant backlash amid fears that these measures might exacerbate rather than alleviate the underlying problems.\n\nThe Baloch community remains subjected to serious human rights violations, notably enforced disappearances, where individuals are taken away by state or affiliated forces without legal avenues, causing immense distress to their families and often leading to severe torture.\n\nAdding to the complexity, extrajudicial killings targeting activists and critics without proper legal procedures have created a climate of fear, suppressing dissent.

The FBM is urging people to join the Baloch diaspora in showing solidarity with the residents of Gwadar, who have been placed under siege.\n\n'Your presence and support can make a difference in amplifying the voices of the oppressed and advocating for justice and peace. Let's unite and stand strong against the injustices faced by the Baloch community,' the movement stated. On July 28, thousands of Baloch people convened near Gwadar for the Baloch National Gathering, a platform for advocating their rights and discussing aspirations for self-determination.\n\nAccording to the Baloch Yakjeti Committee, Pakistani security forces violently attacked the peaceful sit-in, detaining 12 women and 50 men, including prominent activists. Prominent Baloch activist Mahrang Baloch highlighted that Gwadar has been placed under a strict curfew and sealed off from the rest of the region.\n\nThe city has also been cut off from the internet for three days, further isolating residents and obstructing the flow of information about the ongoing violence. Frontier Corps, Pakistani police, and death squads are reportedly beating and torturing residents. The FBM, a political and nationalist organization, advocates for the independence of Balochistan from Pakistan, claiming exploitation and marginalization by the Pakistani government.\n\nThe movement actively engages in political activism and awareness campaigns to garner international recognition and support for Baloch self-determination. The upcoming protest in Hanover aims to draw global attention to the plight of the Baloch people and the human rights abuses they endure.

Critics claim that the Pakistan military had plotted to assassinate Maharang Baloch.\n\nEven as the Pakistan Army cracked down ahead of the protest, people gathered from all over Balochistan and even parts of Sindh and Punjab provinces and marched towards Gwadar, ET has learnt. Despite roadblocks and incidents of firing, the protestors reached Gwadar on July 28.\n\nSubsequently, the local administration imposed a curfew and suspended internet and mobile services in the city. According to local media reports, security forces resorted to firing and baton charge, which caused multiple deaths and injuries to unarmed civilians, including women and children. Incidents of firing and tear gas shelling were also reported from Quetta, Turbat, Mastung and Talar Zero Point, where thousands of Baloch protesters are stranded due to road blocks, claimed reports.\n\nProtests, however, continued across Gwadar on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThe Baloch protesters hold China equally accountable for the \"genocide of locals\", alleging it is to facilitate unhindered exploitation of Balochistan's resources, denying any benefits to the locals.

The colonial rulers have so far deployed every criminal means imaginable to crush and hold back the Baloch freedom struggle, but to no avail.\n\nOne of their criminal schemes has been to turn Baloch against Baloch. A typical example of such acts was the recent failed assassination attempt on Baloch political and human rights leaders. The details of this calculated scenario are as follows: On July 26, 2024, Sarfraz Bugti, the henchman of the Punjabi army of Pakistan (currently serving as the Chief Minister of Balochistan) in Balochistan's bogus parliament, said that \"we have full intelligence report ... that BLA (Baloch Liberation Army) will be exploding a bomb in Gwadar gathering.\"\n\nSarfraz was referring to the Baloch Raaji Muchi (Baloch National Gathering) in Gwadar, which was held on Sunday, July 28, 2024. The Pakistani army, along with political, religious, and commercial establishments, employed every means at their disposal to prevent this gathering. Despite all obstacles, the rally went ahead, with tens of thousands of Baloch men, women, and children participating in this historic event.\n\nDuring the time when Baloch political and human rights activists were delivering their speeches, the organisers of the rally became suspicious of two individuals trying to approach the stage. These two armed individuals, identified as Waleed and Islam, were detained, and they confessed that they had been trained and sent by Pakistani Military Intelligence (MI) to assassinate the leaders of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee, particularly Dr. Mahrang Baloch and Sammi Deen Baloch.\n\nPolitical assassination is embedded in the DNA of Pakistan's colonial theocratic structure. That comes as no surprise. What is less obvious in this failed assassination attempt is the tactic of Baloch killing Baloch, orchestrated by the Punjabi Muslim coloniser of Balochistan. This barbarous conduct is adopted by the vilest regimes, like the Islamic regimes of Pakistan and Iran, against their political opponents, particularly targeting political and human rights activists of their subjugated nations.\n\nSarfraz Bugti's bogus warning that the BLA would attack the meeting was merely a choreographed attempt to conceal their criminal plan. The assassination plot was premeditated, with Sarfraz being one of its principal masterminds. In such a criminal conspiracy, the perpetrators are often selected from the most ignorant, impoverished, and delinquent sections of society. Unbeknownst to these thugs, after they commit the crime, they are likely to be arrested, tortured, and forced to confess to being something they are not. In the case of these two Baloch youths, Waleed and Islam, if they had succeeded in their crime, they would have been arrested and forced to confess that they were members of the BLA. Such individuals are usually eliminated by their sponsors when they are no longer needed.\n\nMeanwhile, the colonial rulers would launch a propaganda campaign to create a rift among the Baloch, claiming that Baloch kill Baloch and that they have arrested and punished the perpetrators of the crime. In such heinous scenarios, the only victims are the Baloch. On one hand, we lose the most conscientious and informed members of our society; on the other hand, we are blamed for their criminal acts. Sarfraz Bugti's speech is of this nature -- it was deliberate and part of a premeditated plan. Fortunately, he and his masters' plan failed. Had it succeeded, they would have claimed, \"we told you so\" about the BLA plan. This is just one of many barbaric policies of colonial rulers that we must not lose sight of, and we must pay due attention to defeating our enemies' criminal schemes. The colonial rulers use every dirty and inhumane trick to divide us and continue their colonial rule, but our unity means the end of their domination.", "source": {"uri": "balochwarna.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Balochwarna/><meta property="}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balochistan_Liberation_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Balochistan Liberation Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baloch_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baloch people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwadar", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gwadar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gwadar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Minister_of_Balochistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief Minister of Balochistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarfraz_Bugti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sarfraz Bugti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Liberation War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabi_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punjabi language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabi_Muslims", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punjabi Muslims"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balochistan,_Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balochistan, Pakistan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Raj"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://balochwarna.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image0-850x560.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777971", "eventUri": "eng-9777971", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The protesters forcibly closed the shops in different areas of the provincial capital. In Khuzdar and adjoining areas, a shutter-down strike was observed against the arrest of leaders of Baloch Solidarity Committee. Businesses remained closed in other areas against alleged sabotage of a rally organised by Raji Machi in Gwadar. Traffic on the national highway was less than normal. Online report says leaders of Baloch Solidarity Committee while talking to the media in Quetta said they had announced a national gathering in Gwadar on July 28. \"Caravans coming from different areas of Balochistan and Sindh were stopped. Firing in Mastung injured our workers. They killed one of our comrades\", they alleged. Another report says due to the sit-in and strike in Gwadar and Mastung, a large number of pilgrims, including women and children, got stuck at the Pak-Iran border. All the highways, including Makran Coastal Highway M8, are closed. Pilgrims stranded at the border are facing food shortages.

On Monday, the military said a soldier was martyred and 16 other security personnel, including an officer, were injured in firing by \"an unruly mob\" in Gwadar during clashes between the forces and supporters of the Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC).\n\nHowever, BYC leader Dr Mahrang Baloch claimed that hundreds of their supporters had been arrested over the past two days.\n\nTaking part in a debate on the matter, BNP-Awami President Mir Asadullah Baloch questioned the state of democracy, where people are barred from holding meetings. He said the protesters are unarmed, and the government should refrain from using force.\n\nGovernment urged to refrain from using force against Gwadar protesters\n\nHe criticised the use of containers and violence against people, asking what has been achieved.\n\nHe lamented that wrong policies have led to the country's global defamation.\n\nMr Baloch said arms are meant for the enemy, not for the people, adding that the entire world is watching Gwadar, and every Baloch household has a martyr, leading to widespread resentment and people joining the armed resistance. He said negotiations should be held with Dr Mahrang to address the prevailing situation.\n\nNational Party's Khair Jan Baloch said his party supports the right to peaceful protest, as enshrined in the Constitution, and condemns all forms of violence that foster hatred. He emphasised that the solution to Balochistan's crisis requires collective effort.\n\nThe government must address the underlying issues, as failure to engage the youth constructively will exacerbate the situation, he said, adding that for a lasting peace, the province should be governed through political means, rather than force.\n\nPPP lawmaker Meena Majeed emphasised that freedom of expression does not entitle individuals to speak on behalf of others while disrespecting them. She strongly condemned the use of derogatory language against Baloch women, saying it's a violation of Balochistan's values. She urged all members of the assembly to take a stand and not remain silent spectators in the face of such injustices.\n\nOpposition leader Mir Younis Aziz Zehri condemned the politics of hatred, emphasising that resolving Balochistan's issues requires a choice between violence and negotiations. He stressed that negotiations are the only viable solution, and urged the government to engage in democratic negotiations and release arrested individuals as a goodwill gesture.\n\nProvincial Minister for Irrigation Mir Sadiq Umrani said the PPP stands firmly against terrorism, extending an invitation to the opposition and protesters to join hands in contributing to Pakistan's development and prosperity. He condemned the anti-Pakistan slogans raised in Gwadar, reaffirming the PPP's commitment to finding solutions through dialogue.\n\nMPA Maulana Hidyatur Rehman said Gwadar is currently facing turmoil. He strongly condemned the shooting of women, resulting in three casualties. \"We condemn the killings, regardless of whether they are committed by the government or the Baloch Liberation Army,\" the Maulana said.\n\nHe said the chief minister had announced that highways would remain open, but the next day containers were placed on all highways across Balochistan. He lamented that the use of force has turned Balochistan into a graveyard, with a curfew in place in Gwadar. \"We will protect CPEC, but it cannot be protected by bullets.\"\n\nMPA Mir Zabid Ali Reki proposed forming a committee consisting of respected tribal elders to facilitate negotiations as only dialogue can resolve issues. He called for releasing all detainees and suggested shutting down social media, which he blamed for disrupting the system.\n\nKalsoom Niaz of the National Party questioned the ban on gatherings in Gwadar, contrasting it with the allowance of similar events in Islamabad. She criticised the provincial government's complete lockdown, leading to food shortages, and demanded the release of all arrested individuals.\n\nMs Niaz emphasised the importance of peaceful politics and resolving Balochistan's issues through dialogue to eliminate the culture of violence.\n\nBAP lawmaker Farah Azim Shah observed that protests often erupt whenever Balochistan makes progress. \"Slogans against our institutions and government were raised in Gwadar.\"\n\nThe assembly session was adjou\u00adr\u00adned until Thursday afternoon.", "source": {"uri": "dawn.com", "dataType":

Some protesters reportedly attacked security forces, killing one soldier and injuring others. Baloch activists have alleged that government security forces have used excessive force to prevent protesters from reaching the port city of Gwadar, the end point of the march. Government authorities have imposed an internet shutdown on Gwadar.\n\n\"Pakistani authorities should uphold the right to peaceful protest and assembly, and when nonviolent means prove ineffective use only the minimum force needed,\" said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \"It's vitally important for the authorities to protect protesters' rights while preventing the situation in Balochistan from spiraling out of control.\"\n\nThe Baloch National Gathering has called for accountability for the numerous cases of enforced disappearances in Balochistan over many years. Such \"disappearances\" have long been a feature of the conflict between the government and armed militants in Balochistan. Pakistan's security forces have also carried out enforced disappearances to silence peaceful critics of the government.\n\nThe nongovernmental organization Human Rights Commission of Pakistan reported that some of the march's organizers received threats to call off the march or face arrest or enforced disappearance. Since July 28, protesters have blocked roads, demanding the release of detained colleagues.\n\nThe United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials provide that security forces must never use excessive force. In dispersing violent assemblies, firearms may only be used when other less harmful means are not practicable but must still be used to the minimum extent necessary. Law enforcement officers may only intentionally resort to lethal force when strictly unavoidable to protect life.\n\nGovernment authorities generally claim that internet shutdowns are necessary to protect public safety and curb the spread of misinformation. However, this sweeping measure denies ordinary people access to lifesaving information, interferes with access to health care, and restricts the ability of journalists to upload photos and videos documenting the government response to the protest. International human rights law prohibits broad, indiscriminate, and indefinite restrictions on fundamental freedoms, including the right to free expression and to provide and receive information, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nThe Pakistan government needs to address the issue of enforced disappearances, which are considered to be a continuing offense. International law defines an enforced disappearance as the detention of anyone by state forces or their agents who refuse to acknowledge the detention or whereabouts of the person, placing them outside the protection of the law.\n\nActivists in Balochistan say that there have been 7,000 enforced disappearances in the province since 2004. Since March 2011, Pakistan's Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances has received thousands of complaints of enforced disappearances across the country. The victims are most often from the marginalized sections of society, and once forcibly disappeared are often at risk of torture and extrajudicial execution. The government has not held anyone responsible for disappearances accountable.\n\n\"Balochistan has the highest number of enforced disappearances in all of Pakistan, with the authorities willfully ignoring calls for accountability for years,\" Gossman said. \"The authorities should end these abuses, prosecute those responsible, and provide redress for the victims and their families.\"\n\n/Public Release.

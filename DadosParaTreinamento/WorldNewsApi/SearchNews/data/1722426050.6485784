Headlined by some of the biggest acts in the world, including Dua Lipa, Coldplay, SZA, Shania Twain, and Burna Boy, the weekend so far has also provided its fair share of surprises. Here's what you may have missed. For the first time in history, Glastonbury has two female headliners For the first time in its 50-plus year history, Glastonbury will be headlined by two female acts on the Pyramid Stage. Artists Dua Lipa and SZA have been awarded the coveted spot (alongside Coldplay). It follows the 2023 festival which was criticised for announcing a line-up led by all-male headliners (Elton John, Arctic Monkeys and Guns N' Roses). So how many women have actually headlined the Pyramid Stage in the last 20 years? You can count them on one hand: Billie Eilish \u2014 2022Adele \u2014 2016Florence and The Machine \u2014 2015Beyonce \u2014 2011Kylie Minogue \u2014 2005 Taylor Swift was supposed to headline Glastonbury in 2020, but the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Dua Lipa performed on Friday night, local time, while SZA will close the main stage on Sunday. Playing a headline slot clearly meant a lot to Dua who said on stage: \"This is a dream come true.\"I have written this moment down, I've wished for it, I've dreamt it, I've worked so hard in the hopes that maybe one day I'll get to do it and I can't believe I'm here, it feels so good to be up here with you guys.\" The crowd goes silent for seven minutes If there's one thing the Glastonbury Festival doesn't do well, it's silence. But that changed on Friday evening when performance artist Marina Abramovic led a seven-minute silence from the festival's main stage. The 420 seconds of silence was conceived as a \"public intervention\" to reflect on conflict, violence and peace. \"There are wars, there is famine, there is protest, there is killing,\" Abramovic said. \"Here, we will try to do something different. \"We can all together give unconditional love to each other. [It is] the only way to change the world.\" More than 200,000 festival goers were asked to close their eyes and put their hands on a neighbour's shoulder. On stage, 77-year-old Abramovic stretched out her arms to reveal a dress designed in the shape of the CND symbol. CND stands for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Overcrowding once again during Sugababes set The last time Sugababes played at Glastonbury in 2022, they pulled in such enormous crowds that police had to \"push the button\" and shut down the area, stopping more people from arriving. And it seems as though overcrowding has happened once again, even though festival organisers scheduled them on a larger stage to avoid a repeat. The West Holts stage was reportedly full before the group's set even started with some fans missing out on the performance. Here's what a few people commented on social media: \"Once again my ambitions to see Sugababes at Glastonbury have been thwarted. They should do the Legend slot next year.\" \"The Sugababes crowd at West Holts is humungous! Like absolutely packed out.\" \"Glastonbury organisers totally underestimated how popular this set would be.\" Confidence Man represents Australia Australian indie electro-pop band Confidence Man delivered their trademark dose of fun at Glastonbury. The four-piece took to the Other Stage where they performed classic fan favourites. They even sang a few lines from their forthcoming record. This was the group's second time performing at the festival. K-pop boy band Seventeen make Glastonbury history Boy band Seventeen have made history at the festival, by becoming the first K-pop group to play the main Pyramid Stage. \"We are extremely honoured to be here,\" they said on stage. \"We'll show you what kind of team Seventeen is.\" The 13-piece group had the biggest-selling album worldwide last year and were the second biggest-selling artist of 2023, surpassed only by Taylor Swift, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. Dua Lipa brings Tame Impala singer on stage The pop star didn't just surprise her fans with the many fireworks and costume changes that happened during the set, she also brought out Kevin Parker of Tame Impala for a duet of the band's hit The Less I Know the Better. Fans were shocked to see Parker up on stage with her \u2014 after several media outlets were sure it would be Calvin Harris. \"This is history being made,\" one social media user wrote on X. Parker's appearance may appear a little unusual but the collaboration comes off the back of the singer working on her new album Radical Optimism.", "summary": "Glastonbury is the biggest festival in the UK, attracting the equivalent of more than two MCG's worth of people.

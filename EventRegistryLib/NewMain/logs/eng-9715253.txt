She joins reigning MVP A'Ja Wilson for the Western Conference as POTW, with Wilson bringing in 25.2 points per game, 9.2 rebounds per game, and 3.0 assists per game.\n\nAccording to the official WNBA Twitter/X page, Angel Reese is the first rookie this season to take home Player of the Week honors. While on her way to making history for the most consecutive double-doubles in a single season, she averaged 16.8 points, 14.0 rebounds, and 1.2 assists per game for games played thru Week 7.\n\nReese continues to play at a high level and helped the Sky secure a 2-1 record from July 2-7. The Sky took on the Atlanta Dream on July 2, which saw Reese secure 12 points, 19 rebounds, three assists, and two blocks. The Sky would win by a final score of 85-77.\n\nOn July 5, the Sky took on the Seattle Storm. They would win with a final score of 88-84, with Reese bringing in 27 points, 10 rebounds, two assists, and two blocks.\n\nOn July 7, the Sky and Storm faced off yet again. This time, the Storm would be victorious with a final score of 84-71. Despite the loss, Reese amassed 17 points, 14 rebounds, four steals, and one block.\n\nSunday, Reese set the record for consecutive double-doubles, with her 13th in a row. Reese has now surpassed Parker, who set the record of 12 between the 2009 and 2010 seasons.\n\nIt took Parker two seasons to secure this number, and Reese has surpassed it with plenty of games left on the 2024 schedule. By season's end, Reese could add on a few more double-doubles. Securing 13 in a row is already impressive enough, but she continues to showcase an elite skillset that could lead to a few more happening in the next few games.\n\nThe Sky and Reese will next take on the Dream again on July 10. Reese secured a career-high 19 rebounds during their last match on July 2. Though it would be believed the Dream will alter their plans to best the Sky, Reese could still find her way into securing 14 consecutive double-doubles.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_brizuela@newsweek.com", "name": "James Brizuela", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candace_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Candace Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WNBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2425003/chicago-sky-guard-angel-reese.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=bcb74894aff034476f023f318a0330a1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-02", "dateEnd": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 1295, "textEnd": 1303}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-02", "textStart": 1342, "textEnd": 1348, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 1477, "textEnd": 1483}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 1644, "textEnd": 1650}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 2430, "textEnd": 2437}], "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

In recognition of this accomplishment, Reese revealed on social media that a key figure from within the Sky organization has given her a special present.\n\nReese on Monday took to Instagram Stories to show off a cake that she received from the Sky's principal owner, Michael J.

Calling him \"Mr. Michael,\" Reese was clearly honored to have received what looks like a pretty tasty cake -- which was personalized to read \"Angel WNBA record consecutive double doubles.\"\n\nJust 20 games into her WNBA career, Reese leads the league in offensive rebounds and total rebounds per game. Recent games have shown an improvement offensively, too -- under the tutelage of respected head coach Teresa Weatherspoon, Reese set a new career high with 27 points in a win over Seattle on Friday, and she has shot better than 50 percent from the floor in four of her past seven games.\n\nReese was just named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week on the strength of her recent displays -- and the Sky, trying to enter the Olympic break in a playoff position, will hope she can keep the double-double streak rolling in the three games before the break.

Sky rookie Angel Reese put up her 13th straight double-double, setting a WNBA record. However, the press conference will be remembered for an awkward hot-mic snafu that turn the whole affair into a viral video.\n\nThe press conference got awkward when it appeared that one of the reporters on the call forgot to mute their microphone. It sounded like they had a very personal conversation with someone else within earshot of their microphone, which was then shared with everyone at the press conference.\n\nIt all started when an unfamiliar female voice came across the feed.\n\n\"Are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?\" a female voice was heard saying in the background.\n\n\"I'm sorry the last part cut off,\" Reese chimed in, probably assuming that she did not hear them correctly.\n\n\"Oh my, that's an uncomfortable topic,\" a man's voice said, to which Reese responded with, \"Excuse me?\"\n\nAt this point, one of the Sky's media members asked the reporter to repeat their question. However, it was clear that they were wrapped up in their other conversation.\n\n\"I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone,\" the man said.\n\nMarina Mabrey, Angel Reese, and Teresa Weatherspoon were visibly confused and shocked in the moment.\n\nBut who was the audio coming from? The actual answer might surprise you.\n\nAccording to The Chicago Tribune, the whole situation happened because of \"a live audio feed of a slightly risqu\u00e9 scene from the [TV show] 'Big Bang Theory' on WGN on the Zoom feed.\"\n\nThankfully this awkward situation can all be chalked up to technical difficulties. It is something the Sky can look back on and laugh about instead of their tough loss to Seattle.\n\nChicago Sky suffer tough loss to Seattle Storm after leading at halftime\n\nThe Chicago Sky could not defeat the Seattle Storm on Sunday, but they did set a WNBA record.\n\nThe Sky fell 84-71 to the Storm in a game where they had control for large parts of the game. Chicago had an eight-point lead after the first quarter and carried it into the half. However, Seattle went on a 29-14 run in the third quarter that was too much for Chicago to overcome.\n\nAngel Reese led the team in minutes and put up 17 points and 14 rebounds. This led to her logging a 13th consecutive double-double, a WNBA record.\n\nReese dominated against the Storm on Friday, scoring a season-high 27 points with 10 rebounds in a 88-84 victory. She played well again on Sunday, but her team could not rally around her to secure the victory.\n\nDespite the loss, Reese believes that the Sky have made some nice progress during their most recent road trip.\n\n\"I think there were positives,\" Reese said in the postgame press conference. \"We went 2-1 on the road, being able to endure on a long stretch.

But, apparently, Reese and the Sky have no desire to see that streak end anytime soon.\n\nIn a WNBA yearly tradition, several teams host afternoon games to allow young girls at summer camps to attend games while on vacation from school.\n\nRELATED: Caitlin Clark Records Double-Double, Fever Comeback Falls Short Against Mystics\n\nThe Sky had an 11 a.m. tip-off on Wednesday against the Atlanta Dream, one of four teams not currently occupying a playoff spot in the WNBA.\n\nChicago was favored entering the contest, but it was a close battle that entered the fourth quarter all tied at 54 points.\n\nBut the Sky took control in the final frame at home, outscoring the Dream 24-15 to win by nine points. Except, they should have won by seven.\n\nAngel Reese entered the fourth quarter with double-digit rebounds (11) and added two more in the quarter. But she only had seven points, putting her streak in jeopardy.\n\nRELATED: Deep Dive Into Angel Reese Stats Paints Grim Picture Of Sky Rookie's Skills\n\nShe struggled to score in the final quarter, missing two layups over the first nine minutes. With 25 seconds left, she finally converted a layup to give the Sky a five-point lead.\n\nIt was a crucial bucket for the team, but left Reese one point away from 10 points.\n\nThe Dream failed to score on their ensuing possession and the Sky hit two free throws after an intentional foul. Atlanta once again failed to score and were content to let the clock run out and end the game.\n\nRather than just dribble out the rest of the clock, like almost every basketball team does in that situation, Chicago guard Chennedy Carter decided to get the ball to Reese, who was calling for a pass.\n\nClearly, Reese knew she needed those points to get into double-figures and, despite the game being over, she wasn't going to pass up the opportunity to pad the stats and add to her record.\n\nUltimately, Dream forward Tina Charles fouled Reese as she tried to get to the hoop to get her bucket. That sent Reese to the free-throw line for two meaningless - at least in terms of the actual game - foul shots.\n\nShe hit both, \"earning\" her 14th consecutive double-double.\n\nThe WNBA official social media team wrote that Reese iced the game with those free throws. However, the game was already \"iced.\"\n\nAfter the game, Carter said she had no idea that Reese needed one point for a double-double. However, she said her teammates, coach and Reese let her know.\n\n\"I looked at [head coach Teresa Weatherspoon], I looked at the bench, and they were like 'throw it in,' throw it in,'\" Carter said.\n\nLook, we've seen players do things like this before, but this push to make sure Angel Reese is front-and-center at all times feels over-the-top.\n\nAlso, for someone who talks about her teammates all the time, Reese was VERY aware of her stats in this game and BEGGED for the ball to make sure she \"got hers.\"\n\nSo, the streak continues.

Reese had just nine points on her ledger at that time, and Chicago held a seven-point lead. The Sky seemed content to let the clock run out, but Reese still called for the ball in the paint.\n\nMORE: Breaking down Angel Reese's record-breaking double-double streak\n\nHer teammate Marina Mabrey saw Reese's plea and tossed the ball to her. The Dream then fouled Reese, and the 22-year-old drained two free throws to extend her streak.\n\nUnderstandably, some WNBA fans are annoyed by how Reese got her 14th consecutive double-double, but it's hard to blame Reese for wanting to continue her historic streak -- the longest in WNBA history. Yes, the game was already decided, but she was just looking to get one last shot off to try to preserve her record.\n\nThat Reese got fouled was hardly her fault. If anything, Dream veteran Tina Charles may have switched onto Reese and swiped at her with the intention to give her a great chance to continue the streak.\n\nReese didn't ask for that, however. She just requested the ball from her teammate and was granted her wish.\n\nPerhaps if Reese was more blatantly forcing shots up at the end of the games, fans would have a legitimate gripe. That said, she attempted just nine shots in the contest and four free throws; had she been more aggressive earlier, she likely would have locked up the double-double well before the game's final seconds.\n\nStill, it's fair to call what Reese did on Chicago's final possession against Atlanta stat-padding. It's just not as big a deal as certain fans are making it out to be -- much like those up in arms about Reese's penchant for grabbing her misses as offensive rebounds.\n\nMORE: How 'Big Bang Theory' created awkward moment for Angel Reese\n\nEven without her final two free throws, Reese would have had a great game against Atlanta. She and fellow rookie Kamilla Cardoso both posted double-doubles and were forces in the paint and on the glass for Chicago.\n\nReese continues to show off a well-rounded defensive skill set as well. Her effort level remains unmatched by most on the boards and in the paint on defense.\n\nReese now averages 14.1 points and a WNBA-leading 11.9 rebounds per game this season, and there's a good chance she will finish the season averaging a double-double.\n\nWill that be enough for her to earn the WNBA's Rookie of the Year award over Caitlin Clark?

However, things got interesting when an online interview with a reporter seemingly had a glitch of sorts.\n\nThe reporter apparently forgot to turn off his mic, which then picked up a strange conversation that had nothing to do with anything pertaining to the Sky-Storm game or to basketball in general. It had since been explained that the noises were not actually from real people but from dialogues in Big Bang Theory that were running in the background.\n\nNow that it has all been cleared up, Angel Reese went on X (the social media platform formerly known as Twitter) to express her reaction to the hilarious moment that had everyone scratching their heads.\n\n\"i was shook. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd23,\" Reese wrote in a post on Monday.\n\nAngel Reese continues to shine in rookie WNBA season\n\nEven though the Sky suffered a double-digit loss to the Storm, there was no denying that Reese played a terrific game and put up an incredible effort. The former LSU Tigers star finished the contest with 17 points and 14 rebounds to extend her double-double streak to 13 games, which is now the WNBA record. She also added four steals and a block while shooting an efficient 8/15 from the field versus the Storm.\n\nReese is leading the entire league in rebounding with 11.9 boards per game and is averaging 14.1 points, 1.9 assists, and 1.5 blocks per outing. Although just a rookie, Reese is already among the best players in the league. What's scary is that she's still got plenty of room to grow.\n\nDrafted seventh overall by the Sky in the 2024 WNBA Draft, Reese isn't just playing a big role for Chicago on the court but can be attributed as well for the dramatic increase of attention in women's basketball. Her rivalry with Indiana Fever rookie Caitlin Clark and a game to back her colorful personality up have people constantly paying attention to her and the league.\n\nReese, Sky still looking to establish consistency\n\nChicago has yet to win three games in a row so far in the 2024 campaign. The Sky nearly pulled that off for the first time on Sunday but their two-game win streak got snapped by the Storm. Before that contest, Chicago defeated the Atlanta Dream and the Storm last Tuesday and Friday, respectively. Their latest loss to Seattle was the third time this season that the Sky failed to follow up a two-game undefeated stretch with a victory.\n\nDespite their struggles, the Sky are still clearly in the thick of the race for a playoff spot. Entering Tuesday, the Sky's 8-12 record is good for eighth in the WNBA. In front of them are Clark and the Fever with a 9-13 record. Directly behind Chicago are the Dream which sport a 7-13 ledger.\n\nChicago's offense can use some improvement to get the team going. The Sky are just 10th in the league with 98.0 points per 100 possessions. Moreover, Chicago owns the worst effective field goal percentage (45.2%) and true shooting percentage (49.5%). Their defense is much more respectable, though, as they are giving up just 100.2 points per 100 possessions -- fifth-best in the WNBA.\n\nReese and the Sky will look to get back on track this coming Wednesday with a home game against the Dream.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rexwell_villas@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Rexwell Villas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Mabrey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marina Mabrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Weatherspoon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Weatherspoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Field goal percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sky-news-Angel-Reeses-3-word-reaction-to-online-interview-mishap-after-Storm-clash.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Forward Angel Reese, coach Teresa Weatherspoon and guard Marina Mabrey were fielding questions following an 84-71 loss to the Seattle Storm.\n\nOne reporter was attempting to ask Reese about breaking the WNBA record for consecutive double-doubles when she was cut off. Another reporter's microphone came on at the same time, causing Reese to ask the first journalist to repeat her question.\n\nThen \"that's an uncomfortable topic\" could clearly be heard from the second reporter. As Weatherspoon and the players struggled to make sense of what was happening, \"I've never been interested in having an intimate relationship with anyone\" was also heard on the call.\n\nThat led to some funny reactions from Reese and Mabrey, and you can view the moment below.\n\nAlthough it might have seemed like the reporter who left their mic unmuted had some personal drama going on, it would all end up being a big misunderstanding. The audio heard was apparently from an episode of the \"Big Bang Theory,\" so we really just caught someone with some background TV on at work.\n\nStill, the press conference moment provided some funny reactions from Chicago Sky players and an interesting watch if nothing else. The first reporter ultimately still got her question in to Reese as things returned to normalcy shortly after.\n\nChicago fell to 8-12 on the season with the loss and currently sits in eight place in the WNBA standings. The Sky are next scheduled to play the Atlanta Dream at noon ET on Wednesday.\n\nChicago Sky rookie Angel Reese recorded the second double-double of her WNBA career on June 4 in a WNBA Commissioner's Cup matchup against the New York Liberty with 13 points and 10 rebounds. And ever since that day, Reese has started a streak that now sits atop the WNBA record books.\n\nIn the third quarter of Chicago's Sunday matchup against the Seattle Storm, Reese cleaned up a missed layup by teammate Kamilla Cardoso with an offensive rebound and put-back layup to record her 11th point and 11th rebound of the game. Which officially made her the WNBA's record holder for consecutive double-doubles with 13 on the season in her rookie year.\n\nReese was selected by the Chicago Sky with the No. 7 overall pick of the 2024 WNBA Draft this year following a standout college career at LSU and Maryland.

The Chicago Sky rookie has been on a tear, securing double-doubles on a regular basis. Now she has surpassed WNBA legend Candace Parker in that category.\n\nReese secured her 13th consecutive double-double on Sunday when the Sky took on the Seattle Storm. Though the Sky would fall 84-71, the night was marked with a historic performance from the rookie. Reese would post 17 points and 14 rebounds en route to her WNBA record.\n\nThe previous consecutive double-double record was set by Candace Parker, who secured 10 in a row between the 2009 and 2010 seasons.\n\nReese spoke to reporters after the game, stating, \"I'm just trying to be consistent for my teammates, doing whatever I can to help my team. I think I didn't do enough tonight, but just being able to be there for my teammates and knowing that I have a job to do every day no matter if I'm a rookie or a vet.\"\n\nDespite her amazing feat, Reese still took the moment to instead be critical of her performance and state that she \"didn't do enough.\"\n\nSky head coach Teresa Weatherspoon also commented on Reese's new WNBA record.\n\n\"It's absolutely amazing to see,\" the first-year head coach said of Reese's feat. \"She might be surprising herself, but she's not surprising me. It's something that she can do because it's something that she puts the work in to be able to do. And it's a will and want-to... it's awesome to see the work that you have to put in to be able to do this.\"\n\nReese continues to showcase a work ethic and skill set that should lead to her being a dominant force in the WNBA for years to come. The next feat she can accomplish is to win Rookie of the Year, though she will need to outperform Clark.\n\nAccording to current odds on Bovada, Clark is at -500 odds to win ROTY and Reese is second at +225.

The Chicago Sky forward was named the WNBA Player of the Week on Tuesday, becoming the first member of the 2024 WNBA Draft class to receive the honor this season.\n\nReese received the honor after breaking the league's consecutive double-double streak, recording 13 straight double-doubles. She also averaged 16.8 points, 14.0 rebounds and 1.2 assists per game through Week 7.\n\nChicago played three games that week, posting a 2-1 record. The Sky defeated the Atlanta Dream 85-77 on Tuesday and the Seattle Storm 88-84 on Friday. The Storm then got revenge on Sunday, posting an 84-71 victory over the Sky.\n\nAlong with the incredible double-double streak, Reese is also the only rookie currently averaging a double-double, recording 14.1 points and 11.9 rebounds per contest. Her rebounding average is currently the best in the WNBA.\n\nBecoming the first rookie to claim Player of the Week honors in 2024 is a pretty impressive feat considering the talent in this year's rookie class. Reese is competing with Caitlin Clark (Indiana Fever), Rickea Jackson (Los Angeles Sparks) and teammate Kamilla Cardoso and others.\n\nReese was also named the WNBA Rookie of the Month in June, averaging 14.5 points, 13.2 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game for the month. She was also selected as a WNBA All-Star.\n\nConsidering the amount of success she's enjoyed so far, it's hard to believe Reese slipped to the No. 7 pick in the WNBA Draft back in April.

Seeing as Reese has been recording double-doubles in points and rebounds in double-digit consecutive games, this should be an easily achievable feat for the rookie.\n\nIn a road rematch against the Seattle Storm on July 7, she made WNBA history by recording her 13th consecutive double-double, finishing the game with 17 points and 14 rebounds.

I believe in my sisters through whatever challenges we have,\" Reese said during the postgame press conference, as reported by Christopher Smith of ClutchPoints.\n\nReese's 12 consecutive double-doubles had already broken Candace Parker's record, marking her as one of the league's most promising talents. Reese has recorded 14 double-doubles so far for the season, per Alexa Philippou of ESPN.\n\n\"She's the GOAT,\" Reese said of Parker. \"I've always respected 'CP3,' and I've tried to take some things from her game and add it to mine.\"\n\nReese's admiration extends to other WNBA legends like Lisa Leslie, and she credits her success to the support of her coaches and teammates.\n\n\"I have coaches and teammates around me that believe in me ... I'm grateful. I'm blessed and lucky to be named with these amazing players,\" she said.\n\nAs the Sky prepare to face the Atlanta Dream on Wednesday, Reese will aim for her 14th consecutive double-double, and getting closer to clinching the WNBA single-season rebound record.\n\nRelated: Seattle Storm Coach Drops Angel Reese Truth Bomb After Beating Chicago Sky\n\nRelated: Angel Reese Has Three-Word Message For Candace Parker After Breaking Her WNBA Record", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erin_achenbach@postandcourier.com", "name": "Erin Achenbach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candace_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Candace Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Leslie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lisa Leslie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/71/47144581-bfd5-549e-864f-bb49969887b6/668c9f09232be.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 533, "textEnd": 539}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

They revealed that Reese has been named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week from June 27 to July 7.\n\nDuring that span, Reese led the Sky to a 2-3 record. She averaged 16.8 points, 14 rebounds, and 1.2 assists. Reese also broke the WNBA record for most consecutive double-doubles of all time with 13 straight, passing Los Angeles Sparks legend Candace Parker.\n\nThis award marks the first Player of the Week achievement for Reese. It adds to her case for Rookie of the Year, which has come down to her and Indiana Fever rookie Caitlin Clark at this point.\n\nClark is yet to win a Player of the Week award in her rookie season, but she has won Rookie of the Month. She also recorded the first triple-double by a rookie in WNBA history.\n\nReese and the Sky will play their next game on Wednesday, July 10, against the Atlanta Dream.

The result, more and more comparisons between Reese and Parker, a player who Reese calls \"the GOAT.\"\n\n\"I've always respected CP3 and I even try to take some things from her game and try to add them to mine,\" Reese said following the Sky's loss to the Seattle Storm on Sunday. \"Being able to be named with an amazing player like that is always going to be special to me.\"\n\nIt's easy to see a few quick parallels between Reese and Parker. They're each highly talented power forwards who can score as easily as they collect rebounds, they each helped to propel the WNBA's popularity to new heights in their own eras, and they each have major ties to Chicago.\n\nParker grew up in Naperville and played for the Sky in 2020 and 2021. Reese has adopted Chicago as her new home.\n\nHowever, there's a particularly key part of Parker's career that Reese hopes will become another major comparison point between her and her role model.\n\n\"One thing I've always looked at her as, is a champion,\" Reese said. \"My big thing is to continue to be named with her, I want to win. Being able to come out and come to Chicago, rep for her city and bring a championship home is what's going to be important for me and what I look forward to.\"\n\nIt's clear that Reese enjoys her successes and that making WNBA history is important to her. She got visibly emotional when Sky head coach Teresa Weatherspoon announced Reese earned All-Star honors. But the main thing will always remain the main thing for her: winning.\n\n\"I'm just trying to be consistent for my teammates, doing whatever I can to help my team... I have a job to do every day, no matter if I'm a rookie or a vet.\"\n\nReese will continue to make headlines as she continues to develop as a pro. There's more history for her ahead, if she maintains the pace she's set over the first 20 games of the year.\n\nIf Reese keeps doing what she's doing, she'll shatter Yolanda Griffith's record for most offensive rebounds in a single season. Griffith pulled down 162 offensive boards in 2001.

She's earned some recognition and accolades for her achievements recently, including the league's Rookie of the Month Award for June and WNBA Player of the Week in Week 7 (the first rookie to win the award since Aliyah Boston in June 2023).\n\nNow it's time to talk about why, if the season ended today, she should win the Rookie of the Year Award.\n\nFor nearly the entire first half of the season, Indiana Fever superstar Caitlin Clark was considered a shoo-in to win the prestigious award. Take Clark's incredible popularity across the nation out of the mix and there were still plenty of reasons why she deserved to be considered the runaway favorite.\n\nThrough the first month of the season, Clark led all rookies in scoring (17.6 ppg), 3-pointers made (24), free throws made (42), assists (6.6 apg) and minutes played (33.0 mpg). She joined Candace Parker and Sabrina Ionescu to become the third player in WNBA history to record 100+ points, 30+ rebounds and 30+ assists in her first six career games.\n\nClark battled through physical defenses that tried to knock her off of her game, and still managed to play at a high level more often than not. It was a sensational start to one of the most sensationalized rookie seasons in recent memory.\n\nSince then, however, Reese has made it a two-horse race.\n\nAfter finding her footing over the first few weeks of the season, Reese has flourished and made WNBA history in the process. So far in July, she's averaging 16.8 points, 14 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 1.8 steals per game. Each of those numbers is better, or at least the same, as the numbers she put up in June when she won the Rookie of the Month award. She's developed a well-rounded game both offensively and defensively.\n\nMost impressively, she's set a new WNBA record for most consecutive double-doubles at 14 games and counting. That's not a rookie record, or a single-season record, or any other caveat you can think of. No other woman in WNBA history has ever matched Reese's current double-double streak.\n\nIf Reese keeps playing at her current pace, she'll continue to write her name in the WNBA history books. With 250 total rebounds and 99 offensive rebounds in 21 games, she's on pace to finish the year with 476 boards and 188 second-chance opportunities. Each number would shatter the current top marks in the league. Sylvia Fowles' 404 total rebounds in 2018 are the current single-season record, as are Yolanda Griffith's 162 offensive boards in 2001.\n\nAgain, these records are not just among rookies- it covers all of WNBA history.\n\nClark has made some impressive WNBA history of her own, like becoming the first rookie to ever notch a triple-double, but she's not approaching any WNBA single-season records like Reese.\n\nThere is another big differentiator when you look at their personal numbers: Reese has made far fewer mistakes with the ball.\n\nAfter Wednesday's slate of games Clark has turned the ball over a whopping 127 times this season. That leads the WNBA by a wide margin, with Alyssa Thomas's 84 turnovers coming in second. Reese only has 38 turnovers to her name. To be fair, Clark handles the ball a lot more than Reese, so she has more opportunities to turn the ball over. But she also has more opportunities for assists. When you look at the ratio of assists and steals- two plays that can be viewed as a turnover-neutralizer- for each player, Reese fares better.\n\nFor every turnover this year, Clark has 1.65 assists and steals. Reese is at 1.89. Not a huge difference, but a difference when we're trying to determine who should be named the Rookie of the Year.\n\nThat difference shows up in how each team fares when the players are on and off the court, too. A Rookie of the Year should be someone who elevates the team's performance significantly when she's in the game, and once again the arrow tips to Reese when you look at the analytics.\n\nReese carries a 1.9 +/- rating, meaning the Sky typically score just under two more points than their opponents when she's on the floor. Clark has a -5.1 +/- rating, meaning the Fever are outscored by over five points when she's playing.\n\nThe offensive efficiency ratings tell a similar story. According to Basketball Reference, the Sky have a 101.6 ORtg with Reese on the court and 96.7 ORtg with Reese on the bench. That means over the course of 100 possessions, the Sky are expected to score 4.9 more points with Reese than without her. On the other hand, the Fever have a 102.6 ORtg with Clark and a 103.7 ORtg without her- so they're expected to score 1.1 fewer points over 100 possessions with her on the court.\n\nInterestingly, the Fever's assist rate also drops 3.8%, while their rebound rate jumps 1.4% and their turnover rate increases 2.8% with Clark on the floor, per Basketball Reference. When Reese is in the game, the Sky's assist rate drops a similar 4%, but their rebound rate rockets up 10.9%.Their turnover rate increases the exact same 2.8%\n\nYour conclusion reading all of this shouldn't be that the Fever are somehow better off without Clark. That's not the case. It's just that she hasn't elevated the overall team's play in the same way that Reese has helped the Sky- or the Fever haven't figured out how to incorporate Clark's game into their overall team game as well as the Sky have integrated Reese.\n\nWhat Clark and Reese have each accomplished up to this point is remarkable, and there's still a lot of basketball left to be played. Trends will change and there's a chance more history will be made. But if the second half of the season goes like the first half did, then Reese should be named the league's top rookie by year's end.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Ionescu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Ionescu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candace_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Candace Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yolanda_Griffith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yolanda Griffith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Fowles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sylvia Fowles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Reference", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports Reference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyssa_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alyssa Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TEuf276z8VNzSBJzBvwQGA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnchicago.com/213da108ffa0d22c2eeb5a5d55240519", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Angel Reese is coming off a historic week, earning several WNBA honors and breaking records left and right. Reese spoke about her desired \"trademark\": her player reputation that will leave the rest of the league on high alert.\n\n\"A fierce competitor. I want be known [as someone who is] not going to let down,\" Reese told reporters after practice on Tuesday. \"Being able to talk to some of the vets, they say 'You're super consistent. You come out everyday and play super hard,' and I want that to be a known trademark for me. I want it to be known expectations are high. Angel's going to come out [and] you can't take a play off... so being able to start that off early in my career as a rookie, I think that's important. And being able to have vets that recognize it: talking to Nneka [Ogwumike], talking to Skylar [Diggins-Smith]... it's great to have those connections.\"\n\nReese amassed her 13th straight double-double against the Seattle Storm on July 7, breaking Candace Parker's WNBA record for most consecutive in league history. As the rookie forward mentioned, it takes supreme consistency to sustain such a high level of production. Yet, Reese is not deterred by the challenge. She embraces it, and she is grateful to have inspiring figures like Parker help her along the way.\n\n\"It's amazing... Candace Parker, the GOAT. She's been a great inspiration to me all my life. [I've been] watching her, even since she was at Tennessee. When I was younger, I wanted to go to Tennessee and play for Pat [Summitt]. And just being able to see her phenomenal career and her being a mom [is inspiring]... so I'm super grateful and super blessed,\" Reese added.\n\nAngel Reese notes key markers of Sky growth through WNBA season's start\n\nReese provided insight into one thing she learned about her team midway through the season that she did not know at the beginning.\n\n\"We fight,\" Reese replied. \"We fight until the end. I think sometimes we don't bring the fight until the end. I think just being able to be consistent throughout all four quarters is something that's going to be important for the second stretch. But I think we know who we have and who were are. And I think our chemistry continues to grow.\"\n\nChicago started the year off strong but endured a cold streak that saw them lose four games in a row. Nevertheless, as Reese said, her team fought and improved their record to eight-place in the WNBA standings. Despite going up against greater experience, and arguably more talent, Chicago remains one of the grittiest teams in the league.\n\nAngel Reese looks to continue her stout interior presence to help the Sky stay in the 2024 WNBA playoff picture.

I want to be known (as someone who is) not going to let down,\" Reese said, as reported by Christopher Smith of ClutchPoints. \"Being able to talk to some of the vets, they say 'You're super consistent. You come out every day and play super hard,' and I want that to be a known trademark for me. I want it to be known expectations are high. Angel's going to come out [and] you can't take a play off... so being able to start that off early in my career as a rookie, I think that's important. And being able to have vets that recognize it: talking to Nneka (Ogwumike), talking to Skylar (Diggins-Smith)... it's great to have those connections.\"\n\nReese's determination has been evident in her recent games. She recently recorded her 13th consecutive double-double against the Seattle Storm, breaking Candace Parker's WNBA record for most consecutive double-doubles. She has notched 14 double-doubles for the whole season.\n\nReese was also named the WNBA's June Rookie of the Month, as well as Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the week June 30-July 7.\n\nReflecting on her team's growth, Reese said, \"We fight. We fight until the end. I think sometimes we don't bring the fight until the end. I think just being able to be consistent throughout all four quarters is something that's going to be important for the second stretch.\"\n\nThe Sky started the season strong but faced a mid-season slump, losing four games in a row. Despite the challenges, Reese and her team have fought their way back to eighth place in the standings.\n\nAs Reese continues to shine, she aims to help keep the Sky in the playoff picture. The team is preparing for a tough matchup against the Liberty at Wintrust Arena on July 10.\n\nRelated: Seattle Storm Coach Drops Angel Reese Truth Bomb After Beating Chicago Sky\n\nRelated: Angel Reese On Track to Shatter WNBA Rebound Record", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erin_achenbach@postandcourier.com", "name": "Erin Achenbach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nneka_Ogwumike", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nneka Ogwumike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylar_Diggins-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skylar Diggins-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(WNBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (WNBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintrust_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wintrust Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/31/d3129fc1-40be-55c8-913c-950935d5dbf4/668db476bbeb9.image.jpg?crop=1146%2C602%2C0%2C99&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "dateEnd": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 1361, "textEnd": 1375}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 2017, "textEnd": 2024}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

And just being able to be named with an amazing player like that is always going to be special to me.\"\n\nReese scored 17 points and grabbed 14 rebounds for the 13th-straight game with a double-double. That broke Parker's record of 12-consecutive games, which dates back to 2010. Reese, 22, watched Parker, 38, growing up back in the 2010s. The No. 7 pick in this year's draft from LSU talked up the many stars who came before her on Sunday.\n\nParker firmly established herself as an all-time great with the Los Angeles Sparks from 2008 to 2020 and most recently with the Las Vegas Aces. She won three WNBA titles and two MVPs along the way before she retired this year.\n\n\"I'm grateful, I'm blessed and lucky to be named with these amazing players.\" And I know they've always been super nice to me. They've always been helpful and inspiring to me. \"I've watched them all my life, and finally, I get to be here in this moment and ... break their records,\" Reese said.\n\n\"To be up there with them is really cool, so I've always given my flowers to them before me because they laid the ground for me,\" she added.\n\nReese had a stellar college career at LSU where she led the Tigers to a national title in 2023. She became an instant star in the WNBA and recently earned All-Star honors, and she's in the running for Rookie of the Year.\n\nReese averages a double-double with 14.1 points and 11.9 rebounds this season. The 6-foot-3 forward also averages 1.9 assists and 1.5 steals per contest.\n\n\"She might be surprising herself, but she's not surprising me,\" Sky head coach Teresa Weatherspoon told reporters. \"It's something that you know she can do because it's something that she puts the work into being able to do. And it's a will and a want to go and get extra rebounds, extra putbacks and then try to spike the glass for us on the defensive side of the ball. It's awesome to see the work that you have to put in to be able to do this.\"\n\nDespite the record, Reese made it clear that her performance left something wanting amid the loss against the Storm. It dropped the Sky to 8-12 overall.\n\n\"I think I didn't do enough tonight but just being able to be there for my teammates and knowing that I have a job to do no matter if I'm a rookie or a vet,\" Parker said.\n\nSeattle had a double-double from Nneka Ogwumike, who finished with 24 points and 13 rebounds. It didn't lead to a record as Reese's did, but the Storm had one milestone with Skylar Diggins-Smith hitting 4,500 career points and becoming 15th all-time in assists.\n\n\"We didn't even mention that in the locker room,\" Ogwumike told reporters. \"Those are two milestones we should have mentioned. It's no surprise.

Chicago stands as the No. 4 team in the Eastern Conference standings and No. 8 in the WNBA.\n\nAccording to multiple outlets, she is the leading candidate to win the league's Rookie of the Year award.\n\nHer Olympic aspirations are certainly within reach, given the WNBA's recent news that Reese will join the All-Star team in Phoenix, Arizona, on July 20.\n\nWeatherspoon made sure to back her rookie, explaining that Chicago would push Reese toward her goal.\n\nRelated: WNBA All-Star Angel Reese Reveals Major Career Goal\n\nRelated: Paige Bueckers Reveals Unexpected Pick For WNBA Rookie Of The Year", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_escarpio@postandcourier.com", "name": "Max Escarpio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Weatherspoon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Weatherspoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintrust_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wintrust Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WNBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paige_Bueckers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paige Bueckers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/a2/0a233635-bc89-52a6-b68d-b4240f7b63b3/668def91a9cea.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 1276, "textEnd": 1283}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The result, more and more comparisons between Reese and Parker, a player who Reese calls \"the GOAT.\"\n\n\"I've always respected CP3 and I even try to take some things from her game and try to add them to mine,\" Reese said following the Sky's loss to the Seattle Storm on Sunday. \"Being able to be named with an amazing player like that is always going to be special to me.\"\n\nIt's easy to see a few quick parallels between Reese and Parker. They're each highly talented power forwards who can score as easily as they collect rebounds, they each helped to propel the WNBA's popularity to new heights in their own eras, and they each have major ties to Chicago.\n\nParker grew up in Naperville and played for the Sky in 2020 and 2021. Reese has adopted Chicago as her new home.\n\nHowever, there's a particularly key part of Parker's career that Reese hopes will become another major comparison point between her and her role model.\n\n\"One thing I've always looked at her as, is a champion,\" Reese said. \"My big thing is to continue to be named with her, I want to win. Being able to come out and come to Chicago, rep for her city and bring a championship home is what's going to be important for me and what I look forward to.\"\n\nIt's clear that Reese enjoys her successes and that making WNBA history is important to her. She got visibly emotional when Sky head coach Teresa Weatherspoon announced Reese earned All-Star honors. But the main thing will always remain the main thing for her: winning.\n\n\"I'm just trying to be consistent for my teammates, doing whatever I can to help my team... I have a job to do every day, no matter if I'm a rookie or a vet.\"\n\nReese will continue to make headlines as she continues to develop as a pro. There's more history for her ahead, if she maintains the pace she's set over the first 20 games of the year.\n\nIf Reese keeps doing what she's doing, she'll shatter Yolanda Griffith's record for most offensive rebounds in a single season. Griffith pulled down 162 offensive boards in 2001. After Sunday's game, Reese has 97 offensive rebounds in 20 games, which put her on track for 194 this year.\n\nGriffith, another WNBA great, a Hall of Famer (and another Chicago native to boot!), mentioned alongside Reese in her rookie season. And Reese won't take it for granted.\n\n\"I'm grateful, lucky and blessed to be named along with these amazing players,\" Reese said. \"I've watched them all my life, and finally to be here in this moment to break their records and be up there with them is really cool. I've always given my flowers to them before me, because they laid the ground for me.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candace_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Candace Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naperville,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naperville, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Naperville, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yolanda_Griffith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yolanda Griffith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Weatherspoon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Weatherspoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eTdEY8AmAb.gbPPGS_Vc7Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04NDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnchicago.com/13cea76d49b19f849300579c612f7120", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

With Ogwumike and Jewell Loyd leading the charge, the Storm broke out on a 16-2 run to rally and take a five-point lead in the third quarter.\n\nThe Sky had no answer to the Storm's hot shooting, trailing by as much as 14 in the fourth quarter before orchestrating a 14-3 run to cut the deficit to three points with 2:49 remaining in the game.\n\nSeattle responded with a 12-0 run to close out the victory at Climate Pledge Arena. Ogwumike finished the game with 24 points and 13 rebounds, while Loyd added 20 points.\n\nMeanwhile, the 22-year-old Reese made history last week, after recording her 10th straight double-double in the team's loss to the Minnesota Lynx to pass Parker, who had nine straight at the end of the 2009 season for the most in a single season.\n\nThe two-time MVP Parker extended her streak to 12 total at the beginning of the 2010 season before Reese matched it on Friday night and then broke the record Sunday.\n\nReese entered Sunday night's game averaging 13.9 points, 11.7 rebounds and 1.4 steals per game so far in her rookie season.

However, star rookie forward Angel Reese continued her historical impact by amassing her 13th straight double-double. Fellow Sky teammate and starting guard Marina Mabrey was in awe of Reese's incredible accomplishment.\n\nReese broke Candace Parker's WNBA record for most consecutive double-doubles in league history, and Marina Mabrey gave the rookie forward high praise.\n\n\"I mean, it's a joy to watch,\" Mabrey said after the Storm loss. \"She's so consistent. She comes in every day and battle and is super physical for a rookie, which is really hard to do. That's usually one of the biggest transitions. And she kind of just jumped in their and got dirty, did all the dirty work, and now it's all paying off for her. And this is just the beginning. I'm excited to see where it goes.\"\n\nAngel Reese ended the matchup with 17 points, 14 rebounds, and four steals. Meanwhile, Marina Mabrey finished with 14 points, six assists, and five rebounds. Mabrey is proud of the work Reese is doing, but Reese is just as high on the support she receives from Mabrey and the rest of her teammates. Reese gave credit to her supporters and detailed the honor of being mentioned with WNBA legends.\n\n\"I think it's great for me being able to know where I'm at right now, and obviously, I'm not satisfied. I have coaches and teammates around me that believe in me... I'm grateful. I'm blessed and lucky to be named with these amazing players, and I know they've been super nice to me. They've always been helpful and inspiring to me, and I've watched them my entire life,\" Reese said after Sunday's game.\n\nAngel Reese, Sky do not plan on slowing down\n\nReese noted some key positives from Chicago's road trip despite their final loss to the Storm on Sunday. She believes the team can keep improving and achieve greater things.\n\n\"I think there were positives. We went 2-1 on the road, being able to endure a long stretch. I'm so proud of our team. I think we fought hard, and I know that 15 in the locker room, we wanted it more than anything. I believe in my sisters through whatever challenges we have,\" Reese shared.\n\nOne of the week's key improvements centered around Reese's outside shooting, She made her first two career three-pointers in the 88-84 July 5 win over the Storm. She provided insight into her newfound stroke after her impressive showing. Her growing confidence will continue to lead the way as the Sky look to stay in the playoff picture.\n\n\"This is what I do. I mean, all I needed was an opportunity. Being able to come to Chicago and being able to be a stretch four and being able to have teammates and coaches around me with confidence. They tell me all the time to shoot it, and a lot of times you'll see in the game I won't shoot it just for my own confidence. I know I can make it because I do it in practice and workouts. But tonight obviously gave me more of a confidence booster going into games knowing that I can make the shots.\"", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_smith@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Christopher Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Mabrey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marina Mabrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sky-news-Angel-Reese-draws-Marina-Mabrey-reaction-after-stunning-performance-vs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 2452, "textEnd": 2458}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

She tallied 17 points and 14 rebounds in the 84-71 defeat, earning her whopping 13th straight double-double to surpass all-time great Candace Parker and set a new WNBA record.\n\nReese is humbled to achieve such a feat, especially since she had to outdo a legend like the three-time champion and two-time MVP in order to reach this double-double mountaintop in her first season.\n\n\"She's the GOAT,\" Reese said of Parker after breaking her 14-year-old record, via the espnW Instagram account. \"Just being able to be named with an amazing player like that is always special to me.\"\n\nAlthough nobody else in the league can match the popularity of Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark, her fellow rookie and franchise pillar has been a prominent co-star during the 2024 campaign. Like Clark, Reese has helped her squad leap into the playoff picture while also etching her name in the history books. They are billed as future WNBA superstars, but they are both already undeniable faces of the league.\n\nThere is little time to enjoy the moment, however. Following a home matchup against the Atlanta Dream this Wednesday, the Sky will embark on a grueling stretch in which they battle the New York Liberty (twice) and the two-time defending champion Las Vegas Aces. Angel Reese will need to stay locked in and maintain this top form in order for Chicago to come out of that gauntlet feeling satisfied.\n\nJudging by her red-hot run, the 22-year-old appears to be up for the challenge. She has handled a substantial workload to this point, so more on-court adversity might just be further fuel for Reese.\n\nAngel Reese is leaving her mark in this landmark era for the WNBA\n\nThe No. 7 pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft has never been shy about announcing her presence in the sports or pop culture spheres, and she remains committed to building a lasting legacy. Leaping above Candace Parker is a surefire way to ensure that her game is not overshadowed by her brand.\n\nReese is posting 14.1 points, 11.9 rebounds and 1.5 steals (had four versus the Storm) per game this season, putting herself firmly in the Rookie of the Year conversation. A 41.8 field goal percentage leaves something to be desired for a forward, but the 2023 national champion is nevertheless making a significant impact on the Sky.\n\nIf she continues to fill up the stat sheets and help Chicago win games, then Angel Reese will keep hearing her name mentioned in the same breath as Parker and other WNBA legends.

According to Julia Poe, Reese mentioned that this is one of her biggest aspirations moving forward.\n\nReese was not included in the 2024 Olympics roster, but she will be taking her talents to the WNBA All-Star game on July 20 in Phoenix, Arizona. The young star will be joined by Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark as the only rookies on the same team since 2014.\n\nThe 22-year-old forward is currently averaging 14.1 points and a league-leading 11.9 rebounds per game. She's also the only rookie averaging a double-double, battling with Clark for the WNBA's Rookie of the Year award.\n\nClark has posted 16.1 points and 7.4 assists, leading all rookies in both categories.\n\nReese's Olympic hopes seem very practical. She's already established herself as one of the best rebounders in the game, and her offensive skill set has improved as the season has progressed.\n\nShe's shooting 41.8% from the field and 25% from three-point range, struggling with efficiency, but those numbers have risen throughout the year.\n\nThe LSU rookie recently notched the WNBA record for the most consecutive double-doubles, grabbing her 13th straight with a 17-point, 14-rebound performance in an 84-71 loss to the Seattle Storm.\n\nReese passed Candace Parker to secure WNBA history. Parker had recorded 12 double-doubles in a row between the 2009 and 2010 seasons.\n\nThere hasn't been a more consistent rookie in the league than Reese, who serves as Chicago's anchor in the painted area. If Reese can continue this level of production, her Olympic goals surely seem attainable.\n\nRelated: LeBron James Made His Opinion Of Simone Biles Extremely Clear\n\nRelated: Paige Bueckers Reveals Unexpected Pick For WNBA Rookie Of The Year", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_escarpio@postandcourier.com", "name": "Max Escarpio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintrust_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wintrust Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WNBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paige_Bueckers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paige Bueckers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candace_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Candace Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/5c/d5c3f859-5465-5f59-b147-871569f4c2be/668def933e5a5.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C81&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 531, "textEnd": 538}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Storm guard Jewell Loyd scored 20 points in the victory.\n\nReese's 14 total double-doubles in 2024 are tied for the fifth-most during a rookie campaign.

Clark leads all rookies with 16.1 points and 7.4 assists per game, while Reese ranks No. 2 in terms of points per game by a rookie with 14.1 and leads the league with 11.9 rebounds per contest.\n\nRelated: WNBA All-Star Angel Reese Reveals Major Career Goal\n\nRelated: Chicago Sky Coach Sends Firm Message To Angel Reese On Olympic Goals", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_escarpio@postandcourier.com", "name": "Max Escarpio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintrust_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wintrust Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/96/896eed37-00f3-55c3-bec1-f6f757f1f19e/668e78900e4f8.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 376, "textEnd": 383}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-06-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 7}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The two combined for 24 of the Sky's 43 rebounds. After the game, Cardoso regurgitated the warning she sent the league when she and Reese were both drafted by the Sky.\n\n\"When I got drafted I said, 'Nobody's going to get rebounds over us when me and Angel are together,'\" Cardoso said after the game.\n\nFunny enough, it took Reese the final seconds of the game to earn her double-double on Wednesday, which also marked her 14th consecutive double-double.\n\nWith time running down on the Sky's 78-69 victory over the Dream, Chennedy Carter was ready to dribble out the clock. But the Sky crowd got on their feet and implored her to get the ball to Reese to give her a shot to cross the double-digit point barrier to extend her 13-game double-double streak.\n\nCarter quickly handed the ball to Marina Mabrey, who lobbed a pass into the post for Reese. Reese backed down her defender and was fouled, giving her two chances at the line to get over nine points, which she cashed in.\n\nAfter the game, Carter joked about getting help from the crowd and the bench to get the ball to Reese.\n\n\"I told my team when I got in the locker room I was like 'I'm glad y'all told me because I was ready to go coast-to-coast to the rim,'\" Carter said. \"But then I looked and Angel was sealing and I was like 'Oh!'

Her performances have been a leading factor in the Sky's competitive season and have drawn praise from across the league, including being named the WNBA's June Rookie of the Month.\n\nSeattle, which had an eight-game home winning streak snapped by the Sky two days prior on July 5, faced the challenge of containing Reese. Known for her dominance on the offensive glass, Reese leads the league in both offensive and total rebounds. Quinn emphasized the need for a collective effort to counter her impact.\n\n\"We have to gang rebound,\" Quinn said. \"A player like that who just goes to the glass with heart, desire, athleticism, strength, it's hard to neutralize.\"\n\nDespite their best efforts, the Storm struggled to contain Reese and her 6-foot-7 teammate Kamilla Cardoso, who grabbed five offensive boards in the first quarter alone. The Storm also had difficulty scoring inside, going 3 of 15 in the paint during the first quarter.\n\nHowever, led by standout performances from Skylar Diggins-Smith and Jewell Loyd, Seattle managed to rally. Diggins-Smith inspired the team with back-to-back threes early in the second quarter, giving the Storm their first lead of the game. Loyd, after a quiet first half, erupted in the third quarter with 12 points, helping to push the Storm ahead for good.\n\nThe Sky have four games left before the WNBA All-Star Game, where Reese is set to play for Team USA, as well as the month-long break for the Paris Olympics.\n\nRelated: WNBA Reveals All-Star Game Jerseys with a Surprising Twist\n\nRelated: Seattle Storm Star Surpasses 2 WNBA Milestones During Game vs. Chicago Sky", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noelle_Quinn", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noelle Quinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seattle_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Seattle Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewell_Loyd", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jewell Loyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylar_Diggins-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skylar Diggins-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/b5/ab562cd6-8f44-5d9d-ae35-c8124208947e/668c3494e2930.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 861, "textEnd": 867}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

breaking the double-double streak record held by Candace Parker.\n\nIt was then that it became clear another microphone had been mistakenly left on.\n\n\"[Are we] ever going to have an intimate

while coach Teresa Weatherspoon and teammate Marina Mabrey also seemed unsure of where all this was going.\n\n\"I told you they were being weird on that,\" Mabrey said, laughing.\n\n\"Oooo they finna

As impressive as it sounds, the rookie surpassed Candace Parker's previous record for most consecutive double-doubles in league history with her 17-14 outing.\n\nReese had been pretty much sidelined at the beginning of the WNBA season by the growing popularity of Caitlin Clark in the league. But her consistency and hustle for her team have hurled her back into the limelight.\n\nHowever, Reese breaking Candace Parker's record of 12 consecutive double-doubles in her rookie season will certainly make her a frontrunner in the ROTY race. It will now be interesting to see how long she can continue her streak of double-doubles.\n\nAs expected, the former LSU Tiger received several compliments while being compared to the Hall-Of-Famer whose record she just broke. Responding to a reporter, Reese was quite humble while talking about Parker's greatness and the comparisons people were making.\n\n\"She's (Candace Parker) the GOAT. I've had conversations with her, her family, her mom before I even came to Chicago. I've always respected CP3 and I try to even just take some things from her game and try to add them to mine.

There's no other way to put it,\" Carter stated. \"She goes out, she does her work every single night, no matter what team we're facing. I'm telling you, Barbie's Rookie of the Year, for sure.\"\n\nReese's impact extends beyond her individual performance. The Sky's June 23 game against the Caitlin Clark-led Indiana Fever drew an average of 2.3 million viewers, making it the most-watched WNBA game in over two decades, as reported by Sportico.\n\nAs Reese prepares to showcase her skills in the 2024 WNBA All-Star game on July 20 in Phoenix, the debate over who deserves the Rookie of the Year title continues. Caitlin Clark, another standout rookie, is often mentioned alongside Reese. Celebrated journalist Monica McNutt has voiced her preference for Reese, citing team standings as a critical factor. \"I have said this all season because my Rookie of the Year is going to go based on the standings because I think that is how you have the opportunity to measure impact,\" McNutt stated on ESPN's Get Up. \"And the Sky is right above them, and the Sky right now are in the playoffs. So you'd have to give the nod in my mind to Angel Reese.\"\n\nWith Reese's record-breaking performance and significant contributions to her team's success, the question remains: will it be enough to secure her the Rookie of the Year title? As the season progresses, fans and analysts alike will be watching closely as Reese continues her remarkable journey and earns the recognition she deserves.", "source": {"uri": "atlantadailyworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Atlanta Daily World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennedy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chennedy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_McNutt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monica McNutt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://atlantadailyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/06/IMG_3045-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 437, "textEnd": 443}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 486, "textEnd": 492}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-23", "textStart": 1809, "textEnd": 1816}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 2065, "textEnd": 2072}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The Chicago Sky forward often posts on both X and Instagram to share updates about her personal life and even engage with fans. On Monday, however, she turned a lot of heads with what could be her best social media post yet.\n\nOn X, Reese shared several photos of her pregame outfit--a denim top and skirt--from Sunday's battle with the Seattle Storm. The Sky All-Star then went on to caption it with an awesome wordplay referring to her double-double streak.\n\n\"i loveeee me a double double but i've never been a rebound,\" Reese wrote along with a winking face emoji.\n\nAgainst the Storm, Angel Reese broke Candace Parker's WNBA record for the most consecutive double-doubles with 13. She has simply been a rebounding monster as well, with her current averages of 11.9 boards actually leading the whole WNBA--not just among rookies.\n\nWith that being said, her caption was definitely perfect and delightfully playful. For those not in the know, \"rebound\"--in dating that is--refers to someone who rushes into a relationship despite having not fully moved on from the previous one.\n\nSure enough, fans loved her message.

She is not only racking in a lot of fans but also outperforming expectations on the floor. Her squad is up against the Jewell Lloyd-led Seattle Storm. While their eight-win record does not say much, the rookie is leading her team in putting up a fight. Her legendary run even helped her notch a record that only the great Candace Parker ever touched.\n\nAngel Reese scored her 13th straight double-double against the Storm. This breaks her tie with Candace Parker for most double-doubles over multiple seasons, per the WNBA.\n\nThe Sky rookie had already been instrumental to her squad in their 88-84 win against the Jewell Lloyd-led Storm. But, she came out swinging more aggressively this time around. In 30 minutes of action, she has managed to knock down six out of her 11 shots from the field. This has netted her 13 points midway into the third quarter.\n\nWhile none of her three-pointers have fallen just yet, Angel Reese is making sure that her efforts are still felt in other departments of the game. Her rebounding prowess is on display as usual. The Sky rookie has 10 rebounds on the defensive end alone. She also cleaned up the boards on offense twice for a grand total of 12 boards. This was not the only defensive effort that she gave. Her hops have seen her meet Jewell Lloyd at the apex of the latter's shot for a block during the third quarter.\n\nNot to mention, the Sky rookie's elite tracking of the ball mixed with some hasty calls from the Storm in the passing lane has been a delight to watch. Reese now has four steals just because of this and could be giving her team a prime opportunity to come back. Truly, she looks like Candace Parker but in a Sky jersey.\n\nSky face a formidable foe in the Storm\n\nWhile Reese started looking like Candace Parker early on, the Storm just wanted one thing and that was to win. Lloyd and Nneka Ogwumike are making sure that is exactly what happens as her squad tries to get the 14th entry in the win column. This duo for the Storm has combined for 40 points so far and is not looking to slow down any time soon.\n\nLloyd, while cold from outside with a one-of-six shooting stroke, has still contributed positively. She has 17 points in the game and has dropped four assists. Ogwumike, on the other hand, is putting on a clinic on how to play winning basketball.

That's also despite a fast start for the Sky, which built a 20-12 first-quarter lead.\n\nChicago kept in front by eight points at halftime, 39-31, but the Storm pulled in front during the third quarter with a 29-point effort. Jewell Lloyd put the Storm ahead on a basket, 44-42, and Nneka Ogwumike made a three-point play off of a foul by Reese.\n\nThe Storm put their foot on the gas after that by attacking the basket on a 12-0 run. Jordan Horston and Ogwumike hit free throws, Ezi Magbegor made a layup, and Skylar Diggins-Smith hit a three-pointer in addition to a free-throw to get the run going.

She tied Parker in Friday's 88-84 win over the Storm with a career-high 27 points and 10 boards.\n\nLast week, Reese overtook Parker for the league's longest single-season streak with her 10th double-double in a row. She set the mark as a 22-year-old rookie, while Parker was 29 and in her eighth season when she began her consecutive double-doubles streak.\n\nReese set the rookie record with seven consecutive double-doubles when she scored 16 points with 18 rebounds on June 20 versus the Dallas Wings, topping the mark set by Tina Charles (2010, with the Sun) and Cindy Brown (1998, Detroit Shock).\n\nHas Reese's record streak helped her gain ground in the WNBA Rookie of the Year race? Teammate Chennedy Carter said after Friday's game that she's already earned the award. Reese came into the game leading the WNBA in rebounds, averaging 11.7 per game.\n\nCarter scored 21 points for the Sky, who dropped to 8-12 with the loss. Marina Mabrey added 12 points with four rebounds and six assists, while Cardoso tallied eight rebounds.\n\nThe Storm improved to 14-7 for the season despite a very slow start, shooting 29% in the first half (21% in the first quarter) But they recovered impressively to finish at 42% for the game.\n\nNneka Ogwumike led Seattle with 24 points and got her own double-double with 13 rebounds.

Angel Reese comes to Teresa Weatherspoon's rescue with tough message: That's one thing I don't tolerate at all\n\nAngel Reese has been criticized on a number of occasions throughout her rookie season in the WNBA, most notably for dirty plays, and there was another example of such an incident in Tuesday's clash with the Atlanta Dream.\n\nReese made headlines with a massive block against Dream forward Cheyenne Parker-Tyus during the game, although many felt it was too forceful, verging on a dirty and nasty play.\n\nReese initially got boxed out of the paint after Parker-Tyus secured a position. Despite being backed down, Reese soared over the 6-foot-3 forward for a huge block, which led to a fastbreak opportunity for the Sky.\n\nAfter the block, the former LSU standout stared down Parker-Tyus before heading back to the offensive end, much to the ire of those who felt the block wasn't legal.\n\nReese has arguably been Chicago's best all-around player this season. Averaging 14.1 points per game, she ranks second in scoring on the team while leading with 11.9 rebounds and 1.5 steals per game.\n\nHer 11.9 rebounds make her the league leader in average boards. Reese's tenacity, especially in the paint, has defined her career, but she can't let it go too far.\n\nReese continues to improve, recording two or more blocks in three of the last four games. As she becomes more comfortable halfway through her rookie season, she's finding easier defensive reads.\n\nReese is currently competing with Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark for the league's Rookie of the Year award.\n\nWhile Clark leads all rookies with 16.1 points and 7.4 assists, Reese's versatility might give her an edge in the race for the trophy.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/9d0d69e29471adf746deb300aa4cf3ee/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/07/10/17206364178248.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Led by Angel Reese, Marina Mabrey and Chennedy Carter, the Sky have become an intriguing team to bet on, even though they are just 8-11 ATS and 4-8 ATS as underdogs in the 2024 season.\n\nLet's break down the odds, key players to watch and a best bet for this rematch on Sunday.\n\nAngel Reese: Reese's Rookie of the Year candidacy looks stronger and stronger each day, as the No. 7 overall pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft dropped 27 points and 10 rebounds on Friday night in a win over the Storm. Reese is now averaging 13.9 points, 11.7 rebounds and 1.9 assists per game while shooting 41.0 percent from the field.\n\nSeattle Storm\n\nJewell Loyd: Loyd's inconsistency has hurt the Storm this season, as she's shooting just 36.6 percent from the field, and was 0-for-6 from 3 in the loss to Chicago on Friday. Loyd did have three games of 26 or more points before Friday's loss, so she may be primed for a bounce-back game on Sunday.\n\nSky vs. Storm Prediction and Pick\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to bet on Seattle at home (8-2 straight up, 7-3 against the spread), but I can't do it at this number on Sunday.\n\nThese teams have already matched up twice this season, and Chicago has kept it within 10 points each time, losing on May 28 by nine (without rookie Kamilla Cardoso) before winning Friday's matchup by four.\n\nOverall, the Sky have just two losses by double digits all season - one to the New York Liberty and one to the Las Vegas Aces.\n\nThat's extremely impressive for a younger team, and the Sky have shown night in and night out that they can compete with just about anyone in the W.\n\nI would be shocked to see Seattle drop back-to-back games at home, especially since it remains one of the top teams in the league in offensive, defensive and net rating, but this is a few too many points for my liking.\n\nChicago has a massive advantage in the painted area, where the Storm allow the second most points per game, and I think that will allow the Sky to hang around even if they end up losing on Sunday.\n\nPick: Sky +9.5 (-112)\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800-GAMBLER.\n\nFind Peter Dewey's WNBA betting record here (futures included).

Here's one way to look at it", "body": "One would like to think we have far more important things to hate on one another about.\n\nWhich side of Chicago has the best beef sandwiches.\n\nBut, no, nothing throws a match on a mountain of combustibility quite like raising the topic of WNBA rookie sensations Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. Or, sorry, should that be Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark?\n\nIt doesn't matter -- either order you put their names in, it's already too late to stop the flames of righteous anger and bounding brainlessness from spreading.\n\nA problem we have in our society is that we don't know how to disagree about anything, not even a trifling matter such as Reese vs. Clark, Clark vs. Reese. People get so excited to insert themselves into the argument du jour, they start lobbing rhetorical grenades at the other side without having even begun to read, listen or consider. Thus, the nastiness of the rhetoric -- even about a pair of 22-year-old basketball players playing their tails off -- erupts almost instantly and irrevocably.\n\nAnd everyone involved gets a little bit stupider, every time.\n\nThe latest on the WNBA front is a crackling fire -- it'll inevitably become a conflagration -- about which of the two superstar newcomers deserves to be at the front of the race for rookie of the year. Indeed, it is a two-player race, with the Sky's Reese on a league-record streak of 13 straight double-doubles, the Fever's Clark packing the stats sheet despite every perimeter defender with a pulse lining up for a chance to take her rock and, just telling it like it is, no other rookie even worthy of being in the conversation.\n\nIt's also the latest reminder that every time one is foolish enough to wade into a public debate about these two players, the experience is as educational and illuminating as a lobotomy.\n\nLast weekend, after Reese had rung up her 12th straight double-double in a win against the Storm in Seattle, the Sun-Times' Sky reporter and chief WNBA expert, Annie Costabile, wrote about the rookie of the year race and opined that Reese had earned the edge at midseason.\n\n\"It's hard to argue against,\" Costabile wrote.\n\n\"[Reese] is rookie of the year,\" Sky teammate Chennedy Carter said in the story. \"There's no other way to put it.\"\n\nIf only those sentiments were true, society might be a tad more bearable. Alas, arguments -- any arguments -- are irresistible and far too many people are quick to find \"other ways\" to put things that invoke insults, slurs and other forms of outright ignorance right off the top.\n\nDespite knowing better, I looked at the comments under the Sun-Times' Facebook posting of this story. Like a dope who slathers himself in tree sap before breaking open a hornets' nest, I got what I deserved -- and that's referring to merely reading the comments, not even contributing to them.\n\nThe first person to comment on the story could not have been less provocative or inflammatory, pointing out Clark's and Reese's individual strengths and saying both will be fun to watch in the All-Star Game in Phoenix later this month. Yet that comment was all it took to unleash unpleasantness and hate.\n\nThe first to reply called Clark a \"better teammate\" and \"better for the league.\" In a blink, Reese was being called \"unsportsmanlike,\" \"trashy,\" without humility and worse. More than one fool said or insinuated that Reese will win the award because she's Black and that suits the league's social agenda.\n\nBut even some who commented in support of Clark without tearing down Reese were labeled as \"haters.\" Clark was mocked as a \"savior.\" Someone even likened her to former NBA player Sam Bowie, who infamously was drafted by the Trail Blazers in 1984 before a rather talented kid from North Carolina slipped to the Bulls. The implication being Reese is Michael Jordan? OK, sure.\n\nI stopped reading the comments before long. Suffice it to say, they were too much like the discourse whenever Clark and Reese come up in the context of each other.\n\nYou know what would be a breath of fresh air? If we could talk about these two -- about basketball -- without keeping one eye peeled for an incoming grenade. Is it really too much to ask for?\n\nI'm going to admit a few things here.\n\nOne, Clark is the huge favorite on betting sites to win rookie of the year. I'm not sure there's even a debate about who will win the award. Debate about \"should\" if you want to, but it's kind of beside the point.\n\nTwo, the excitement and hype from WNBA circles over Reese's double-doubles is a tad puzzling. No one has had 13 in a row before, so it's clearly a terrific accomplishment. On the other hand, hearing such a hubbub over double-doubles is unusual, isn't it? Reese is averaging 14.1 points and 11.9 rebounds in 31.5 minutes, very strong production -- but nobody threw the Kings' Domantas Sabonis a parade for his NBA-leading 77 double-doubles this past season. The Bulls' Nikola Vucevic has averaged a double-double each season in Chicago as well as over his nine-year career -- 17.1 points and 10.5 boards in 31.4 minutes -- yet fans here can hardly stand watching him under-deliver.\n\nThree, Clark is averaging 16.1 points and misfiring on more than two-thirds of her three-point shots. She has been really good but also really human, while Reese is the one who's over-delivering. If Clark were scoring even a bucket a game more, there might not be any debate at all, but the Caitlin Show hasn't exactly been a non-stop thrill ride.", "source": {"uri": "chicago.suntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Sun-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie_of_the_Year_(award)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie of the Year (award)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennedy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chennedy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bowie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bowie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Vu\u010devi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domantas_Sabonis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domantas Sabonis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Trail_Blazers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portland Trail Blazers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04e5293/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4105x2343+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F66%2F67%2Fc6d356f543939721a2426dcfabe4%2Fgettyimages-2157848123.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Marina Mabrey caused a turnover on the other end and passed the ball to Reese, who solidified her double-double in the closing moments.\n\nCardoso added 11 rebounds for a double-double as well.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nChicago moved to 9-12 with the victory and Atlanta fell to 7-14.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_gaydos@foxnews.com", "name": "Ryan Gaydos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennedy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennedy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanisha_Wright", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tanisha Wright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jump ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Evans_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dana Evans (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Mabrey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marina Mabrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Badminton", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Badminton", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Multi-Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Multi-Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/07/1024/512/Angel-Reese5.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Led by Angel Reese, Marina Mabrey and Chennedy Carter, the Sky have become an intriguing team to bet on, even though they are just 8-11 ATS and 4-8 ATS as underdogs in the 2024 season.\n\nLet's break down the odds, key players to watch and a best bet for this rematch on Sunday.\n\nAngel Reese: Reese's Rookie of the Year candidacy looks stronger and stronger each day, as the No. 7 overall pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft dropped 27 points and 10 rebounds on Friday night in a win over the Storm. Reese is now averaging 13.9 points, 11.7 rebounds and 1.9 assists per game while shooting 41.0 percent from the field.\n\nJewell Loyd: Loyd's inconsistency has hurt the Storm this season, as she's shooting just 36.6 percent from the field, and was 0-for-6 from 3 in the loss to Chicago on Friday. Loyd did have three games of 26 or more points before Friday's loss, so she may be primed for a bounce-back game on Sunday.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to bet on Seattle at home (8-2 straight up, 7-3 against the spread), but I can't do it at this number on Sunday.\n\nThese teams have already matched up twice this season, and Chicago has kept it within 10 points each time, losing on May 28 by nine (without rookie Kamilla Cardoso) before winning Friday's matchup by four.\n\nOverall, the Sky have just two losses by double digits all season - one to the New York Liberty and one to the Las Vegas Aces.\n\nThat's extremely impressive for a younger team, and the Sky have shown night in and night out that they can compete with just about anyone in the W.\n\nI would be shocked to see Seattle drop back-to-back games at home, especially since it remains one of the top teams in the league in offensive, defensive and net rating, but this is a few too many points for my liking.\n\nChicago has a massive advantage in the painted area, where the Storm allow the second most points per game, and I think that will allow the Sky to hang around even if they end up losing on Sunday.\n\nPick: Sky +9.5 (-112)\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennedy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chennedy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewell_Loyd", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jewell Loyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Mabrey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marina Mabrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Aces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Aces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5000,h_2812,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j271yemaddsh2xhz27.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 1662, "textEnd": 1668}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

ESPN expert weighs in on whether Caitlin Clark or Angel Reese should be Rookie of the Year\n\nChicago Sky rookie Angel Reese is having a wonderful first season as a rookie, she is struggling much less than Caitlin Clark to get adapted to the league. Reese has managed to get herself into the conversation for the Rookie of the Year Award as she has also cemented her place inside the Chicago Sky's roster. Right now, many even consider sheis having a season in par with the legendary Candace Parker when she first arrived to the WNBA. But that doesn't take her eye from the ball, Angel Reese confessed recently she doesn't really care about personal accolades. Given how much attention she has been getting alongside Caitlin Clark, we can't help but think about the early '1980s.\n\nAlthough it's still hard to say which of both rookies will make it to the WNBA Finals, it is pretty clear to see many similarities between these two rookies and the two rookies who single handedly revived the NBA back in the '1980s. They created the blueprint forhow to turn an entire league into one of the most profitable businesses in American sports history. Larry Bird and Magic Johnson were the formula to follow. Both Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark are trying to replicate that but it's not even on purpose. During that first season, Magic Johnson ended up winning his first NBA Championship with the Lakers while Bird won the Rookie of the Year Award.\n\nRight now, Angel Reese seems better positioned to win the individual accolade. However, none of both rookies has their team in a great position. Currently, other teams like the New York Liberty, the Connecticut Sun, and two thirds of the Western Conference have better results than their teams. All Reese or Clark can consider winning is the ROY award. Here's what Angel told reporters about this prize: \"I'm not thinking about Rookie of the Year.

It's a lofty aspiration for the young star, but one that her coach, Teresa Weatherspoon, wholeheartedly supports.\n\n\"If that is her goal, we're going to push her toward it,\" Weatherspoon said, per Julia Poe.

It's a significant milestone that not only highlights her talent but also sets the stage for her future aspirations.\n\nWeatherspoon, a seasoned advocate for her players, emphasizes that Chicago will support Reese every step of the way. \"We're committed to helping her achieve her dreams,\" she reiterated.

Find out why our WNBA betting picks think the talented rookie will rack up the rebounds for the Chicago Sky today.\n\nA recent four-game slide has the Atlanta Dream on the playoff outs. They'll try to turn things around vs. a team that's jumped them in the standings when they visit the Chicago Sky on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nDespite being tied for the fewest home wins in the league, Chicago is a six-point home favorite in the WNBA odds.\n\nOur Dream vs. Sky predictions and free WNBA picks are focused on a rookie absolutely cleaning glass for the home team.\n\nChicago Sky forward Angel Reese has solidified her standing in the WNBA after recording a league-best 13th double-double of the season in just her 20th game as a pro. The seventh pick of the WNBA Draft scored 17 points and grabbed 14 boards last time out, though Chicago came up on the wrong end of an 84-71 score.\n\nOne of four players in the league currently averaging double figures in rebounding, Reese leads the W at 11.9 boards per contest, including nearly five offensive rebounds per game (4.9). That's nearly 1.5 clear of her nearest competitor, teammate Kamille Cardoso. Ezi Magbegor of the Seattle Storm is the only other player to touch three offensive boards per contest.\n\nAfter picking up just one 10+ rebound game in her first six, Reese has gone the next 14 straight games with at least 10 boards. Reese's line for Wednesday is set at what feels like a steep 12.5 rebounds, until you look at the stats and see the Sky big has topped that total eight times in the last 11 contests.\n\nShe has been dominant against the Atlanta Dream in two previous matchups. Most recently, she set a new career high by pulling down 19 rebounds to go along with 12 points in an 85-77 win on July 2. Previously, Reese went for 13 points, 13 boards (and five steals!) in an 89-80 loss on June 8.\n\nAtlanta is a middle-of-the-pack rebounding team, but they won't be a match for Reese, who is already among the most dominant big players in the league.\n\nDream vs Sky same-game parlay (SGP)\n\nThe injury bug is hitting the Dream in a big way, with guards Jordin Canada (finger) and Rhyne Howard (ankle) joining Laeticia Amihere (international commitment) and Aerial Powers (calf) already on the sideline.\n\nOne guard who will be available is Allisha Gray, and she has a very hittable Over of 1.5 made 3s against the Sky. She's gone Under that total in two straight games, but she's hit the mark twice against Chicago. On July 2, Gray went 3-for-7 from distance en route to 19 points. In Chicago, she finished 2-for-4 from 3-point range, part of a 14-point performance.\n\nLet's wrap up this SGP with the Sky on the spread. Atlanta has dropped 11 of its last 14, and those losses haven't been particularly close, covering the spread just once.\n\nWith the Dream's injury woes, there's not much more offense that can be delivered for a team that is already last in the WNBA in scoring at 75 points per game.

But, while Clark was the undisputed favorite not too long ago, Reese's stock seems to be on the up at the moment. Amidst the positivity around her camp, former NBA man Jeff Teague has compared the Chicago Sky rookie to an NBA legend. Unfortunately for her, however, it wasn't exactly for the best reason.\n\nReese averages 11.9 rebounds per game. Without a doubt, this is beyond impressive. However, it is a bit important to note that it can be her own misses at the rim that she rebounds. So, the number is a bit inflated.\n\nReferencing just this, Jeff Teague explained that this is exactly how Moses Malone padded his numbers, which is why he believes Angel Reese is beyond similar to the 76ers legend.\n\n\"I ain't going to lie, she do miss a lot and get the rebound. They call that the Moses Malone rule... I'm just saying, you watch her, she miss a lot!\" [He said on the Club 520 Podcast]\n\nDespite what he said about Reese's game, Teague admitted that for him, she is now the favorite to win the WNBA Rookie of the Year award. So, it's clear that the former NBA man is not dismissive of the Sky rookie's efforts this season. However, because he has been watching her so closely, he sees her faults and flair. And of course, Jeff has never been the kind of person to shy away from the truth.\n\nAll things considered, it is clear that Angel Reese has stepped it up a notch. The 22-year-old is averaging 14.1 points, 11.9 rebounds, and 1.9 assists per game. She is also shooting 41.8% from the field, a number that has improved with each passing game this season.\n\nThere seems to have been a moment where it all seemed to click for the former LSU Tiger. She has even already surpassed Candace Parker's record for consecutive double-doubles in a season, something she revealed her thoughts on very recently.\n\nDuring her career, Candace Parker set a record for consecutive games with double-doubles, at 12. Recently, Reese broke that very record in just her rookie season, by notching her 13th consecutive double-double.\n\nLater, she was asked to comment on what was on her mind after this incredible achievement. To this, she held no emotion back, saying the following to ESPN,\n\n\"She [Candace Parker] is the GOAT. I've had conversations with her, her family, her mom. I've talked to them before I even came to Chicago, and built that relationship before, and I've always respected CP. I try to even take some things from her game and try to add them to mine. Just being able to be named with amazing player like that is just always going to be special to me.\"\n\nBeing a WNBA great, perhaps Candace Parker gave Angel Reese a few pointers on how she could improve her game. And as a result, the 22-year-old may end up becoming far greater than any other player in the league's history.\n\nBut before all of that, the Chicago Sky star will be looking to grab the Rookie of the Year award before a certain rival of hers can get her hands on it.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tonoy_sengupta@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Tonoy Sengupta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moses Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candace_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Candace Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/07/a935b920-untitled-design-26.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

One reporter tried to ask Angel Reese a question about her performance, during which she logged a record 13th consecutive double-double, but an unlikely source interrupted the reporter several times.\n\nWhat was the source of the interruption? Some rather serious-sounding audio from the popular sitcom \"The Big Bang Theory.\"\n\nHere's what to know about Reese's comical press conference.\n\nMORE: Angel Reese surpasses Candance Parker with 13th consecutive double-double\n\nReese's news conference began with a reporter attempting to ask the rookie a question about her record double-double streak continuing. However, the reporter was interrupted by a female voice, who said, \"Are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?\"\n\nReese, who was mildly confused, responded, saying, \"I'm sorry, the last part cut off.\"\n\nThen came a response from a male voice, who said, \"Oh my, that's an uncomfortable topic.\"\n\nAt that point, Reese -- along with her teammate Marina Mabrey and coach Teresa Weatherspoon -- appeared confused.\n\n\"Excuse me?\" she asked, as those running the media availability attempted to clarify the question.\n\nThat was followed by a line that shocked Reese and Mabrey, who appeared to be trying not to laugh.\n\n\"I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone,\" the male voice said.\n\nAfter that, the rogue audio cut out, and the news conference continued.\n\nIt's easy to understand why the Sky thought they had awkwardly stumbled upon a private and personal conversation. In reality, they were hearing audio from an episode of \"The Big Bang Theory\" that had inadvertently been funneled into the Zoom call by Chicago TV station WGN, as reported by the Chicago Tribune's Julia Poe.\n\nMORE: Complete rosters, voting results for 2024 WNBA All-Star Game\n\nIn the scene -- from the 23rd episode of season six, \"The Love Spell Potential\" -- Amy Farrah Fowler (portrayed by Mayim Bialik) is having a serious discussion with her long-time boyfriend, Sheldon Cooper (played by Jim Parsons).\n\nAmy questions whether she will get what she wants from her relationship with Sheldon. Eventually, Sheldon admits he has \"not ruled out\" being intimate with Amy, despite his apprehensions about the topic, marking a big moment -- and stepping stone -- in their relationship.\n\nAudiences typically view the moment as heartwarming, vulnerable and comical, as Amy responds to Sheldon's declaration by saying, \"Wow, talk dirty to me.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Reese and Co. didn't get to hear the end of the scene, so they didn't immediately know the scene's touching conclusion.\n\nStill, the Sky will settle for the laughs they got out of the unusual news conference gaffe.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Mabrey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marina Mabrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Big Bang Theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Weatherspoon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Weatherspoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Farrah_Fowler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amy Farrah Fowler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayim_Bialik", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayim Bialik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGN-TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WGN-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-07/Angel%20Reese%2C%20Jim%20Parasons%20070824.png?itok=AZCn_DeS", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

On Sunday (July 7), the rookie sensation recorded her 13th consecutive double-double of the year, setting a new mark and breaking Candace Parker's 2009/10 record in the process.\n\nReese accomplished the feat in the Chicago Sky's game against the Seattle Storm, losing 71-84. The Chi-Town Barbie finished the match with 17 points with 14 rebounds, etching her name in the league's history books.\n\nAngel's record-breaking performance has also pushed her overall year stats into historical territory, hitting 275 points, 225 rebounds, and 30 steals in 20 games. Yolanda Griffith is the only other player to reach similar numbers in 19 games in 1999.\n\n\"I'm just trying to be consistent for my teammates, doing whatever I can to help my team,\" Reese told ESPN reporters after the game. \"I think I didn't do enough tonight, but just being able to be there for my teammates and knowing that I have a job to do every day, no matter if I'm a rookie or a vet.\"\n\nSky coach Teresa Weatherspoon spoke of the star and how she has already made an impact on her team. Coach Weatherspoon stated that, while it may be shocking for Angel to see what she can do at the pro level, it was never an unexpected outcome for her and her coaching staff -- they knew the greatness that Angel possessed.\n\n\"It's absolutely amazing to see,\" first-year head coach Teresa Weatherspoon said of Reese's feat. \"She might be surprising herself, but she's not surprising me. It's something that she can do because it's something that she puts the work in to be able to do.

Not only did the rookie forward tally an impressive 17 points and 14 rebounds, clinching her 13th consecutive double-double and surpassing Candace Parker's decade-old record, but she also unveiled a bold new look that's got everyone talking.\n\nOn July 8, Reese took to Instagram Stories to reveal her latest transformation. Known for her long locks, the 22-year-old LSU alum switched things up with a sleek new bob. It's a look that's as fierce as her gameplay and has fans buzzing. In a league where style off the court can be as influential as stats on the court, Reese is proving she's got both in spades.\n\nReese's new hairstyle is more than a fashion statement; it's a declaration. It's as if she's saying, \"Watch me change the game-and look good doing it.\" The bob is a chic, confident look that matches her on-court persona: bold, unyielding, and ready to make history.\n\nThis record-breaking performance isn't just a testament to her talent but also her relentless work ethic. \"It's absolutely amazing to see,\" Sky head coach Teresa Weatherspoon said of Reese's accomplishment. \"She might be surprising herself, but she's not surprising me. It's something that she can do because it's something that she puts the work in to be able to do.

With tonight's total as low as 163, if they can even shoot moderately better from distance -- which we expect -- the Over is the play.\n\nThe Seattle Storm and Chicago Sky collide for the second time in three days, and we should be in for a treat if tonight's contest mirrors Friday's matchup. Whoever wins, our Sky vs. Storm predictions expect more offensive fireworks.\n\nAngel Reese and the Sky held on for an 88-84 victory that night, snapping the Storm's four-game win streak, but Seattle is pegged as the clear favorite in the latest WNBA odds.\n\nI weigh up the key betting angles for this July 7 showdown in my free WNBA picks.\n\nAfter shooting a league-worst 41% from the field in 2023, the Seattle Storm have bounced back in style this season, averaging 84 points per game and trailing only the Las Vegas Aces and New York Liberty in that category. With Jewell Loyd and Nneka Ogwumike at the forefront, Seattle is a threat against even the WNBA's best defenses.\n\nWhile the Chicago Sky can't compete with the Storm's level of shot-making, they held their own in a high-scoring matchup earlier this week, shooting 47% overall and producing a 30-point third quarter.\n\nOne common theme between these teams makes the Over the most attractive play on the board tonight: they both love to jack shots up. Seattle and Chicago are locked together at the top of the charts for most field-goal attempts per game, averaging 71 apiece.\n\nThat strongly suggests we will see the two offenses show up. The Over is 8-2 in the Sky's past 10 games, and the visitors have scored at least 85 points in consecutive games.\n\nMeanwhile, Seattle ripped off back-to-back wins against the Dallas Wings before Friday's loss, scoring a combined 192 points in those victories. The Storm have posted at least 84 points in four straight games, and I see that trend continuing here, even with the Sky's impressive rim protection.\n\nIt certainly helps that Ezi Magbegor, Skylar Diggins-Smith, and Jordan Horston are all capable of providing double-digit points for Seattle -- as they did on Friday.\n\nThe Over has been a winner in five of the last seven meetings between these teams, and both ballclubs have the offensive playmakers to turn this into a back-and-forth thriller.\n\nSky vs Storm same-game parlay (SGP)\n\nChennedy Carter hasn't taken any backward steps since replacing Dana Evans in Chicago's starting line-up, and she torched this Seattle defense on Friday, with 33 points on 15-for-24 shooting despite not taking a single 3-point attempt.\n\nCarter has now scored 19 or more points in five of her last six outings, and I'm predicting another tough night for the Seattle backcourt against the Sky's in-form guard. In truth, this points prop O/U should be north of 20.\n\nI also like the Over on Loyd's assists total. With a stronger roster around her this season, Loyd no longer has to do it all in this Storm offense -- and that's unlocked more consistent playmaking.\n\nShe's posted four or more dimes in six of her last eight contests, and there could be a steady diet of drive-and-kick actions for Loyd this evening with Reese and Kamilla Cardoso in the paint to cut off easy layups.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nSky vs Storm trend\n\nThere's been plenty of home cooking in Seattle lately, with the Storm posting a 5-1 ATS mark in their last six games at Climate Pledge Arena.

She surpassed Temeka Johnson to move into 15th place on the WNBA's all-time assist list and became the 34th player in league history to score 4,500 points or more.\n\n\"We didn't even mention that in the locker room,\" Nneka Ogwumike said, per Dylan Ackermann of The Seattle Times. \"Those are two milestones we should have mentioned. It's no surprise. I'm just really, really happy to be on this team when she achieved those two milestones.\"\n\nDiggins-Smith's milestones came during a pivotal game for the Storm. Led by Ogwumike's 24 points and 13 rebounds, just two points shy of her season high, and Jewell Loyd's explosive second half, the Storm secured an 84-71 victory over the Sky.\n\nThe win marked a turnaround for the Storm, who had an eight-game home winning streak snapped by the Sky on July 5. Seattle knew that regaining their momentum required more than just winning the rebounding battle; it required grit. Angel Reese of the Sky also made history, becoming the first player in WNBA history with 13 consecutive double-doubles, tallying 17 points and 14 rebounds in the game.\n\n\"Congratulations to her,\" Storm coach Noelle Quinn said. \"What she's been doing her first year in the league is obviously legendary.\"\n\nAs the league leader in both offensive and total rebounds, Reese's presence demanded a collective effort from the Storm.\n\n\"We have to gang rebound,\" Quinn said. \"A player like that who just goes to the glass with heart, desire, athleticism, strength, it's hard to neutralize.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, Diggins-Smith inspired the team and the crowd. Early in the second quarter, her back-to-back threes ignited a rally that gave the Storm their first lead of the game. Her leadership on the court was evident as she orchestrated plays and kept the team focused.\n\nOgwumike praised her teammate, saying, \"She's the general. Coach's nickname for her is 'Deebo.' She's really like the muscle and brain of the team. That's a huge asset to have, especially as someone who plays point guard in this league.\"\n\nQuinn added, \"Her passion to play the game gives us a lot of energy on both sides of the court. Whether it's her getting a bucket or finding her teammates, she reads the game well. Her competitive nature, her dog, all those things give us a lot of confidence.\"\n\nRelated: Seattle Storm Social Media Sent A Strong Message To Angel Reese's Chicago Sky", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylar_Diggins-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Skylar Diggins-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nneka_Ogwumike", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nneka Ogwumike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Pledge_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate Pledge Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EuroLeague", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EuroLeague"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintrust_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wintrust Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temeka_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temeka Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nate Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Thomas_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Thomas (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewell_Loyd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jewell Loyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noelle_Quinn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noelle Quinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seattle_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Seattle Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/a2/1a2f6ae2-0da0-5ebc-9666-f8ab0b6c5a27/668c3495a043a.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 1340, "textEnd": 1346}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

The 22-year-old has had a record-breaking run in her first year as a pro, which has both fans and pundits singing her high praises.\n\nFor Reese, though, what is even more important is the reputation she has among her peers. In a recent interview, the former LSU star made a blunt admission about how she wants the players in the league -- especially the veterans -- to view what she brings to the table:\n\n\"A fierce competitor,\" she said. \"...

The Storm won four games in a row before suffering a 88-84 loss to the Sky on Friday. Key players to watch are Chennedy Carter and Jewell Loyd, with both favored to go over their respective player prop bets.\n\nThe 2023-24 WNBA season is in full swing, and one of the games on tap from today's slate features the Seattle Storm (13-7 SU, 13-7 ATS) hosting the Chicago Sky (8-11 SU, 8-11 ATS) for the second time in three days.\n\nHere is a look at which squad has the edge in this matchup and why.\n\nSeattle Storm vs. Chicago Sky Game Info\n\nWhen\n\nSun. July 7\n\nWhere\n\nClimate Pledge Arena\n\nTime\n\n6:00 PM EST\n\nLocation\n\nSeattle, WA\n\nTV\n\nFOX13, Prime Video, and MARQ\n\nStorm vs. Sky - Season Stats & Betting Trends Seattle is the favorite vs. Chicago again\n\nFollowing a two-game losing skid that dropped them to 9-6, the Seattle Storm put together a nice little run. Not only did they win each of the next four games, but all of those wins were by double-digit margins. Their margin of victory in those four games was 17 points per contest. That impressive win streak ended with an 88-84 loss to the Chicago Sky on Friday night.\n\nIn that contest, all five of the Storm's starting five reached double figures. Jordan Horston led the pack with 20 points and six rebounds on 8-of-11 shooting from the field and 2-of-4 from beyond the arc.\n\nNneka Ogwumike added 16 points, four assists, and three rebounds. Jewell Loyd -- who is the Storm's leading scorer -- contributed 13 points and five assists. However, she shot 5-of-14 from the floor and missed all six of her attempts from three-point range.\n\nDallas will look to salvage the two-game home stand when these teams clash again on Sunday afternoon.\n\nOn the other side of this matchup, the Sky dropped nine of their first 13 games, courtesy of a four-game losing streak. Since that start, Chicago has produced four wins across their last six outings. This includes back-to-back wins against the Atlanta Dream (85-77) and the Seattle Storm.\n\nFrom the Chicago side, only two of its starters registered double-digit scoring performances. Chennedy Carter scored a season-high 33 points along with four rebounds, three assists and three steals. She shot 15-of-24 from the field and converted three of her five attempts from the free throw line.\n\nNewly named All-Star Angel Reese had a solid outing as well. She finished with 27 points, 10 rebounds (including seven on the offensive glass), two assists and two blocks. Reese was also an efficient 8-of-13 from the floor, and she made her first 3-point shots of the season, finishing 2-of-2 from distance.\n\nFurthermore, Reese's 12th consecutive double-double tied Candace Parker's WNBA record that spanned across the 2009 and 2010 seasons. Can the Sky post their second win against the Storm in three days, or will Seattle get back on track before its upcoming mid-week showdown against the Las Vegas Aces?\n\nNow that we have set the stage for this East vs. West matchup, let's examine the betting trends for both sides.\n\nStorm vs. Sky Picks GIVEMESPORT presents our picks with analysis Spread\n\nDespite losing the front end of this two-game set against the Sky, Seattle enters this matchup as a nine-point favorite (via OddShark.com). Here is a look at how both ball clubs have fared against the spread this season.\n\nThe Storm are 4-1 ATS in their last five outings. Seattle has covered the spread seven times in its last eight \"home\" contests. The Sky are 3-7 ATS in their last 10 games Chicago is 4-2 ATS in its last six matchups against Seattle. In their last six \"road\" outings against the Storm, the Sky are 5-1 against the spread. Prediction: Chicago Sky (+9) Over/Under\n\nThe projected over/under total for this matchup is 164.5 points (per BleacherNation.com). Here is why going with the \"over\" is the smart choice.\n\nThe total has gone OVER five times in the Storm's last seven games against Chicago. In Seattle's last five \"home\" contests against Chicago, the OVER total is 4-1. The total has gone OVER four times in the Sky's last five games. In Chicago's last five \"road\" games, the OVER total cashed in four times. Prediction: OVER 164.5 points Player Prop Bets\n\n(Odds courtesy of DraftKings)\n\nOn the heels of her 33-point explosion against the Storm on Friday, fourth-year guard Chennedy Carter is the key player to watch for the Sky. She currently has -115 odds of scoring more than 18.5 points and -115 odds of finishing with less than 18.5 points.\n\nDo Carter's numbers favorably compare to the estimated points total for this matchup? Let's look at the tale of the tape to find out.\n\nDuring the season, Carter has been averaging 16.3 points per contest. In the previous two matchups against Seattle this season, Carter has averaged 22.5 points on 60.6 percent shooting from the field. Carter has suited up against Western Conference teams eight times this season. In those contests, she is averaging 16.4 points per outing. In nine road contests, the Chicago Sky guard is averaging 18.3 points per game. Over her last five outings, Carter has averaged 23.4 points, 3.0 rebounds, and 3.8 assists per contest, exceeding the points total for this matchup four times during that stretch.\n\nPrediction: Chennedy Carter OVER 18.5 points\n\nDespite her subpar 13-point outing the last time these teams played each other, expect Jewell Loyd to have a bounce-back performance, thus making her the key player to watch for the home team. She currently has -110 odds of scoring more than 20.5 points and -120 odds of finishing with less than 20.5 points.\n\nHere is a look at how her numbers stack up against the projected points total for this matchup.\n\nDuring the season, Loyd is averaging 19.9 points per contest. In the previous two matchups against Chicago this season, Loyd has averaged 16.0 points and 5.5 assists per contest on slash lines of .344/.100/.900. Loyd has played against Eastern Conference teams nine times this season. In those contests, she has averaged 21.2 points per outing. In 10 home contests, the Seattle Storm guard is averaging 21.5 points per game. Over her last five outings, Loyd has averaged 23.8 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 4.0 assists per contest, exceeding the points total for this matchup three times during that stretch.\n\nPrediction: Jewell Loyd OVER 20.5 points\n\nStorm vs. Sky Final Picks The Spread: Chicago Sky (+9) OddShark Over/Under: OVER 164.5 points (Bleacher Nation) Player Prop Bet #1: Chennedy Carter OVER 18.5 points Player Prop Bet #2: Jewell Loyd OVER 20.5 points Related Caitlin Clark Makes WNBA Triple-Double History in Fever Win vs. Liberty\n\nThe Indiana Fever rookie sensation continues to build on her legend.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennedy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chennedy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewell_Loyd", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jewell Loyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Pledge_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate Pledge Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nneka_Ogwumike", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nneka Ogwumike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Aces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Aces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(WNBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (WNBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wnba_sky-vs-storm.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 634, "textEnd": 640}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

She also rebounds a lot of her own misses.\n\nBut here's the important nuance that her critics are missing: even if you subtract all of the rebounds that she got from herself, she would still be leading the WNBA in offensive rebounding.\n\nReese is good at rebounding her own misses because she's good at rebounding everybody's misses. It doesn't matter who is shooting it or where the shot is coming from. If you had to pick one player most likely to grab a rebound, the best choice would be Reese by a mile.\n\nThe other odd criticism leveled against Reese is that it is a bad thing that she is rebounding her own misses. It's very normal for basketball players to chase their own misses, particularly with forwards and centers who play close to the rim.\n\nLooking at the NBA as a point of comparison, Reese rebounds her own misses less often than last year's offensive rebounding leader Clint Capela. Her percentage of rebounds coming from misses that are off unblocked shots (classified as z-bounds on the tracking site PBP Stats) is pretty much in line with other top rebounders in the NBA.\n\nNobody accuses Capela, Nikola Jokic or any of the other great offensive rebounders throughout any basketball league of stat padding. But Reese is judged by a different standard.\n\nReese is a historically talented offensive rebounder, full stop. That she's doing all of this as a rookie makes the feat even more impressive. She's well-deserving of her first All-Star selection. Don't let her haters tell you any differently.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaira_McCowan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teaira McCowan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yolanda_Griffith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yolanda Griffith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Capela", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clint Capela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-07/Angel%20Reese%20070924%20USA.jpeg?itok=NyBB4X9z", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 747, "textEnd": 755}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 1500, "textEnd": 1506}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Or a midseason trade?", "body": "The Chicago Sky reached the halfway point of the 2024 season Sunday with an 8-12 record after losing on the road to the Seattle Storm.\n\nDespite their losing record, the Sky have celebrated notable accomplishments this season, including the breakout rookie performance of All-Star Angel Reese and the ascension of guard Chennedy Carter to become the team's leading scorer.\n\nHere are seven questions facing the Sky in the second half of the season.\n\nDespite being forecast before the season as a bottom-four team, the Sky are on track to earn the final postseason berth. They're in eighth place in the WNBA, percentage points behind the seventh-place Indiana Fever (9-13) but the same number of games behind first.\n\nThe Sky are 4-6 in their last 10 games and 5-5 on the road, the league's fifth-best road record. They're one game ahead of the Atlanta Dream (7-13), whom they face Wednesday at Wintrust Arena (11 a.m., Marquee) as they try to add some separation.\n\nThis roster likely doesn't have the juice for a deep playoff run, but qualifying for the postseason and getting rookies Reese and Kamilla Cardoso their first round of playoff experience would be an overall win for a rebuilding team.\n\nThis is the key focus for the front office in the coming weeks. After placing Elizabeth Williams on the injured list with a season-ending torn meniscus, the Sky waived Gondrezick to clear room for a signing.\n\nThe Sky have a clear need to fill with the extra roster spot: outside shooting. While Reese and Cardoso are ensuring dominance on the boards -- the Sky lead the league with 36.4 rebounds per game -- the roster lacks production behind the arc. The Sky are last in made 3-pointers (4.4 per game), attempts (14.6 per game) and percentage (30.1%), and any improvement in either volume or efficiency would be a major lift for the offense.\n\nIdeally the Sky would have signed Brynna Maxwell to a rookie contract after drafting her with the No. 13 pick this spring. But Maxwell suffered a knee injury within days of arriving in Chicago and had not recovered to the point of joining a roster when the Sky waived Gondrezick last month.\n\nIt has been more than a week since the Sky waived Gondrezick -- so why is it taking so long to bring in a new player? The likely answer is the front office was waiting to reach eligibility for seven-day contracts, which can't be used until the second half of the season.\n\nNow that the Sky have played 20 games, they can cycle through players on lower-commitment seven-day contracts, which still count toward the salary cap. That would be a likely route to sign a waived player such as Dyaisha Fair or Crystal Dangerfield, either of whom would provide a shooting boost despite struggling to hold on to roster spots because of their size.\n\nThe trade market is another potential outlet for the Sky to bolster their roster. This year's trade deadline is Aug. 20 -- five days after play resumes following the Olympic break -- which means the front office has six weeks to potentially strike a deal.\n\nBut given the history of the league, a midseason trade is incredibly unlikely. There was only one in the entire league last season, a July deal in which the Washington Mystics sent Amanda Zahui B to the Indiana Fever in exchange for Queen Egbo. Only five midseason trades have been made over the last six seasons.\n\nThat doesn't mean a trade is impossible. The Sky were involved in arguably the most high-profile midseason trade in league history in 2015, when Sylvia Fowles declined her player option, sat out the first half of the season and eventually leveraged a trade to the Minnesota Lynx, with whom she won two championships.\n\nFor the Sky, the improbability of a trade also comes down to cost-benefit analysis. They can't move any of their highest-value players, which means a trade would come down to improving in the margins. If the Sky want to move on from Marina Mabrey's contract -- the heftiest on the roster at just over $206,000 per year -- that would be an easier deal to negotiate in the offseason. And only four players (Reese, Cardoso, Mabrey and Lindsay Allen) are signed past this season, so the Sky will see natural turnover in the offseason.\n\nRest. That's the most important to-do item -- especially for Cardoso and Reese, who haven't had a break since their college seasons began in October.\n\nThe Olympic break will give teams nearly a full month's reprieve from games, from July 21 to Aug. 14. Because the Sky don't have any Olympians, they will have the opportunity for full-team workouts during that time, a notable leg up for a group that has lacked cohesion even after 20 games together.\n\nOther clear priorities for the Sky during the break are drilling long-range shooting for the entire roster and smoothing out the wrinkles in the pick-and-roll game, especially with Cardoso.\n\nCoach Teresa Weatherspoon made a notable adjustment in recent weeks, pulling Mabrey out of closing units in clutch games in favor of wing Diamond DeShields. The Sky are 5-10 in games with a margin of five or fewer points in the final five minutes.\n\nMabrey is suffering a shooting slump this season, tumbling from the team scoring lead to third behind Carter and Reese in the course of a month. She shot 35.4% from the field and 26.8% behind the arc as her average production dropped to 12 points over the last 10 games.\n\nAnd those percentages are even lower in the clutch. Mabrey is shooting 18.2% from the field and 44.4% from the free-throw line in clutch minutes. She hasn't made a clutch basket or free throw in the last month while the Sky went 2-6 in tightly contested games with Mabrey in the closing unit.\n\nDeShields is shooting 25% from the field and 50% from the line in a smaller sample size, averaging only 1.5 clutch minutes over six games. But if Weatherspoon is trying to create marginal improvements to eke out more close games, it's clear she has identified Mabrey as holding the team back in these moments.\n\nHowever, benching Mabrey in the clutch could have negative effects for the Sky. The only way to break a player out of a slump is to allow her to play through it -- especially when it's the highest-paid player on the roster. And although DeShields has been marginally better than Mabrey in clutch moments, she doesn't provide enough of a lift to leave the team's supposed best shooter on the bench.\n\nIf the Sky want to get out of their clutch slump, they might have to let Mabrey work it out on the court -- even at the risk of more close losses.\n\nCarter picked up flagrant fouls in back-to-back games in Seattle last week, edging her closer to a one-game suspension. The league tallies both flagrant and technical fouls throughout the season, but the system for accrual-based punishment varies.\n\nTechnicals are assessed a combination of fines and suspensions on an increasing scale: $200 for the first three, $400 for the next three and $800 plus a one-game suspension for the seventh technical of the season. After that a player receives an $800 fine for each additional technical and a one-game suspension for every other technical (ninth, 11th, etc.). Natasha Cloud leads the league with five technicals this season.\n\nFines are not assessed for flagrant fouls, but an accumulation of such violations can similarly trigger a suspension. Players receive one point for every flagrant-1 foul and two points for every flagrant-2 violation. A player with four points will receive a one-game suspension for her next flagrant-1 foul. At six or more points, the suspension is increased to two games.\n\nCarter leads the league with three flagrant points, a risk factor that Weatherspoon said she will address with the guard. But it's a difficult issue to address; both of Carter's flagrant violations in Seattle resulted from basketball plays in which she was attempting to block a shot.\n\nIn addition to leading the team in scoring, Carter has been a defensive spark for the Sky with 1.3 steals per game. They can't afford to lose her to a suspension, but they also can't afford to dial back her defensive intensity. Weatherspoon might urge Carter to restrain herself around the rim -- at 5-foot-9, she's at a wingspan disadvantage to cleanly block taller opponents -- but a major adjustment isn't needed.\n\nThe window likely has shut for Evans to carve out a long-term spot on the Sky. After finishing third in Sixth Player of the Year voting in 2023, Evans lost the starting point guard position for the second consecutive season. Although her productivity has remained relatively stable -- 8.3 points, 3.2 assists, 1.0 steal and 1.5 turnovers per game -- Evans struggled to provide the offensive pop the Sky needed at the start of the year.\n\nNot everything is negative about Evans' performance this season. For instance, she's having one of the best 3-point shooting years of her career with a 36.2% clip on 2.9 attempts per game. But the Sky need to emphasize higher-volume shooting guards in the offseason, and Evans has not provided enough productivity as either a facilitator or a shotmaker to fit that mold.\n\nGiven Evans' inability to hold on to a starting job under two coaches in Chicago, it's unlikely the Gary native will remain with her local team when she becomes a free agent this winter.", "source": {"uri":

The rookie power forward for the Chicago Sky has been making a serious splash within the WNBA since the season began earlier this summer. She's been breaking records here and there and was most recently named an All-Star. Throughout this time, she's also gone viral on social media here and there, but I'm not sure anyone could've predicted what happened during her recent press conference. A hot mic and a risqu\u00e9 Big Bang Theory scene led to an amusingly awkward moment, and Reese later shared a three-word response.\n\nLet's set the scene, shall we? The viral moment happened while the former LSU player, her Chicago Sky teammate, Marina Mabrey, and coach Teresa Weatherspoon were waiting to take queries from journalists. While one person proceeded to ask a question, there was a comment from a hot mic. At the time, the three interviewees and others could hear someone asking about being in an \"intimate relationship.\" A few additional comments on that topic came through the feed before the audio was muted. You can check out the moment for yourself in the footage that WNBA Got Game shared on X:\n\nBig Bang Theory fans are sure to recognize the two voices that were playing at the time. The characters talking about relationships were none other than Kaley Cuoco's Penny and Jim Parsons' Sheldon Cooper. By the sounds of it, Penny was questioning Sheldon about whether he'd ever find a meaningful relationship. It's great that this was all cleared up but, as Angel Reese's funny three-word reaction, which she posted to X indicated, she was through for a loop:\n\nMost of us probably would've had the same reaction. Seriously, on the surface, it seemed as though someone was trying to ask the 22-year-old basketball phenom about her own relationship status. That's what arguably makes the already-weird interruption that much odder. When it comes to sports, there have certainly been some unexpected moments to occur at pressers, but this one certainly takes the cake.\n\nOne could argue that, if anything, this little faux pas is also a testament to the cultural footprint that The Big Bang Theory has at this point. The series (which topped a survey of beloved shows during its run) ended with Season 12 over five years ago, but many continue to catch the reruns and stream it. Of the eclectic cast of characters, Sheldon Cooper has become a particularly iconic figure, thanks to his eccentricities. Imagine how shook people would've been if they'd heard Sheldon's famous catchphrase, \"bazinga\" belted out during that press conference. At the very least, it may have made the audio more immediately easy to identify.\n\nAll in all, I really appreciate that Angel Reese seems to have a good sense of humor about all this. Honestly, I don't think there's much more you can do at this point than laugh about it. Bully for her for taking it in stride. Now, I'm just wondering if Reese might check out the hit CBS sitcom during her downtime.\n\nWhile I continue to ponder that, do yourself a favor and check out some of Angel Reese's games with the Chicago Sky as the WNBA season pushes on. Those who are looking for scripted content, though, can stream The Big Bang Theory with a Max subscription or check out the 2024 TV schedule for other options.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erik_swann@cinemablend.com", "name": "Erik Swann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_mic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hot mic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Big Bang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Mabrey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marina Mabrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Weatherspoon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Weatherspoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catchphrase", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catchphrase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Big Bang Theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rerun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rerun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w6a5LJDVUmtPSZcNEKxMCe-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

We have to gang rebound. Our guards have to come out and help out a lot more today.\"\n\nWhen a team pairs that with 6-foot-7 Kamilla Cardoso, the first quarter saw why the two rookies have been so effective together up to the midway point of the season.\n\nNot only did the Storm struggle to keep the duo off the glass, but the Storm also couldn't score inside, going 3 of 15 in the paint while allowing Cardoso to grab five offensive boards in the first quarter alone.\n\nAfter scoring just 12 points in the first quarter, Diggins-Smith rallied the crowd to get loud following back-to-back threes by Sami Whitcomb, which gave the Storm their first lead of the game early in the second quarter.\n\nWhen your team is struggling to create good looks, turning to your star player is always a solid option, but it wasn't until the final minutes of the first half, when Loyd finally scored her first two points of the game at the free-throw line, that the struggles of the first half were fully summed up.\n\nTo start the third quarter, Diggins-Smith found Ezi Magbegor on a pick-and-roll, leading to Magbegor finishing with a smooth up-and-under reverse layup.\n\nWhile it was just a routine pick-and-roll near the left block, this assist held special significance in the history books, as it not only extended her streak to 10 straight games with five or more assists but also elevated her position on the WNBA's all-time assist list.\n\nTwo plays later, Ogwumike found Diggins-Smith streaking up the sideline, and Diggins-Smith drove coast-to-coast to tie the game at 42, also marking her 4,500th career point.\n\nUnleashing her venom with a barrage of pullup jumpers, fadeaways and aggressive drives that earned her easy looks at the foul line, the Gold Mamba, Lloyd, followed up her subpar game Friday night and a challenging first half with 12 points in the third quarter.\n\nA day after it was announced that Magbegor would be playing alongside Storm legend Lauren Jackson for the Australian team in Paris for the second consecutive Olympic Games, she followed a franchise-record eight blocks in her last outing by securing her 10th rebound midway through the fourth quarter, finishing the game with 13 points, 13 rebounds and four blocks for her sixth double-double of the season.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Playing in front of a crowd of 11,283 at Climate Pledge Arena, which included notable figures such as UW legends Nate Robinson and Isaiah Thomas, as well as EuroLeague's all-time leading scorer Mike James, Diggins-Smith put on a talent show.\n\nDiggins-Smith moved past Temeka Johnson to claim the 15th spot on the WNBA's all-time assist list and became the 34th player in league history to score 4,500 points or more. Despite these accomplishments, her milestones were not immediately recognized.\n\n\"We didn't even mention that in the locker room,\" forward Nneka Ogwumike said, as reported by Dylan Ackermann of The Seattle Times. \"Those are two milestones we should have mentioned. It's no surprise. I'm just really, really happy to be on this team when she achieved those two milestones.\"\n\nOgwumike led the charge with 24 points and 13 rebounds, just two points shy of her season high. Jewell Loyd was also an important factor, contributing 20 points.\n\n\"There are times when you get to thinking too much. It's not like you forget how to play the game but you're overconsumed with schemes, stops, and making sure you're running and executing things,\" Ogwumike said. \"Jewell was basically like, 'We just need to hoop.' They're hooping, we just gotta hoop and respond and step it up a level. That's really helpful in those grind-out moments.\"\n\nSky rookie Angel Reese also made history during the game by becoming the first player in league history with 13 consecutive games recording a double-double, finishing with 17 points and 14 rebounds. Storm coach Noelle Quinn praised Reese's achievement, saying, \"Congratulations to her. What she's been doing her first year in the league is obviously legendary.\"\n\nSeattle Storm's strategy against the Chicago Sky\n\nThe Storm's strategy involved neutralizing Reese's dominance on the offensive glass, as she leads the league in both offensive rebounds and total rebounds.\n\n\"A player like that who just goes to the glass with heart, desire, athleticism, strength, it's hard to neutralize,\" Quinn said. \"We have to gang rebound. Our guards have to come out and help out a lot more today.\"\n\nThe game saw Diggins-Smith rally the crowd following back-to-back threes by Sami Whitcomb, giving the Storm their first lead of the game early in the second quarter. Diggins-Smith's assist to Ezi Magbegor on a pick-and-roll not only extended her streak to 10 straight games with five or more assists but also solidified her position on the WNBA's all-time assist list. Later, she drove coast-to-coast to tie the game at 42, marking her 4,500th career point.\n\n\"She's the general,\" Ogwumike said of Diggins-Smith. \"Coach's nickname for her is 'Deebo.' Yes, it is a reference to 'Friday' -- a 1995 film with Ice Cube. She's really like the muscle and brain of the team. That's a huge asset to have, especially as someone who plays point guard in this league. It's very rare that you have a (point guard) that can organize people and get hers as well.\"\n\nIn the third quarter, the Storm unleashed a 16-3 run that cemented their lead. Loyd scored 12 points in the third quarter alone.\n\n\"I just stay aggressive,\" Loyd said. \"I felt like I could get to the lane and get to my midrange.

It's no surprise. I'm just really, really happy to be on this team when she achieved those two milestones.\"\n\nLed by Ogwumike's 24 points and 13 rebounds, two points shy of her season high, along with Jewell Loyd's second-half eruption that saw her finish with 20 points, the Storm secured the season series against the Chicago Sky with an 84-71 victory at Climate Pledge Arena on Sunday afternoon.\n\n\"There are times when you get to thinking too much. It's not like you forget how to play the game but you're overconsumed with schemes, stops and making sure you're running and executing things,\" Ogwumike said. \"Jewell was basically like, 'We just need to hoop.' They're hooping, we just gotta hoop and respond and step it up a level. That's really helpful in those grind out moments.\n\n\"I think it definitely helps me realize, not just what I'm capable of, but what my teammates encourage me to be capable of.\"\n\nSky rookie Angel Reese also made history in impressive fashion by becoming the first player in league history with 13 consecutive games recording a double-double, tallying 17 points and 14 rebounds.\n\n\"Congratulations to her,\" Storm coach Noelle Quinn said. \"What she's been doing her first year in the league is obviously legendary.\"\n\nSeattle, which had won eight straight at home before Friday night's loss to the Sky, knew that getting back on track wasn't just about trying to win the rebounding battle, but about putting up a fight.\n\nMuch of Reese's success over her 13 consecutive double-double games stemmed from her dominance on the offensive glass.\n\nAs the league leader in both offensive rebounds and total rebounds, limiting her opportunities to track shots off the rim was crucial after struggling to do so in the first two meetings.\n\n\"It's extra possessions for them,\" Quinn said pregame. \"A player like that who just goes to the glass with heart, desire, athleticism, strength, it's hard to neutralize. We have to gang rebound. Our guards have to come out and help out a lot more today.\"\n\nWhen a team pairs that with 6-foot-7 Kamilla Cardoso, the first quarter saw why the two rookies have been so effective together up to the midway point of the season.\n\nNot only did the Storm struggle to keep the duo off the glass, but the Storm also couldn't score inside, going 3 of 15 in the paint while allowing Cardoso to grab five offensive boards in the first quarter alone.\n\nAfter scoring just 12 points in the first quarter, Diggins-Smith rallied the crowd to get loud following back-to-back threes by Sami Whitcomb, which gave the Storm their first lead of the game early in the second quarter.\n\nWhen your team is struggling to create good looks, turning to your star player is always a solid option. But it wasn't until the final minutes of the first half -- when Loyd finally scored her first two points of the game at the free-throw line -- that the struggles of the first half were fully summed up.\n\nTo start the third quarter, Diggins-Smith found Ezi Magbegor on a pick-and-roll, leading to Magbegor finishing with a smooth up-and-under reverse layup.\n\nWhile it was just a routine pick-and-roll near the left block, this assist held special significance in the history books as it not only extended her streak to 10 straight games with five or more assists but also elevated her position on the WNBA's all-time assist list.\n\nTwo plays later, Ogwumike found Diggins-Smith streaking up the sideline, and Diggins-Smith drove coast-to-coast to tie the game at 42, also marking her 4,500th career point.\n\n\"She's the general,\" Ogwumike said of Diggins-Smith. \"Coach's nickname for her is 'Debo.' Yes it is a reference to Friday -- a 1995 film with Ice Cube. She's really like the muscle and brain of the team. That's a huge asset to have, especially as someone who plays point guard in this league. It's very rare that you have a (point guard) that can organize people and get hers as well.\"\n\nQuinn added, \"Her passion to play the game gives us a lot of energy on both sides of the court. So whether it's her getting a bucket or finding her teammates, she reads the game well. Her competitive nature, her dog, all those things give us a lot of confidence.\"\n\nIn the midst of these milestones, a 16-3 run to start the quarter helped push the Storm ahead, and they never looked back.\n\nUnleashing her venom with a barrage of pullup jumpers, fadeaways and aggressive drives that earned her easy looks at the foul line, the Gold Mamba, Loyd, followed up her subpar game Friday night and a challenging first half with 12 points in the third quarter.\n\n\"I just stay aggressive,\" Loyd said. \"I felt like I could get to the lane and get to my midrange. I think sometimes, I know I'm a pretty good three-point shooter and a scorer in general, but the midrange is like my bread and butter. I feel like some teams think I'm nervous in that area, but I actually like it a lot. I took advantage of that.\"\n\nA day after it was announced that Magbegor -- as well as Whitcomb -- would be playing alongside Storm legend Lauren Jackson for the Australian team in Paris for the second consecutive Olympic Games, she followed a franchise-record eight blocks in her last outing by securing her 10th rebound midway through the fourth quarter, finishing the game with 13 points, 13 rebounds and four blocks for her sixth double-double of the season.\n\nThe defending champions, Las Vegas Aces, come to town on Wednesday to face the Storm (14-7) at noon at Climate Pledge Arena.",

As a result, Zoom press conferences are the norm and allow for greater participation, which is a good thing, but it also requires those who take part in the virtual pressers to be diligent with their mute button if they're going to be multi-tasking.\n\nOn Sunday night, after Angel Reese broke the WNBA record for consecutive double-doubles, the Sky's presser with Reese, Teresa Weatherspoon, and Marina Mabrey was interrupted by someone who didn't mute their mic watching The Big Bang Theory.\n\nIt's very funny watching the three different reactions to it from the podium, as Weatherspoon looks fed up, Reese finds it hysterical, and Mabrey is just glad she wasn't going insane when she was hearing things in the background.

Fans emphasized the importance of careful, respectful coverage when bringing news about their favorite players to the public.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Mabrey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marina Mabrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Weatherspoon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Weatherspoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Big Bang Theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/21ed51b7c1559d59b72da2da1f803adb/crop/0x0/1978x1318/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/07/08/17204728257052.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 90, "relevance": 1}

And Carter struck her in the head while Loyd was gathering to shoot.\n\nWhile it was a clear Flagrant foul, one of the Storm's commentators was calling for Carter to get ejected for the contact.\n\nBut most fans seem to agree that the right call was made to just give Carter a Flagrant 1 on the play.\n\nThis is the second consecutive game where Carter received a Flagrant foul. If she gets one more in this WNBA season, she'll be at risk of being suspended for one game.\n\nCarter will need to be on her best behavior from here on out.\n\nRelated: Chennedy Carter Sends Blunt Message to Caitlin Clark Fan After Sky, Fever Loss\n\nRelated: Angel Reese Wows WNBA Fans With Pregame Outfit Before Storm Clash", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grant_young@postandcourier.com", "name": "Grant Young", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewell_Loyd", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jewell Loyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennedy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chennedy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/4b/f4b0e1f7-3529-5445-b2d3-111144065f28/668b2eb48bc9e.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C84&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715253", "eventUri": "eng-9715253", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 88, "relevance": 1}

He&#x27;s 100, she&#x27;s 96", "text": "CARENTAN-LES-MARAIS, France \u2014 Together, the collective age of the bride and groom was nearly 200. But World War II veteran Harold Terens and his sweetheart Jeanne Swerlin proved that love is eternal as they tied the knot Saturday inland of the D-Day beaches in Normandy, France. Their respective ages - he\u2019s 100, she\u2019s a youngster of just 96 - made their nuptials an almost double-century celebration. Terens called it \"the best day of my life.\" On her way into the nuptials, the bubbly bride-to-be said: \u201cIt\u2019s not just for young people, love, you know? We get butterflies. And we get a little action, also.\" The location was the elegant stone-worked town hall of Carentan, a key initial D-Day objective that saw ferocious fighting after the June 6, 1944, Allied landings that helped rid Europe of Adolf Hitler\u2019s tyranny. Like other towns and villages across the Normandy coast where nearly 160,000 Allied troops came ashore under fire on five code-named beaches, it\u2019s an effervescent hub of remembrance and celebration on the 80th anniversary of the deeds and sacrifices of young men and women that day, festooned with flags and bunting and with veterans feted like rockstars. PHOTOS: A World War II veteran just married his bride near Normandy's D-Day beaches. He's 100, she's 96 As the swing of Glenn Miller and other period tunes rang out on the streets, well-wishers were already lined up a good hour before the wedding, behind barriers outside the town hall. After both declaring \u201coui\u201d to vows read by Carentan\u2019s mayor in English, the couple exchanged rings. \u201cWith this ring, I thee wed,\u201d Terens said. She giggled and gasped, \u201cReally?\u201d With Champagne flutes in hand, they waved through an open window to the adoring crowds outside. \u201cTo everybody\u2019s good health. And to peace in the world and the preservation of democracy all over the world and the end of the war in Ukraine and Gaza,\u201d Terens said as he and his new bride then clinked glasses and drank. The crowd yelled \u201cla mari\u00e9e!\u201d - the bride! - to Swerlin, who wore a long flowing dress of vibrant pink. Terens looked dapper in a light blue suit and matching pink kerchief in his breast pocket. And they\u2019re expected to get a very special wedding-night party: They\u2019ve been invited to the state dinner at the Elysee Palace on Saturday night with President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Joe Biden, the mayor said. The wedding was symbolic, not binding in law. Mayor Jean-Pierre Lhonneur\u2019s office said he wasn\u2019t empowered to wed foreigners who weren\u2019t residents of Carentan, and that the couple, who are both American, hadn\u2019t requested legally binding vows. However, they could always complete those formalities back in Florida if they wished. Lhonneur likes to say that Normandy is practically the 51st state of the USA, given its reverence and gratitude for veterans and the sacrifices of the tens of thousands of Allied soldiers who never made it home from the Battle of Normandy. Dressed in a 1940s dress that belonged to her mother, Louise, and a red beret, 73-year-old Jane Ollier was among the early-bird spectators who waited for a glimpse of the happy couple. \u201cIt\u2019s so touching to get married at that age,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cIf it can bring them happiness in the last years of their lives, that\u2019s fantastic.\u201d", "summary": "Together, the collective age of the bride and groom was nearly 200.

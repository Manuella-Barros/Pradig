{"id": 231440486, "title": "She was in Trump\u2019s Maga \u2018cult\u2019 \u2013 now she\u2019s fighting far-right extremism", "text": "While dozens of her neighbors piled into buses bound from Michigan for the US Capitol on 6 January, 2021, Penny Swan, a local Republican party activist and an outspoken Trump supporter, stayed home. But not for lack of enthusiasm: Swan wanted to join the throngs fighting to stop the certification of the 2020 election, but has a heart condition and worried about her ability to keep up. Instead, she watched social media in awe, as her friends and neighbors surged toward the Capitol. That was then. Since 2021, Swan, a medical equipment manager, has distanced herself from the rightwing group that organized the 6 January buses from her small, ruby-red town of Hillsdale, Michigan. Swan\u2019s formerly close friends in the movement have become political rivals. And come November, she won\u2019t vote for Trump. In an age of deepening political polarization, Swan\u2019s story, of going deep into the Maga movement and defecting, is a rare one. According to a 2022 Pew study, \u201cpartisan antipathy\u201d \u2013 deep dislike among members of a political party for the opposing group \u2013 has deepened in the US in the last decade. Democrats and Republicans are more likely today than 10 years ago to characterize each other as \u201cunintelligent\u201d and \u201cclose minded\u201d. And Republicans who identify strongly with their party tend to prefer Trump overwhelmingly, as evidenced in the Republican primaries, which the former president swept. As the operator of a popular local politics page online and a longtime political activist, Swan has not only evolved as a voter. She has also documented, and at times participated in the unravelling of her county\u2019s conservative movement \u2013 which, like the state Republican party, has gone to war with itself over far-right politics. A decade before 2,000 of Trump\u2019s most diehard supporters stormed the Capitol, Swan, a lifelong Republican and Hillsdale resident, began documenting local government meetings. Some meetings were livestreamed, but not all \u2013 including meetings of the county commissioners. \u201cI thought people needed to see the entire truth,\u201d said Swan. \u201cYou could read something in the newspaper and that had a narrative, you could hear something on the radio, and that had a narrative, but it didn\u2019t have the whole story. So I thought people should actually be able to see the entire process.\u201d For years, Swan recorded and uploaded every meeting of local government she could attend on to her Facebook page, a repository of citizen journalism and pissed-off commentary called Penny Swan Political Activist Facts Matter. With more than 1,400 followers \u2013 in a town of about 8,000 \u2013 Swan\u2019s page has become an important clearinghouse for political updates and a hub for heated debate, offering a window into the fraught world of Michigan conservative politics. In the wake of the 2020 election, the Republican party of Michigan \u2013 a swing state that flipped from Trump to Joe Biden in 2020 \u2013 saw a widening rift between the party\u2019s establishment and its fired-up Maga base. The split spilled into the county Republican party chapters, with local party organizations devolving into factions. In Hillsdale, a group of Republican activists aligned with the Trump wing of the party created an informal caucus within the party chapter. The Hillsdale group \u2013 since dubbed the America First Republicans \u2013 aimed to change the local party \u201cfrom neo-conservatism, your old establishment, George Bush-type crowd, to more of a modern day conservative group\u201d, said Jon Smith, who helped form the caucus in late 2019. The idea, Smith said, was to turn the local GOP from what he viewed as a sleepy and bureaucratic organization into a mobilized one. Swan was excited when Smith approached her about a new, more active formation in the local party. It sounded like the perfect opportunity to ramp up her political work. \u201cThose guys were like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to take over the party, and we\u2019re going to do more good stuff,\u2019\u201d said Swan. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018that sounds good. I\u2019m coming because I want to do something and be proactive.\u2019\u201d And they did: in 2020, Daren Wiseley, an ally of the rightwing faction, was elected chairman of the Republican party of Hillsdale county. Swan continued to work with the party, taking on the role of deputy treasurer and joining the organization\u2019s executive committee. The group was close-knit. They confided in each other about personal matters and hung out after meetings. Swan even spent holidays with Smith\u2019s family. It\u2019s not clear exactly when the relationship began to sour. By Smith\u2019s account, Swan just wasn\u2019t up for the job of deputy treasurer. \u201cWhen our treasurer quit, [Swan] was the deputy treasurer and we were behind on filing reports,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThat kind of pressure, Penny couldn\u2019t handle it.\u201d Swan has a different story. She says she raised concerns about the organization\u2019s handling of finances, which the executives were unable, or unwilling, to address. In a 7 April 2022 email to former chairman Wiseley, Swan resigned. \u201cIt is with deep regret that I feel the need to step down as deputy treasurer,\u201d wrote Swan. \u201cI have spoken with you, Vice-Chairman Lashaway and also Secretary Smith about my concerns often over the past six months, to no avail.\u201d Four months later, as the county party prepared for their annual convention, Swan\u2019s old friends purged dozens of members who they viewed as insufficiently loyal to the Maga right. During the convention, armed security guards blocked those delegates, who had been formally \u201cdisavowed\u201d, from entering. The standoff in the convention parking lot laid bare the divisions that had been festering in the organization for months and set the stage for a protracted legal battle over the rightful leaders of the Hillsdale county GOP. A court in 2022 found the America First faction could not rightfully claim to represent the county party, a victory for Swan\u2019s faction. To her former friends in the Hillsdale Republican party, Swan is a turncoat \u2013 her defection, a betrayal. To others in the community, Swan is a rare ally with an inside view of the far right. \u201cShe was kind of brainwashed,\u201d said Gail McClanahan, a Hillsdale county resident who led a successful recall campaign to unseat Stephanie Scott, an election-denying township clerk 2023. \u201cNot now. Penny, she\u2019s not scared,\u201d said McClanahan. \u201cShe\u2019s keeping us informed of the truth here in Hillsdale.\u201d Swan\u2019s split from the America First group, she says, was like leaving a \u201ccult\u201d. After she left and began criticizing the group online, her relationships with former friends in the group grew bitter. Swan says she even faced harassment and threats over her new political alignment. In a letter sent to a close contact of Swan\u2019s, someone who identified himself as \u201cLance\u201d alleged that Swan had \u201cspread hate, lies and misfortune\u201d, and warned that \u201cthis is my only and last chance to save her from herself [\u2026] I cannot be held responsible for doing what needs to be done in defending my friends who do not deserve what she is doing to them\u201d. Swan filed a police report and installed cameras in her apartment. In April 2022, Swan launched a campaign for an open seat on the city council, running on a pro-transparency platform. The race turned nasty. When a bitter fight broke out over the placement of children\u2019s books with LGBTQ+ themes in the local library, Swan defended the librarian and the books. A meme circulated online, shared by her former friends, calling Swan a pedophile. In an email to the Guardian, Jessica Spangler, a former Hillsdale librarian, said the protracted controversy sparked \u201ca considerable decline in my health, resulting in serious and lasting issues due to the undue stress endured during my tenure\u201d. Joshua Paladino, a rightwing graduate student at Hillsdale College who called for the removal of books from the library, won the open seat. Swan suffered a third heart attack in December 2022, prompting her to back off from political work. She no longer films at every city council meeting, and says she is trying to resist the pull of vitriolic online arguments. But her goal is the same: to resist the current of rightwing extremism that has come to define politics in her town and county. She has found some allies in the Republican party, like Scott Sessions, a member of the Hillsdale county GOP and the former mayor of Hillsdale. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s not really conservative,\u201d Sessions said about the America First group. \u201cIt\u2019s turned radical.\u201d With elections coming up on 6 August for numerous county seats, Swan is helping out on a few campaigns that she sees as critical to fending off the far-right push. Two stand out in particular: an election for county sheriff, pitting the incumbent Republican against Jon Rutan, a self-proclaimed \u201cconstitutional sheriff\u201d, and a race for county clerk, between Abe Dane, the current director of elections, and Stephanie Scott, who was recalled from a former post for embracing election conspiracy theories. The looming elections have Swan back on the politics beat. \u201cWhen I get up at five o\u2019clock in the morning, I\u2019m reading and writing until I go to work,\u201d said Swan. \u201cFor the most part, as soon as I get home at 2.30 or 3, I\u2019m working on it till I go to bed.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Penny Swan defected from the rightwing group that captured the local Republican party \u2013 and she won\u2019t be voting for Trump</p><p>While dozens of her neighbors piled into buses bound from Michigan for the US Capitol on 6 January, 2021, Penny Swan, a local Republican party activist and an outspoken Trump supporter, stayed home.

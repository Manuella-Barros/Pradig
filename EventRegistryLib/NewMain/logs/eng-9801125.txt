Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone of the United States went head-to-head with Femke Bol of the Netherlands in the 400-meter hurdles final.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone is the world record holder and reigning Olympic champion. She beat Bol at the Tokyo Olympics, then again at 2022 world championships. Bol, the reigning world champion, ran an inspired anchor leg for the Dutch to win gold in the 4x400-meter mixed relay on Saturday.\n\nGold for McLaughlin-Levrone, who breaks her own world record\n\nAmerican sprinter Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone broke her own world record in winning the women's 400-meter hurdle final.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone ran away from the rest of the field, posting a time of 50.37, easily breaking the Olympic mark of 51.46 she set in Tokyo three years ago and just ahead of the 50.65 she put up at the U.S. Olympic trials earlier this year.\n\nAnna Cockrell of the U.S. was second at 51.87, with Femke Bol of the Netherlands in third at 52.15.\n\nBoth were well behind McLaughlin-Levrone, who was around 10 meters in front of everyone else when she hit the tape.\n\nLyles had been diagnosed with COVID, AP source says\n\nAmerican sprinting star Noah Lyles is dealing with COVID-19.\n\nThe men's 100-meter champion was diagnosed with COVID two days before the 200-meter final, a source close to the situation told the AP.\n\nLyles seemed to be his typical amped-up self during introductions. He couldn't quite keep pace with gold medalist Letsile Tebogo or American teammate Kenny Bednarek, who grabbed silver.\n\nLyles held on for bronze then fell to the track afterward.\n\nNo double for Noah Lyles, settles for bronze in 200\n\nThere will be no golden double for American sprinter Noah Lyles.\n\nThe 100-meter champion could only salvage bronze in the men's 200-meter final.\n\nLetsile Tebogo of Botswana earned the gold with a time of 19.46. Tebogo was in control the whole way, beating silver medalist Kenneth Bednarek by a stride.\n\nLyles, who raced out onto the track trying to amp up the crowd, held on for third. He fell to the track in the immediate aftermath and was tended to by trainers before getting up and walking over to a nearby bench.\n\nLyles had edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by five-thousandths of a second in the 100. He was a heavy favorite in the 200 -- his better race -- though he trailed Tebogo in Wednesday's qualifying heat.\n\nMihambo's challenge: Winning consecutive golds in long jump\n\nDefending Olympic long jump champion Malaika Mihambo of Germany has history working against her as she looks to defend her title in the women's final.\n\nNo woman has won consecutive golds in the event since it was introduced at the 1948 London Games.\n\nGerman great Heike Drechsler is the only two-time Olympic champion. She reached the top of the podium in 1992 in Barcelona and again in Sydney eight years later. Drechsler began her Olympic career with a silver in 1988 while competing for East Germany.\n\nThe long jump final is part of a busy night at Stade de France that will include the men's 200-meter and women's 400-meter hurdles final.\n\nSha'Carri Richardson to the rescue\n\nSha'Carri Richardson bailed out the U.S. women out from a near collapse earlier Thursday in the Olympic 4x100 relay, overcoming a German runner in the anchor leg to help the Americans win their heat and move to the gold-medal race.\n\nThe U.S. men, who haven't won a medal in this event since 2004, advanced easily despite a small hiccup. In the strangest twist of all, it was Jamaica's men who struggled with the baton and will be sitting on the sideline for Friday's final.\n\nIn the women's race, Richardson was about three steps behind after receiving the baton from Gabby Thomas, who earlier nearly misconnected on her exchange with Twanisha Terry.\n\nThat put Richardson in a hole against Rebekka Haase, but the 100-meter silver medal winner was looking back at Haase by the finish.

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone of the United States went head-to-head with Femke Bol of the Netherlands in the 400-meter hurdles final.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone is the world record holder and reigning Olympic champion. She beat Bol at the Tokyo Olympics, then again at 2022 world championships. Bol, the reigning world champion, ran an inspired anchor leg for the Dutch to win gold in the 4x400-meter mixed relay on Saturday.\n\nGrant Holloway finally gets his Olympic gold\n\nGrant Holloway's long wait to reach the top of the Olympic podium is over.\n\nThe American hurdler cruised to victory in the men's 110-meter final. The three-time world champion and silver medalist in Tokyo three years ago exploded out of the blocks to win going away.\n\nHolloway finished at 12.99 seconds, well clear of teammate Daniel Roberts in second at 13.09. Roberts out-leaned Rasheed Broadbell of Jamaica, who finished with bronze.\n\nGold for McLaughlin-Levrone, who breaks her own world record\n\nAmerican sprinter Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone broke her own world record in winning the women's 400-meter hurdle final.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone ran away from the rest of the field, posting a time of 50.37, easily breaking the Olympic mark of 51.46 she set in Tokyo three years ago and just ahead of the 50.65 she put up at the U.S. Olympic trials earlier this year.\n\nAnna Cockrell of the U.S. was second at 51.87, with Femke Bol of the Netherlands in third at 52.15.\n\nBoth were well behind McLaughlin-Levrone, who was around 10 meters in front of everyone else when she hit the tape.\n\nLyles had been diagnosed with COVID, AP source says\n\nAmerican sprinting star Noah Lyles is dealing with COVID-19.\n\nThe men's 100-meter champion was diagnosed with COVID two days before the 200-meter final, a source close to the situation told the AP.\n\nLyles seemed to be his typical amped-up self during introductions. He couldn't quite keep pace with gold medalist Letsile Tebogo or American teammate Kenny Bednarek, who grabbed silver.\n\nLyles held on for bronze then fell to the track afterward.\n\nNo double for Noah Lyles, settles for bronze in 200\n\nThere will be no golden double for American sprinter Noah Lyles.\n\nThe 100-meter champion could only salvage bronze in the men's 200-meter final.\n\nLetsile Tebogo of Botswana earned the gold with a time of 19.46. Tebogo was in control the whole way, beating silver medalist Kenneth Bednarek by a stride.\n\nLyles, who raced out onto the track trying to amp up the crowd, held on for third. He fell to the track in the immediate aftermath and was tended to by trainers before getting up and walking over to a nearby bench.\n\nLyles had edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by five-thousandths of a second in the 100. He was a heavy favorite in the 200 -- his better race -- though he trailed Tebogo in Wednesday's qualifying heat.\n\nMihambo's challenge: Winning consecutive golds in long jump\n\nDefending Olympic long jump champion Malaika Mihambo of Germany has history working against her as she looks to defend her title in the women's final.\n\nNo woman has won consecutive golds in the event since it was introduced at the 1948 London Games.\n\nGerman great Heike Drechsler is the only two-time Olympic champion. She reached the top of the podium in 1992 in Barcelona and again in Sydney eight years later. Drechsler began her Olympic career with a silver in 1988 while competing for East Germany.\n\nThe long jump final is part of a busy night at Stade de France that will include the men's 200-meter and women's 400-meter hurdles final.\n\nSha'Carri Richardson to the rescue\n\nSha'Carri Richardson bailed out the U.S. women out from a near collapse earlier Thursday in the Olympic 4x100 relay, overcoming a German runner in the anchor leg to help the Americans win their heat and move to the gold-medal race.\n\nThe U.S. men, who haven't won a medal in this event since 2004, advanced easily despite a small hiccup. In the strangest twist of all, it was Jamaica's men who struggled with the baton and will be sitting on the sideline for Friday's final.\n\nIn the women's race, Richardson was about three steps behind after receiving the baton from Gabby Thomas, who earlier nearly misconnected on her exchange with Twanisha Terry.\n\nThat put Richardson in a hole against Rebekka Haase, but the 100-meter silver medal winner was looking back at Haase by the finish.

She beat Bol at the Tokyo Olympics, then again at 2022 world championships. Bol, the reigning world champion, ran an inspired anchor leg for the Dutch to win gold in the 4x400-meter mixed relay on Saturday.\n\nLyles had been diagnosed with COVID, AP source says\n\nAmerican sprinting star Noah Lyles is dealing with COVID-19.\n\nThe men's 100-meter champion was diagnosed with COVID two days before the 200-meter final, a source close to the situation told the AP.\n\nLyles seemed to be his typical amped-up self during introductions. He couldn't quite keep pace with gold medalist Letsile Tebogo or American teammate Kenny Bednarek, who grabbed silver.\n\nLyles held on for bronze then fell to the track afterward.\n\nNo double for Noah Lyles, settles for bronze in 200\n\nThere will be no golden double for American sprinter Noah Lyles.\n\nThe 100-meter champion could only salvage bronze in the men's 200-meter final.\n\nLetsile Tebogo of Botswana earned the gold with a time of 19.46. Tebogo was in control the whole way, beating silver medalist Kenneth Bednarek by a stride.\n\nLyles, who raced out onto the track trying to amp up the crowd, held on for third. He fell to the track in the immediate aftermath and was tended to by trainers before getting up and walking over to a nearby bench.\n\nLyles had edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by five-thousandths of a second in the 100. He was a heavy favorite in the 200 -- his better race -- though he trailed Tebogo in Wednesday's qualifying heat.\n\nMihambo's challenge: Winning consecutive golds in long jump\n\nDefending Olympic long jump champion Malaika Mihambo of Germany has history working against her as she looks to defend her title in the women's final.\n\nNo woman has won consecutive golds in the event since it was introduced at the 1948 London Games.\n\nGerman great Heike Drechsler is the only two-time Olympic champion. She reached the top of the podium in 1992 in Barcelona and again in Sydney eight years later. Drechsler began her Olympic career with a silver in 1988 while competing for East Germany.\n\nThe long jump final is part of a busy night at Stade de France that will include the men's 200-meter and women's 400-meter hurdles final.\n\nSha'Carri Richardson to the rescue\n\nSha'Carri Richardson bailed out the U.S. women out from a near collapse earlier Thursday in the Olympic 4x100 relay, overcoming a German runner in the anchor leg to help the Americans win their heat and move to the gold-medal race.\n\nThe U.S. men, who haven't won a medal in this event since 2004, advanced easily despite a small hiccup. In the strangest twist of all, it was Jamaica's men who struggled with the baton and will be sitting on the sideline for Friday's final.\n\nIn the women's race, Richardson was about three steps behind after receiving the baton from Gabby Thomas, who earlier nearly misconnected on her exchange with Twanisha Terry.\n\nThat put Richardson in a hole against Rebekka Haase, but the 100-meter silver medal winner was looking back at Haase by the finish. The U.S. won in 41.94 seconds, .19 ahead of the Germans.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

A bad first exchange put them behind, and when 100 silver medalist Kishane Thompson took off too fast, then had to slow down to receive the stick for the anchor lap, Jamaica was cooked.\n\nThompson crossed the line fourth leaving Jamaica's women with the only chance in the 4x100 to add to the country's lone sprint medal so far in Paris.\n\nNone of that team's best sprinters over the past decade -- Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Shericka Jackson or Elaine Thompson-Herah -- were on the team that finished third in its heat.\n\nNo team came into the qualifying race with a more loaded lineup that the U.S. women, but it all nearly cratered when Thomas took off early on the third leg, then had to slow down to receive the baton from Terry.\n\nBoth sprinters appeared to have their hand on the baton as Thomas crossed over the yellow line marking the end of the passing zone, which would make it a legal pass.", "source": {"uri": "13wmaz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WMAZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha'Carri_Richardson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sha'Carri Richardson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Relay race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_leg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anchor leg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyree_King", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyree King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Thomas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gabrielle Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twanisha_Terry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twanisha Terry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebekka_Haase", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebekka Haase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Coleman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian Coleman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_Thompson-Herah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elaine Thompson-Herah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shericka_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shericka Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelly-Ann_Fraser-Pryce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Cross_Country", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Cross Country", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://media.13wmaz.com/assets/CCT/images/d25251ea-f489-4439-acba-1ef3f23546b1/20240808T121628/d25251ea-f489-4439-acba-1ef3f23546b1_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801125", "eventUri": "eng-9801125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone of the United States went head-to-head with Femke Bol of the Netherlands in the 400-meter hurdles final.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone is the world record holder and reigning Olympic champion. She beat Bol at the Tokyo Olympics, then again at 2022 world championships. Bol, the reigning world champion, ran an inspired anchor leg for the Dutch to win gold in the 4x400-meter mixed relay on Saturday.\n\nLyles had chills, aches, sore throat from COVID\n\nAmerican sprinter Noah Lyles says COVID-19 left him at less than his best for the 200-meter final that ended with bronze instead of gold.\n\nLyles says he was diagnosed with COVID on Tuesday morning. He dealt with chills, aches and a sore throat. He says he was feeling better by the time he ran onto the track at Stade de France. Lyles estimates he was about 90-95 percent by the time the starting gun went off.\n\nLyles says he never thought of not competing, adding he hasn't made up his mind on whether to race for the U.S. in the men's 4x100 final scheduled for Friday.\n\nGrant Holloway finally gets his Olympic gold\n\nGrant Holloway's long wait to reach the top of the Olympic podium is over.\n\nThe American hurdler cruised to victory in the men's 110-meter final. The three-time world champion and silver medalist in Tokyo three years ago exploded out of the blocks to win going away.\n\nHolloway finished at 12.99 seconds, well clear of teammate Daniel Roberts in second at 13.09. Roberts out-leaned Rasheed Broadbell of Jamaica, who finished with bronze.\n\nGold for McLaughlin-Levrone, who breaks her own world record\n\nAmerican sprinter Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone broke her own world record in winning the women's 400-meter hurdle final.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone ran away from the rest of the field, posting a time of 50.37, easily breaking the Olympic mark of 51.46 she set in Tokyo three years ago and just ahead of the 50.65 she put up at the U.S. Olympic trials earlier this year.\n\nAnna Cockrell of the U.S. was second at 51.87, with Femke Bol of the Netherlands in third at 52.15.\n\nBoth were well behind McLaughlin-Levrone, who was around 10 meters in front of everyone else when she hit the tape.\n\nLyles had been diagnosed with COVID, AP source says\n\nAmerican sprinting star Noah Lyles is dealing with COVID-19.\n\nThe men's 100-meter champion was diagnosed with COVID two days before the 200-meter final, a source close to the situation told the AP.\n\nLyles seemed to be his typical amped-up self during introductions. He couldn't quite keep pace with gold medalist Letsile Tebogo or American teammate Kenny Bednarek, who grabbed silver.\n\nLyles held on for bronze then fell to the track afterward.\n\nNo double for Noah Lyles, settles for bronze in 200\n\nThere will be no golden double for American sprinter Noah Lyles.\n\nThe 100-meter champion could only salvage bronze in the men's 200-meter final.\n\nLetsile Tebogo of Botswana earned the gold with a time of 19.46. Tebogo was in control the whole way, beating silver medalist Kenneth Bednarek by a stride.\n\nLyles, who raced out onto the track trying to amp up the crowd, held on for third. He fell to the track in the immediate aftermath and was tended to by trainers before getting up and walking over to a nearby bench.\n\nLyles had edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by five-thousandths of a second in the 100. He was a heavy favorite in the 200 -- his better race -- though he trailed Tebogo in Wednesday's qualifying heat.\n\nMihambo's challenge: Winning consecutive golds in long jump\n\nDefending Olympic long jump champion Malaika Mihambo of Germany has history working against her as she looks to defend her title in the women's final.\n\nNo woman has won consecutive golds in the event since it was introduced at the 1948 London Games.\n\nGerman great Heike Drechsler is the only two-time Olympic champion. She reached the top of the podium in 1992 in Barcelona and again in Sydney eight years later. Drechsler began her Olympic career with a silver in 1988 while competing for East Germany.\n\nThe long jump final is part of a busy night at Stade de France that will include the men's 200-meter and women's 400-meter hurdles final.\n\nSha'Carri Richardson to the rescue\n\nSha'Carri Richardson bailed out the U.S. women out from a near collapse earlier Thursday in the Olympic 4x100 relay, overcoming a German runner in the anchor leg to help the Americans win their heat and move to the gold-medal race.\n\nThe U.S. men, who haven't won a medal in this event since 2004, advanced easily despite a small hiccup. In the strangest twist of all, it was Jamaica's men who struggled with the baton and will be sitting on the sideline for Friday's final.\n\nIn the women's race, Richardson was about three steps behind after receiving the baton from Gabby Thomas, who earlier nearly misconnected on her exchange with Twanisha Terry.\n\nThat put Richardson in a hole against Rebekka Haase, but the 100-meter silver medal winner was looking back at Haase by the finish.

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone of the United States went head-to-head with Femke Bol of the Netherlands in the 400-meter hurdles final.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone is the world record holder and reigning Olympic champion. She beat Bol at the Tokyo Olympics, then again at 2022 world championships. Bol, the reigning world champion, ran an inspired anchor leg for the Dutch to win gold in the 4x400-meter mixed relay on Saturday.\n\nLyles had chills, aches, sore throat from COVID\n\nAmerican sprinter Noah Lyles says COVID-19 left him at less than his best for the 200-meter final that ended with bronze instead of gold.\n\nLyles says he was diagnosed with COVID on Tuesday morning. He dealt with chills, aches and a sore throat. He says he was feeling better by the time he ran onto the track at Stade de France. Lyles estimates he was about 90-95 percent by the time the starting gun went off.\n\nLyles says he never thought of not competing, adding he hasn't made up his mind on whether to race for the U.S. in the men's 4x100 final scheduled for Friday.\n\nGrant Holloway finally gets his Olympic gold\n\nGrant Holloway's long wait to reach the top of the Olympic podium is over.\n\nThe American hurdler cruised to victory in the men's 110-meter final. The three-time world champion and silver medalist in Tokyo three years ago exploded out of the blocks to win going away.\n\nHolloway finished at 12.99 seconds, well clear of teammate Daniel Roberts in second at 13.09. Roberts out-leaned Rasheed Broadbell of Jamaica, who finished with bronze.\n\nGold for McLaughlin-Levrone, who breaks her own world record\n\nAmerican sprinter Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone broke her own world record in winning the women's 400-meter hurdle final.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone ran away from the rest of the field, posting a time of 50.37, easily breaking the Olympic mark of 51.46 she set in Tokyo three years ago and just ahead of the 50.65 she put up at the U.S. Olympic trials earlier this year.\n\nAnna Cockrell of the U.S. was second at 51.87, with Femke Bol of the Netherlands in third at 52.15.\n\nBoth were well behind McLaughlin-Levrone, who was around 10 meters in front of everyone else when she hit the tape.\n\nLyles had been diagnosed with COVID, AP source says\n\nAmerican sprinting star Noah Lyles is dealing with COVID-19.\n\nThe men's 100-meter champion was diagnosed with COVID two days before the 200-meter final, a source close to the situation told the AP.\n\nLyles seemed to be his typical amped-up self during introductions. He couldn't quite keep pace with gold medalist Letsile Tebogo or American teammate Kenny Bednarek, who grabbed silver.\n\nSign Up For Free: Denver AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from overnight and the stories to follow throughout the day.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Featured Local Savings\n\nLyles held on for bronze then fell to the track afterward.\n\nNo double for Noah Lyles, settles for bronze in 200\n\nThere will be no golden double for American sprinter Noah Lyles.\n\nThe 100-meter champion could only salvage bronze in the men's 200-meter final.\n\nLetsile Tebogo of Botswana earned the gold with a time of 19.46. Tebogo was in control the whole way, beating silver medalist Kenneth Bednarek by a stride.\n\nLyles, who raced out onto the track trying to amp up the crowd, held on for third. He fell to the track in the immediate aftermath and was tended to by trainers before getting up and walking over to a nearby bench.\n\nLyles had edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by five-thousandths of a second in the 100. He was a heavy favorite in the 200 -- his better race -- though he trailed Tebogo in Wednesday's qualifying heat.\n\nMihambo's challenge: Winning consecutive golds in long jump\n\nDefending Olympic long jump champion Malaika Mihambo of Germany has history working against her as she looks to defend her title in the women's final.\n\nNo woman has won consecutive golds in the event since it was introduced at the 1948 London Games.\n\nGerman great Heike Drechsler is the only two-time Olympic champion. She reached the top of the podium in 1992 in Barcelona and again in Sydney eight years later. Drechsler began her Olympic career with a silver in 1988 while competing for East Germany.\n\nThe long jump final is part of a busy night at Stade de France that will include the men's 200-meter and women's 400-meter hurdles final.\n\nSha'Carri Richardson to the rescue\n\nSha'Carri Richardson bailed out the U.S. women out from a near collapse earlier Thursday in the Olympic 4x100 relay, overcoming a German runner in the anchor leg to help the Americans win their heat and move to the gold-medal race.\n\nThe U.S. men, who haven't won a medal in this event since 2004, advanced easily despite a small hiccup. In the strangest twist of all, it was Jamaica's men who struggled with the baton and will be sitting on the sideline for Friday's final.\n\nIn the women's race, Richardson was about three steps behind after receiving the baton from Gabby Thomas, who earlier nearly misconnected on her exchange with Twanisha Terry.\n\nThat put Richardson in a hole against Rebekka Haase, but the 100-meter silver medal winner was looking back at Haase by the finish. The U.S. won in 41.94 seconds, .19 ahead of the Germans.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE DENVER GAZETTE", "source": {"uri":

Richardson previously earned the silver medal in the 100-meter dash.\n\nRichardson overcame runners from Britain and Germany, to help the U.S. finish in 41.78 seconds, good for a .07-second win over Britain, which struggled with two baton changes in the rain.\n\nGabby Thomas ran the third leg and got her second gold of the Games, this one going with the 200-meter title. Twanisha Terry and 100 bronze medalist Melissa Jefferson rounded out the team. The exchange between Terry and Thomas that nearly wrecked the Americans in qualifying was better this time.\n\nStill, when Thomas handed off to Richardson, the U.S. was in third.\n\nRichardson had to reel in Daryll Neita (Britain) and Rebekka Haase (Germany), and when she did, she flashed a look to her right -- and backward -- that said ''you're not catching me.\"\n\nShe sprinted eight more steps down the track, and on her ninth, lifted her left leg high and stomped it on the other side of the finish line, then let out a scream.\n\nIt marked a sweet close to the Olympics for Richardson, who came into the Olympics as a favorite but surprisingly fell to Julien Alfred of St. Lucia.\n\nThe sprinting star also played a key role in the American team just making it into the final.\n\nShe saved the American women with her anchor leg in the opening heat after a bad exchange between Thomas and Terry. The U.S. women won that heat, which made them a favorite in the final.\n\nNo team came into the qualifying race with a more loaded lineup that the U.S. women, but it all nearly cratered when Thomas took off early on the third leg, then had to slow down to receive the baton from Terry.\n\nBoth sprinters appeared to have their hand on the baton as Thomas crossed over the yellow line marking the end of the passing zone, which would make it a legal pass.\n\nRichardson did not earn a spot in the 200-meter race after finishing fourth at the U.S. track trials earlier this summer. That made the 100-meter dash Richardson's only spot at an individual Olympic medal in Paris.\n\nThe 24-year-old was beat by Julien Alfred, who gave Saint Lucia its first ever Olympic medal with her victory. Alfred got off to a fantastic start, then powered through the rain and beat Richardson by .15 seconds -- about three body lengths.\n\nIt was the biggest margin in the women's Olympic 100 since 2008.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. men extended their drought to 20 years without a medal in the Olympic 4x100 relay, disqualified for an illegal pass after Christian Coleman crashed into teammate Kenny Bednarek while making the exchange between the first and second legs.\n\nAndre De Grasse put a bright mark on an otherwise disappointing Olympics by anchoring Canada to gold in a time of 37.50 seconds. It was the first medal in Paris for De Grasse, but his seventh overall. South Africa finished second and Britain third.\n\nIn the men's race, even without Noah Lyles, who was out of the lineup due to COVID, this looked like America's race to lose.

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone of the United States went head-to-head with Femke Bol of the Netherlands in the 400-meter hurdles final.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone is the world record holder and reigning Olympic champion. She beat Bol at the Tokyo Olympics, then again at 2022 world championships. Bol, the reigning world champion, ran an inspired anchor leg for the Dutch to win gold in the 4x400-meter mixed relay on Saturday.\n\nGrant Holloway's long wait to reach the top of the Olympic podium is over.\n\nThe American hurdler cruised to victory in the men's 110-meter final. The three-time world champion and silver medalist in Tokyo three years ago exploded out of the blocks to win going away.\n\nHolloway finished at 12.99 seconds, well clear of teammate Daniel Roberts in second at 13.09. Roberts out-leaned Rasheed Broadbell of Jamaica, who finished with bronze.\n\nAmerican sprinter Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone broke her own world record in winning the women's 400-meter hurdle final.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone ran away from the rest of the field, posting a time of 50.37, easily breaking the Olympic mark of 51.46 she set in Tokyo three years ago and just ahead of the 50.65 she put up at the U.S. Olympic trials earlier this year.\n\nAnna Cockrell of the U.S. was second at 51.87, with Femke Bol of the Netherlands in third at 52.15.\n\nBoth were well behind McLaughlin-Levrone, who was around 10 meters in front of everyone else when she hit the tape.\n\nAmerican sprinting star Noah Lyles is dealing with COVID-19.\n\nThe men's 100-meter champion was diagnosed with COVID two days before the 200-meter final, a source close to the situation told the AP.\n\nLyles seemed to be his typical amped-up self during introductions. He couldn't quite keep pace with gold medalist Letsile Tebogo or American teammate Kenny Bednarek, who grabbed silver.\n\nLyles held on for bronze then fell to the track afterward.\n\nLetsile Tebogo of Botswana earned the gold with a time of 19.46. Tebogo was in control the whole way, beating silver medalist Kenneth Bednarek by a stride.\n\nLyles, who raced out onto the track trying to amp up the crowd, held on for third. He fell to the track in the immediate aftermath and was tended to by trainers before getting up and walking over to a nearby bench.\n\nLyles had edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by five-thousandths of a second in the 100. He was a heavy favorite in the 200 -- his better race -- though he trailed Tebogo in Wednesday's qualifying heat.\n\nDefending Olympic long jump champion Malaika Mihambo of Germany has history working against her as she looks to defend her title in the women's final.\n\nNo woman has won consecutive golds in the event since it was introduced at the 1948 London Games.\n\nGerman great Heike Drechsler is the only two-time Olympic champion. She reached the top of the podium in 1992 in Barcelona and again in Sydney eight years later. Drechsler began her Olympic career with a silver in 1988 while competing for East Germany.\n\nThe long jump final is part of a busy night at Stade de France that will include the men's 200-meter and women's 400-meter hurdles final.\n\nSha'Carri Richardson bailed out the U.S. women out from a near collapse earlier Thursday in the Olympic 4x100 relay, overcoming a German runner in the anchor leg to help the Americans win their heat and move to the gold-medal race.\n\nThe U.S. men, who haven't won a medal in this event since 2004, advanced easily despite a small hiccup. In the strangest twist of all, it was Jamaica's men who struggled with the baton and will be sitting on the sideline for Friday's final.\n\nIn the women's race, Richardson was about three steps behind after receiving the baton from Gabby Thomas, who earlier nearly misconnected on her exchange with Twanisha Terry.\n\nThat put Richardson in a hole against Rebekka Haase, but the 100-meter silver medal winner was looking back at Haase by the finish. The U.S. won in 41.94 seconds, .19 ahead of the Germans.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Richardson previously earned the silver medal in the 100-meter dash.\n\nRichardson overcame runners from Britain and Germany, to help the U.S. finish in 41.78 seconds, good for a .07-second win over Britain, which struggled with two baton changes in the rain.\n\nGabby Thomas ran the third leg and got her second gold of the Games, this one going with the 200-meter title. Twanisha Terry and 100 bronze medalist Melissa Jefferson rounded out the team. The exchange between Terry and Thomas that nearly wrecked the Americans in qualifying was better this time.\n\nStill, when Thomas handed off to Richardson, the U.S. was in third.\n\nRichardson had to reel in Daryll Neita (Britain) and Rebekka Haase (Germany), and when she did, she flashed a look to her right -- and backward -- that said ''you're not catching me.\"\n\nShe sprinted eight more steps down the track, and on her ninth, lifted her left leg high and stomped it on the other side of the finish line, then let out a scream.\n\nIt marked a sweet close to the Olympics for Richardson, who came into the Olympics as a favorite but surprisingly fell to Julien Alfred of St. Lucia.\n\nThe sprinting star also played a key role in the American team just making it into the final.\n\nShe saved the American women with her anchor leg in the opening heat after a bad exchange between Thomas and Terry. The U.S. women won that heat, which made them a favorite in the final.\n\nNo team came into the qualifying race with a more loaded lineup that the U.S. women, but it all nearly cratered when Thomas took off early on the third leg, then had to slow down to receive the baton from Terry.\n\nBoth sprinters appeared to have their hand on the baton as Thomas crossed over the yellow line marking the end of the passing zone, which would make it a legal pass.\n\nRichardson did not earn a spot in the 200-meter race after finishing fourth at the U.S. track trials earlier this summer.

In the strangest twist of all, it was Jamaica's men who struggled with the baton and will be sitting on the sideline for Friday's final.\n\nIn the women's race, Richardson was about three steps behind after receiving the baton from Gabby Thomas, who earlier nearly misconnected on her exchange with Twanisha Terry.\n\nThat put Richardson in a hole against Rebekka Haase, but the 100-meter silver medal winner was looking back at Haase by the finish. The U.S. won in 41.94 seconds, .19 ahead of the Germans.\n\nThe men's team cruised to a win in 37.47 seconds despite an awkward first exchange. Christian Coleman handed off to Fred Kerley with his right hand, while grabbing Kerley's wrist with his left to make sure the stick was secure.\n\nKerley, Kyree King and Courtney Lindsey sped off with the win from there, and the U.S. beat South Africa by nearly half a second. Two of the country's best sprinters, Noah Lyles and Kenny Bednarek, were absent from the lineup as they prepare for the 200-meter final Thursday night.\n\nJamaica, which won all three Olympic relays when Usain Bolt was in the mix, looked like a much different team this time.

Usain Bolt accomplished that feat at three Olympics in a row -- in Beijing in 2008, London in 2012 and Rio de Janeiro in 2016.\n\nLyles was crowned the \"Fastest Man Alive\" by edging out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by five-thousandths of a second. He was a heavy favorite in the 200 -- his better race -- though he trailed Letsile Tebogo of Botswana in Wednesday night's qualifying heat.\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone of the United States and Femke Bol of the Netherlands will go head-to-head in the 400-meter hurdles final.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone is the world record holder and reigning Olympic champion. She beat Bol at the Tokyo Olympics, then again at 2022 world championships. Bol, the reigning world champion, ran an inspired anchor leg for the Dutch to win gold in the 4x400-meter mixed relay on Saturday.\n\nNo double for Noah Lyles, settles for bronze in 200\n\nThere will be no golden double for American sprinter Noah Lyles.\n\nThe 100-meter champion could only salvage bronze in the men's 200-meter final.\n\nLetsile Tebogo of Botswana earned the gold with a time of 19.46. Tebogo was in control the whole way, beating silver medalist Kenneth Bednarek by a stride.\n\nLyles, who raced out onto the track trying to amp up the crowd, held on for third. He fell to the track in the immediate aftermath and was tended to by trainers before getting up and walking over to a nearby bench.\n\nMihambo's challenge: Winning consecutive golds in long jump\n\nDefending Olympic long jump champion Malaika Mihambo of Germany has history working against her as she looks to defend her title in the women's final.\n\nNo woman has won consecutive golds in the event since it was introduced at the 1948 London Games.\n\nGerman great Heike Drechsler is the only two-time Olympic champion. She reached the top of the podium in 1992 in Barcelona and again in Sydney eight years later. Drechsler began her Olympic career with a silver in 1988 while competing for East Germany.\n\nThe long jump final is part of a busy night at Stade de France that will include the men's 200-meter and women's 400-meter hurdles final.\n\nSha'Carri Richardson to the rescue\n\nSha'Carri Richardson bailed out the U.S. women out from a near collapse earlier Thursday in the Olympic 4x100 relay, overcoming a German runner in the anchor leg to help the Americans win their heat and move to the gold-medal race.\n\nThe U.S. men, who haven't won a medal in this event since 2004, advanced easily despite a small hiccup. In the strangest twist of all, it was Jamaica's men who struggled with the baton and will be sitting on the sideline for Friday's final.\n\nIn the women's race, Richardson was about three steps behind after receiving the baton from Gabby Thomas, who earlier nearly misconnected on her exchange with Twanisha Terry.\n\nThat put Richardson in a hole against Rebekka Haase, but the 100-meter silver medal winner was looking back at Haase by the finish. The U.S. won in 41.94 seconds, .19 ahead of the Germans.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Richardson previously earned the silver medal in the 100-meter dash.\n\nRichardson overcame runners from Britain and Germany, to help the U.S. finish in 41.78 seconds, good for a .07-second win over Britain, which struggled with two baton changes in the rain.\n\nGabby Thomas ran the third leg and got her second gold of the Games, this one going with the 200-meter title. Twanisha Terry and 100 bronze medalist Melissa Jefferson rounded out the team.\n\nThe sprinting star played a key role in the American team just making it into the final.\n\nShe saved the American women with her anchor leg in the opening heat after a bad exchange between Thomas and Terry. The U.S. women won that heat, which made them a favorite in the final.\n\nNo team came into the qualifying race with a more loaded lineup that the U.S. women, but it all nearly cratered when Thomas took off early on the third leg, then had to slow down to receive the baton from Terry.\n\nBoth sprinters appeared to have their hand on the baton as Thomas crossed over the yellow line marking the end of the passing zone, which would make it a legal pass.\n\nRichardson did not earn a spot in the 200-meter race after finishing fourth at the U.S. track trials earlier this summer. That made the 100-meter dash Richardson's only spot at an individual Olympic medal in Paris.\n\nThe 24-year-old was beat by Julien Alfred, who gave Saint Lucia its first ever Olympic medal with her victory. Alfred got off to a fantastic start, then powered through the rain and beat Richardson by .15 seconds -- about three body lengths.\n\nIt was the biggest margin in the women's Olympic 100 since 2008.", "source": {"uri": "cbs8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "cbs8.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@cbs8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha'Carri_Richardson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sha'Carri Richardson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relay race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Jefferson_(athlete)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Jefferson (athlete)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Thomas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gabrielle Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twanisha_Terry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twanisha Terry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_leg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anchor leg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Alfred", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julien Alfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.cbs8.com/assets/CCT/images/d7dcf595-014f-47b3-aa5b-6d62c752da03/20240809T174252/d7dcf595-014f-47b3-aa5b-6d62c752da03_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801125", "eventUri": "eng-9801125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone of the United States went head-to-head with Femke Bol of the Netherlands in the 400-meter hurdles final.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone is the world record holder and reigning Olympic champion. She beat Bol at the Tokyo Olympics, then again at 2022 world championships. Bol, the reigning world champion, ran an inspired anchor leg for the Dutch to win gold in the 4x400-meter mixed relay on Saturday.\n\nAmerican sprinter Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone broke her own world record in winning the women's 400-meter hurdle final.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone ran away from the rest of the field, posting a time of 50.37, easily breaking the Olympic mark of 51.46 she set in Tokyo three years ago and just ahead of the 50.65 she put up at the U.S. Olympic trials earlier this year.\n\nAnna Cockrell of the U.S. was second at 51.87, with Femke Bol of the Netherlands in third at 52.15.\n\nBoth were well behind McLaughlin-Levrone, who was around 10 meters in front of everyone else when she hit the tape.\n\nAmerican sprinting star Noah Lyles is dealing with COVID-19.\n\nThe men's 100-meter champion was diagnosed with COVID two days before the 200-meter final, a source close to the situation told the AP.\n\nLyles seemed to be his typical amped-up self during introductions. He couldn't quite keep pace with gold medalist Letsile Tebogo or American teammate Kenny Bednarek, who grabbed silver.\n\nLyles held on for bronze then fell to the track afterward.\n\nLetsile Tebogo of Botswana earned the gold with a time of 19.46. Tebogo was in control the whole way, beating silver medalist Kenneth Bednarek by a stride.\n\nLyles, who raced out onto the track trying to amp up the crowd, held on for third. He fell to the track in the immediate aftermath and was tended to by trainers before getting up and walking over to a nearby bench.\n\nLyles had edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by five-thousandths of a second in the 100. He was a heavy favorite in the 200 -- his better race -- though he trailed Tebogo in Wednesday's qualifying heat.\n\nDefending Olympic long jump champion Malaika Mihambo of Germany has history working against her as she looks to defend her title in the women's final.\n\nNo woman has won consecutive golds in the event since it was introduced at the 1948 London Games.\n\nGerman great Heike Drechsler is the only two-time Olympic champion. She reached the top of the podium in 1992 in Barcelona and again in Sydney eight years later. Drechsler began her Olympic career with a silver in 1988 while competing for East Germany.\n\nThe long jump final is part of a busy night at Stade de France that will include the men's 200-meter and women's 400-meter hurdles final.\n\nSha'Carri Richardson bailed out the U.S. women out from a near collapse earlier Thursday in the Olympic 4x100 relay, overcoming a German runner in the anchor leg to help the Americans win their heat and move to the gold-medal race.\n\nThe U.S. men, who haven't won a medal in this event since 2004, advanced easily despite a small hiccup. In the strangest twist of all, it was Jamaica's men who struggled with the baton and will be sitting on the sideline for Friday's final.\n\nIn the women's race, Richardson was about three steps behind after receiving the baton from Gabby Thomas, who earlier nearly misconnected on her exchange with Twanisha Terry.\n\nThat put Richardson in a hole against Rebekka Haase, but the 100-meter silver medal winner was looking back at Haase by the finish.

Usain Bolt accomplished that feat at three Olympics in a row -- in Beijing in 2008, London in 2012 and Rio de Janeiro in 2016.\n\nLyles was crowned the \"Fastest Man Alive\" by edging out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by five-thousandths of a second. He is a heavy favorite in the 200 -- his better race -- though he trailed Letsile Tebogo of Botswana in Wednesday night's qualifying heat.\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone of the United States and Femke Bol of the Netherlands will go head-to-head in the 400-meter hurdles final.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone is the world record holder and reigning Olympic champion.

Bol, the reigning world champion, ran an inspired anchor leg for the Dutch to win gold in the 4x400-meter mixed relay on Saturday.\n\nMihambo's challenge: Winning consecutive golds in long jump\n\nDefending Olympic long jump champion Malaika Mihambo of Germany has history working against her as she looks to defend her title in the women's final.\n\nNo woman has won consecutive golds in the event since it was introduced at the 1948 London Games.\n\nGerman great Heike Drechsler is the only two-time Olympic champion. She reached the top of the podium in 1992 in Barcelona and again in Sydney eight years later. Drechsler began her Olympic career with a silver in 1988 while competing for East Germany.\n\nThe long jump final is part of a busy night at Stade de France that will include the men's 200-meter and women's 400-meter hurdles final.\n\nSha'Carri Richardson to the rescue\n\nSha'Carri Richardson bailed out the U.S. women out from a near collapse earlier Thursday in the Olympic 4x100 relay, overcoming a German runner in the anchor leg to help the Americans win their heat and move to the gold-medal race.\n\nThe U.S. men, who haven't won a medal in this event since 2004, advanced easily despite a small hiccup. In the strangest twist of all, it was Jamaica's men who struggled with the baton and will be sitting on the sideline for Friday's final.\n\nIn the women's race, Richardson was about three steps behind after receiving the baton from Gabby Thomas, who earlier nearly misconnected on her exchange with Twanisha Terry.\n\nThat put Richardson in a hole against Rebekka Haase, but the 100-meter silver medal winner was looking back at Haase by the finish. The U.S. won in 41.94 seconds, .19 ahead of the Germans.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It was the first medal in Paris for De Grasse, but his seventh overall. South Africa finished second and Britain third.\n\nRelated Story: Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone Breaks Her Own World Record, Wins Olympic Gold Again ...\n\nEarlier, Sha'Carri Richardson won her first Olympic gold medal, bringing the Americans from behind in the anchor lap to capture the 4\u00d7100 relay.\n\nIn the men's race, even without Noah Lyles, who was out of the lineup due to COVID, this looked like America's race to lose. They have knack for doing just that. The only time the U.S. has captured a medal over the last two decades was in 2012, but that got stripped for a doping violation.\n\nIt's mostly been scenes like this. Coleman first ran into, then passed, Bednarek as they made their awkward exchange.\n\nRelated Story: In Olympic Relay, Sha'Carri Richardson Saves US Women, While Men Advance ...\n\nThe women ran their lap cleanly.\n\nRichardson, the 100-meter silver medalist, overcame runners from Britain and Germany, to help the U.S. finish in 41.78 seconds, good for a .07-second win over Britain, which struggled with two baton changes in the rain.\n\nGabby Thomas ran the third leg and got her second gold of the Games, this one going with the 200-meter title. Twanisha Terry and 100 bronze medalist Melissa Jefferson rounded out the team. The exchange between Terry and Thomas that nearly wrecked the Americans in qualifying was better this time.\n\nStill, when Thomas handed off to Richardson, the U.S. was in third.\n\nRichardson had to reel in Daryll Neita (Britain) and Rebekka Haase (Germany), and when she did, she flashed a look to her right -- and backward -- that said ''you're not catching me.\"\n\nShe sprinted eight more steps down the track, and on her ninth, lifted her left leg high and stomped it on the other side of the finish line, then let out a scream.\n\nRelated Story: Harvard Graduate Gabby Thomas Sprints to

Germany (42.15) and Switzerland (42.38) also qualified for the final, set for 12:30 p.m. CDT Friday.\n\nThe U.S. relay team got off to a strong start in the relay, with Melissa Jefferson making up much of the stagger before handing off to Terry. But on her exchange with Thomas, the 200-meter gold medalist appeared to take off early and nearly ran out of the exchange zone.\n\nThomas had to slow down to grab the baton, giving up the lead to Germany with the anchor leg to go. When Thomas handed the baton to Richardson in turn four, the former LSU sprinter trailed Germany's Rebekka Haase.\n\nBut not for long. Despite the early deficit, Richardson sprinted past Haase to win by a couple of meters, credited with a split time of 9.99 seconds.\n\nRichardson is seeking her first Olympic gold medal after getting the silver in the women's 100, her signature event, finishing second to St. Lucia's Julien Alfred.\n\nLeft off the USA's preliminary team was another former LSU All-American, Aleia Hobbs of New Orleans. She was one of five runners listed as part of the U.S. pool on Wednesday, but Thomas made it six Thursday morning and got one of the four assignments.\n\nNone of the American runners spoke to reporters after the race. A US Track and Field representative accompanying the runners through the media mixed zone did not provide any information on Hobbs' status, nor whether she might run a leg in Friday's final.\n\nNigeria's relay squad, despite posting a season-best time of 42.77, did not advance out of the second semifinal.\n\nThe Nigerians, with LSU's Favour Ofili running the second leg and fellow Tiger Tima Godbless the anchor, finished sixth. The top five teams from their semifinal advanced: Great Britain (42.03), France (42.13), 2020 gold medal-winning relay team Jamaica (42.35), Canada (42.50) and The Netherlands (42.64).\n\nIn the men's 4x100 heats, Great Britain with former LSU Tiger Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake running the anchor leg also advanced. The British finished third in a season-best 38.04 to automatically qualify.\n\n\"Job done,\" Mitchell-Blake said after the heat. \"Made it to the finals, the main objective. I'm confident in our abilities. We can step it up and walk away with gold.\"\n\nThe United States, with men's 100-meter bronze medalist Fred Kerley running the second leg, won the first heat in 37.47. South Africa finished second (37.94), while fourth-place Japan (38.06) and fifth-place Italy (38.07) also advanced on time.\n\nIn the second heat, China (38.24), France (38.34) and Canada (38.39) took the automatic qualifying spots.\n\nNigeria's men did not advance, finishing seventh in the first heat with a season-best time of 38.20.

The U.S. was disqualified for an illegal pass.\n\nIt was a more-of-the-same result for a team that raced without 100-meter champion Noah Lyles, who pulled out of the Olympics with COVID. Even without Lyles, the speed of the Americans made it their race to lose.\n\nThey always find a way.\n\n\"It just didn't happen,\" Coleman said. \"Maybe we could have put in some more work. I just think in the moment it didn't happen.\"\n\nAndre De Grasse put a bright mark on an otherwise disappointing Olympics by anchoring Canada to gold in a time of 37.50 seconds. It was the first medal in Paris for De Grasse, but his seventh overall.

Twanisha Terry and 100 bronze medalist Melissa Jefferson rounded out the team.

A day earlier in qualifying, Coleman handed to Kerley with his right hand while grabbing Kerley's arm with his left - an awkward exchange that didn't cost anything.\n\nThis one did.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we knew what we could do,\" said Kyree King, who was mired in seventh place when he finished the third leg of a race where the U.S. would end up with a 'DQ.' \"We came out here and we had the mindset of no risk, no reward, so we went out there and went big.

Some self-imposed. Some not.\n\nConsidering all the American sprinter has been through over the last three years, tentatively grabbing the baton from teammate Gabby Thomas with the U.S. in third in the women's 4x100 meter relay final on Friday felt sort of normal.\n\nBeating others in a race from here to there is what Richardson does for a living. And with one thrilling dash down the final stretch in Stade de France, the gold that had been just out of reach for so long finally became tangible.\n\nRichardson chased down Germany's Rebekka Haase and Britain's Daryll Neita during an electrifying final leg to lock down the first Olympic gold of her career. And she did it with the style and swagger that's become her signature, win or lose.\n\nShe caught Haase and Neita with 40 meters to go. With 20 meters left, Richardson turned to her right and glared at her competitors, each now a full step behind. At the finish line she leaned forward and high-stepped.\n\nThe 24-year-old from Dallas went so fast, it took a moment for the scoreboard to catch up.\n\nThe initial results on the massive videoboard indicated Britain had hit the line first. Richardson, Thomas, Twanisha Terry and Melissa Jefferson knew better. When the mistake was fixed -- with a one next to the U.S.'s time of 41.78 -- Richardson's long journey to the top of the podium was finally over.\n\n\"It was a phenomenal feeling for all of us,\" Richardson said.\n\nEspecially for the charismatic star who arrived in Paris with so much pressure.\n\nWhen the Americans headed to ring the victory bell in a corner of the stadium, Richardson went last and tugged at it four times while letting out a scream of joy that was a long time coming.\n\nA week after finishing a surprise runner-up to Julien Alfred of St. Lucia in the women's 100 final, Richardson authored a golden finish to her Games a day after shaky exchange between Terry and Thomas in qualifying nearly cost the U.S. a chance at winning the program's third gold in the last four Olympics.\n\n\"We just looked at what we did yesterday, had a talk amongst each other, then make the necessary corrections going in,\" Terry said. \"But we still had trust and confidence in one another. And that's what we've brought out here today.\"\n\nThomas ran the third leg and earned her second gold of the Games to go with the one she breezed to in the 200. Things were considerably harder during a brief rainstorm that began just before the start, briefly making things slick on the purple track, one of the reasons Thomas' exchange with Richardson was more cautious than clinical.\n\nNot that it mattered in the end.\n\n\"Passing the baton to Sha'Carri is a very special and unique thing,\" Thomas said. \"She's so fast and we know we're in good hands as soon as she gets her hands on the baton.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Richardson previously earned the silver medal in the 100-meter dash.\n\nThe sprinting star played a key role in the American team just making it into the final.\n\nShe saved the American women with her anchor leg in the opening heat after a bad exchange between 200-meter gold medalist Gabby Thomas and Twanisha Terry. The U.S. women won that heat, which made them a favorite in the final.\n\nNo team came into the qualifying race with a more loaded lineup that the U.S. women, but it all nearly cratered when Thomas took off early on the third leg, then had to slow down to receive the baton from Terry.\n\nBoth sprinters appeared to have their hand on the baton as Thomas crossed over the yellow line marking the end of the passing zone, which would make it a legal pass.\n\nRichardson did not earn a spot in the 200-meter race after finishing fourth at the U.S. track trials earlier this summer. That made the 100-meter dash Richardson's only spot at an individual Olympic medal in Paris.\n\nThe 24-year-old was beat by Julien Alfred, who gave Saint Lucia its first ever Olympic medal with her victory. Alfred got off to a fantastic start, then powered through the rain and beat Richardson by .15 seconds -- about three body lengths.\n\nIt was the biggest margin in the women's Olympic 100 since 2008.", "source": {"uri": "11alive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WXIA-TV 11"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha'Carri_Richardson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sha'Carri Richardson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Thomas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gabrielle Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twanisha_Terry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twanisha Terry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_leg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anchor leg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relay race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Alfred", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julien Alfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://media.11alive.com/assets/CCT/images/fef2a675-cdec-4a48-99b0-dabc5fd33266/20240803T191123/fef2a675-cdec-4a48-99b0-dabc5fd33266_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801125", "eventUri": "eng-9801125", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

She put that face on full display as the anchor of the women's 4x100m relay team on Friday.\n\nThe U.S. women took home gold in the 4x100 relay thanks to a fantastic closing burst from Richardson. She turned on the jets in the final leg to put the U.S. on top of the podium, and in the process she provided us with one of the great viral images of these Olympics. First, watch Richardson win the race for the United States here:\n\nNow let's enjoy the memes.\n\nAs Richardson was pulling ahead, she looked over to her right to make sure she was ahead of Great Britain, which took home the silver medal. The face she made while doing so is already iconic.\n\nRichardson had already won a silver medal in the women's 100 meter dash earlier in the Olympics. Now she has her first Olympic gold medal.\n\nRichardson didn't do it by herself. Melissa Jefferson, Twanisha Terry, and Gabby Thomas already starred for the gold medal team.

Great Britain got the silver medal with a time of 41.85 and Germany took the bronze (41.97).\n\nIt's the United States' 17th medal in this event all-time and 12th gold.\n\nRichardson was the favorite in the 100 entering Paris and one of the most recognizable athletes in these Olympic games. Pop singer Adele stopped her concert in Munich, Germany, to show the women's 100 final on giant video boards in the concert hall.\n\nBut a slow start kept her from catching up with gold medalist Julien Alfred of St. Lucia. That left the 4x100 to make Richardson's golden dreams come true.\n\nThe Americans had to overcome a close call in the qualifying heats Wednesday just to reach the final. Gabby Thomas, the 200-meter gold medalist, appeared to take off early on her baton handoff from Twanisha Terry, nearly running out of the exchange zone and leaving the U.S. trailing Germany by the time Richardson got the baton for the anchor leg.\n\nRichardson sped past Germany's Rebekka Haase with a split time of 9.99 seconds to win the heat and put the USA back in the final.\n\nThere was more drama in the final. Like for the women's 100 final, rain started to fall on the track just before the race. And the exchange between Thomas and Richardson wasn't the cleanest.\n\nBut Richardson overcame the elements and the nerves to win.\n\nFormer LSU All-American Aleia Hobbs of New Orleans was in the pool for the 4x100 but did not run in either qualifying or the final. The U.S. ran the same four runners in the final as it did in qualifying and in the same order: Melissa Jefferson, Terry, Thomas and Richardson.\n\nThe medal ceremony is scheduled for 3:08 p.m. CDT.",

She beat Bol at the Tokyo Olympics, then again at 2022 world championships. Bol, the reigning world champion, ran an inspired anchor leg for the Dutch to win gold in the 4x400-meter mixed relay on Saturday.\n\nAmerican sprinting star Noah Lyles is dealing with COVID-19.\n\nThe men's 100-meter champion was diagnosed with COVID two days before the 200-meter final, a source close to the situation told the AP.\n\nLyles seemed to be his typical amped-up self during introductions. He couldn't quite keep pace with gold medalist Letsile Tebogo or American teammate Kenny Bednarek, who grabbed silver.\n\nLyles held on for bronze then fell to the track afterward.\n\nLetsile Tebogo of Botswana earned the gold with a time of 19.46. Tebogo was in control the whole way, beating silver medalist Kenneth Bednarek by a stride.\n\nLyles, who raced out onto the track trying to amp up the crowd, held on for third. He fell to the track in the immediate aftermath and was tended to by trainers before getting up and walking over to a nearby bench.\n\nLyles had edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by five-thousandths of a second in the 100. He was a heavy favorite in the 200 -- his better race -- though he trailed Tebogo in Wednesday's qualifying heat.\n\nDefending Olympic long jump champion Malaika Mihambo of Germany has history working against her as she looks to defend her title in the women's final.\n\nNo woman has won consecutive golds in the event since it was introduced at the 1948 London Games.\n\nGerman great Heike Drechsler is the only two-time Olympic champion. She reached the top of the podium in 1992 in Barcelona and again in Sydney eight years later. Drechsler began her Olympic career with a silver in 1988 while competing for East Germany.\n\nThe long jump final is part of a busy night at Stade de France that will include the men's 200-meter and women's 400-meter hurdles final.\n\nSha'Carri Richardson bailed out the U.S. women out from a near collapse earlier Thursday in the Olympic 4x100 relay, overcoming a German runner in the anchor leg to help the Americans win their heat and move to the gold-medal race.\n\nThe U.S. men, who haven't won a medal in this event since 2004, advanced easily despite a small hiccup. In the strangest twist of all, it was Jamaica's men who struggled with the baton and will be sitting on the sideline for Friday's final.\n\nIn the women's race, Richardson was about three steps behind after receiving the baton from Gabby Thomas, who earlier nearly misconnected on her exchange with Twanisha Terry.\n\nThat put Richardson in a hole against Rebekka Haase, but the 100-meter silver medal winner was looking back at Haase by the finish.

It was the first medal in Paris for De Grasse, but his seventh overall. South Africa finished second and Britain third.\n\nEarlier, Sha'Carri Richardson won her first Olympic gold medal, bringing the Americans from behind in the anchor lap to capture the 4x100 relay.\n\nIn the men's race, even without Noah Lyles, who was out of the lineup due to COVID, this looked like America's race to lose. They have knack for doing just that. The only time the U.S. has captured a medal over the last two decades was in 2012, but that got stripped for a doping violation.\n\nIt's mostly been scenes like this. Coleman first ran into, then passed, Bednarek as they made their awkward exchange.\n\nThe women ran their lap cleanly.\n\nRichardson, the 100-meter silver medalist, overcame runners from Britain and Germany, to help the U.S. finish in 41.78 seconds, good for a .07-second win over Britain, which struggled with two baton changes in the rain.\n\nGabby Thomas ran the third leg and got her second gold of the Games, this one going with the 200-meter title. Twanisha Terry and 100 bronze medalist Melissa Jefferson rounded out the team.

reel in Daryll Neita (Britain) and Rebekka Haase (Germany), and when she did, she flashed a look to her right -- and backward -- that said ''you're not catching me.\"\n\nShe sprinted eight more steps down the track, and on her ninth, lifted her left leg high and stomped it on the other side of the finish line, then let out a scream.\n\nIt marked a sweet close to the Olympics for Richardson, who

The U.S. was disqualified for an illegal pass.\n\nIt was a more-of-the-same result for a team that raced without 100-meter champion Noah Lyles, who pulled out of the Olympics with COVID. Even without Lyles, the speed of the Americans made it their race to lose.\n\nThey always find a way.\n\n\"It just didn't happen,\" Coleman said. \"Maybe we could have put in some more work. I just think in the moment it didn't happen.\"\n\nAndre De Grasse put a bright mark on an otherwise disappointing Olympics by anchoring Canada to gold in a time of 37.50 seconds. It was the first medal in Paris for De Grasse, but his seventh overall. South Africa finished second and Britain third.\n\nThe run by Richardson and her teammates was everything the men's race was not -- filled with smooth safe passes of a rain-slickened baton, then capped off by America's fastest 100-meter runner.\n\nThe silver medalist from the 100 received the baton from Thomas in third place. By the halfway point of her leg, Richardson had overcome runners from Britain and Germany. She glanced to her right -- and backwards -- and gave a look of \"you're not catching me,\" then took eight more steps. On the ninth one, Richardson slammed her left foot on the ground over the finish line and let out a yell.\n\nSign Up for Pikes Peak 5 Game analysis and insights from The Gazette sports staff including columns by Woody Paige and Paul Klee.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Featured Local Savings\n\nThe Americans won in 41.78 seconds, good for a .07-second win over Britain, which struggled with two baton changes in the rain.\n\n\"The moment that I would describe is realizing that when we won as USA ladies, it was a phenomenal feeling for all of us,\" Richardson said.\n\nGabby Thomas ran the third leg and got her second gold of the Games, this one going with the 200-meter title. Twanisha Terry and 100 bronze medalist Melissa Jefferson rounded out the team. The exchange between Terry and Thomas that nearly wrecked the Americans in qualifying was better this time.\n\nIt marked a sweet close to the Olympics for Richardson, who came into the Olympics as a favorite but surprisingly fell to Julien Alfred of St. Lucia.\n\nFor the men, just another bad pass that will certainly lead to four more years of questions about a program that cannot get its act together.\n\nSome might blame it on what a late lineup change. Lyles, who ran anchor in the U.S. victory last year at world championships, probably would have done so again at Stade de France.\n\nBut that task went to Kerley, and Bednarek ran second. It set him up to receive the pass from Coleman. A day earlier in qualifying, Coleman handed to Kerley with his right hand while grabbing Kerley's arm with his left -- an awkward exchange that didn't cost anything.\n\nThis one did.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we knew what we could do,\" said Kyree King, who was mired in seventh place when he finished the third leg of a race where the U.S. would end up with a 'DQ.' \"We came out here and we had the mindset of no risk, no reward, so we went out there and went big. It didn't happen.\"\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eddie_pells@gazette.com", "name": "Eddie Pells", "type":

Usain Bolt accomplished that feat at three Olympics in a row -- in Beijing in 2008, London in 2012 and Rio de Janeiro in 2016.\n\nLyles was crowned the \"Fastest Man Alive\" by edging out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by five-thousandths of a second. He is a heavy favorite in the 200 -- his better race -- though he trailed Letsile Tebogo of Botswana in Wednesday night's qualifying heat.\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone of the United States and Femke Bol of the Netherlands will go head-to-head in the 400-meter hurdles final.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone is the world record holder and reigning Olympic champion. She beat Bol at the Tokyo Olympics, then again at 2022 world championships. Bol, the reigning world champion, ran an inspired anchor leg for the Dutch to win gold in the 4x400-meter mixed relay on Saturday.\n\nDefending Olympic long jump champion Malaika Mihambo of Germany has history working against her as she looks to defend her title in the women's final.\n\nNo woman has won consecutive golds in the event since it was introduced at the 1948 London Games.\n\nGerman great Heike Drechsler is the only two-time Olympic champion. She reached the top of the podium in 1992 in Barcelona and again in Sydney eight years later. Drechsler began her Olympic career with a silver in 1988 while competing for East Germany.\n\nThe long jump final is part of a busy night at Stade de France that will include the men's 200-meter and women's 400-meter hurdles final.\n\nSha'Carri Richardson bailed out the U.S. women out from a near collapse earlier Thursday in the Olympic 4x100 relay, overcoming a German runner in the anchor leg to help the Americans win their heat and move to the gold-medal race.\n\nThe U.S. men, who haven't won a medal in this event since 2004, advanced easily despite a small hiccup. In the strangest twist of all, it was Jamaica's men who struggled with the baton and will be sitting on the sideline for Friday's final.\n\nIn the women's race, Richardson was about three steps behind after receiving the baton from Gabby Thomas, who earlier nearly misconnected on her exchange with Twanisha Terry.\n\nThat put Richardson in a hole against Rebekka Haase, but the 100-meter silver medal winner was looking back at Haase by the finish.

Petr David Josek/Associated Press\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France -- For Sha'Carri Richardson, this was a beautiful relay through the rain.\n\nThe only shame was that she couldn't stay out there to help the men's team win, too.\n\nRichardson captured her first Olympic gold medal with a come-from-behind anchor leg for the United States in the Olympic 4\u00d7100 on Friday, then stepped aside to watch the U.S. men extend their streak to 20 years without a medal at the Games.\n\nThis year's mishap happened quickly, on the first exchange, when Christian Coleman crashed into Kenny Bednarek, then actually passed him as they were awkwardly passing the baton. The U.S. was disqualified for an illegal pass.\n\nIt was a more-of-the-same result for a team that raced without 100-meter champion Noah Lyles, who pulled out of the Olympics with COVID. Even without Lyles, the speed of the Americans made it their race to lose.\n\nThey always find a way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It just didn't happen,\" Coleman said. \"Maybe we could have put in some more work. I just think in the moment it didn't happen.\"\n\nAndre De Grasse put a bright mark on an otherwise disappointing Olympics by anchoring Canada to gold in a time of 37.50 seconds. It was the first medal in Paris for De Grasse, but his seventh overall. South Africa finished second and Britain third.\n\nThe run by Richardson and her teammates was everything the men's race was not -- filled with smooth safe passes of a rain-slickened baton, then capped off by America's fastest 100-meter runner.\n\nThe silver medalist from the 100 received the baton from Thomas in third place. By the halfway point of her leg, Richardson had overcome runners from Britain and Germany. She glanced to her right -- and backwards -- and gave a look of \"you're not catching me,\" then took eight more steps. On the ninth one, Richardson slammed her left foot on the ground over the finish line and let out a yell.\n\nThe Americans won in 41.78 seconds, good for a .07-second win over Britain, which struggled with two baton changes in the rain.\n\n\"The moment that I would describe is realizing that when we won as USA ladies, it was a phenomenal feeling for all of us,\" Richardson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGabby Thomas ran the third leg and got her second gold of the Games, this one going with the 200-meter title. Twanisha Terry and 100 bronze medalist Melissa Jefferson rounded out the team. The exchange between Terry and Thomas that nearly wrecked the Americans in qualifying was better this time.\n\nWEIGHTLIFTING: Olivia Reeves won the United States' first Olympic gold medal in weightlifting in 24 years.\n\nReeves lifted 117 kilograms (390 pounds) in the snatch and 145kg (320 pounds) in the clean and jerk for a total of 262kg to beat Mari Leivis Sanchez of Colombia by five kilograms in the women's 71kg division. Angie Dajomes of Ecuador took the bronze.\n\nThe U.S. last won an Olympic gold medal in weightlifting in Sydney in 2000, when Tara Nott won the lightest women's division. That was the first Olympic Games to include women's weightlifting on the program.\n\nMEN'S SOCCER: Sergio Camello struck twice in extra time as Spain took gold in the Olympic men's soccer final after a 5-3 win against France.\n\nThe thrilling win at Parc des Princes completed a golden summer for Spanish soccer -- following the senior team's European Championship triumph last month.\n\nSpain, which lost the final to Brazil at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, became the first European gold medalist in men's soccer since it last won the tournament at the Barcelona Games in 1992.\n\nWOMEN'S SOCCER: Ann-Katrin Berger saved a last-minute penalty and Germany won the bronze medal with a 1-0 victory over Women's World Cup winner Spain.\n\nWOMEN'S FIELD HOCKEY: The Netherlands defended its title, rallying from an early deficit to beat China 2-1 in a shootout in the final.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are no longer available on this story\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nLatest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olympic_roundup@pressherald.com", "name": "Olympic Roundup", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [], "image": "https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/08/AP24222636467079-1723233518.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801125", "eventUri": "eng-9801125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The group finished with a time of 41.78 seconds.\n\nGreat Britain earned the silver medal, while Germany is going home with the bronze.\n\nOn paper, Team GB was the biggest threat to the U.S. women. The Brits won one of the two heats in Thursday's prelims. But in the finals, the Americans beat them by .07.\n\nAnd about those prelims. The U.S. women had a difficult time in the opening round. It wasn't their speed, but the handoffs. The exchange with Sha'Carri Richardson, the silver medalist in the 100, was shaky. But she turned on the jets and made up the deficit on Germany's Rebekka Haase. The Americans won the heat.\n\nCircling back to the finals, Team GB was the one who needed to overcome bad handoffs. Meanwhile, Jamaica had been the defending gold medalists. In Tokyo, their women's team featured the entire podium from the 100 meters. But none of those three women competed in the 100 meters earlier this week.\n\nThe U.S. men suffered through a far different result. Kenny Bednarek, the silver medalist from the 200 meters, left too early on the second exchange. That slowed the entire relay. Then after the finish, the Americans learned they'd been disqualified. not a good result as the Olympic track competition winds down.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_connolly@on3.com", "name": "Matt Connolly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha'Carri_Richardson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sha'Carri Richardson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relay race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Jefferson_(athlete)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Jefferson (athlete)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Thomas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gabrielle Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebekka_Haase", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebekka Haase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver_and_Flatware", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver and Flatware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/08/09131606/ShaCarri-Richardson.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801125", "eventUri": "eng-9801125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Moments ago, the American track star led Team USA to a thrilling victory in the 4x100m relay in Paris.\n\nRichardson was the anchor leg for Team USA. After watching this relay race unfold, it's safe to say that was a wise decision.\n\nTeam USA had some ground to make up since Great Britain and Germany were out in front through the first few legs. Once Richardson received the baton from Gabby Thomas though, it was all over for the rest of the field.\n\nRichardson legitimately zoomed past the competition and even gave her opponents a side eye before sealing the deal for her country.\n\nAs soon as Richardson crossed the finish line she let out a loud roar. It was an awesome celebration from the world champion.\n\nCheck out the finish in the 4x100m final:\n\nThat staredown from Richardson might go down as the coldest moment of the Paris Olympics.\n\nRichardson now has two Olympic medals on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. She won silver in the 100m earlier this month.\n\nWe'd have to imagine Richardson will make a run at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.

With the eliteness of the American sprinters -- Melissa Jefferson handing to Twanisha Terry, handing to Gabby Thomas -- you wouldn't think she'd need to come from behind. But thanks to a rough final exchange on ths this wet Friday night at Stade de France, that's exactly what Richardson had to do.\n\nRun, Sha'Carri. Run.\n\nShe surged past both nations with a 10.09-second anchor leg, giving the U.S. first place with a time of 41.78 and securing her first Olympic gold medal. Thomas picked up her second gold medal of the Olympics. Jefferson now has a bronze and a silver. And Terry picked up her first gold.\n\nThomas' third leg was smooth, as you'd expect, but she had a difficult time getting the baton to Richardson, who slowed to make sure to not drop it. This gave Germany and Great Britain the lead. But the silver medalist in the 100 meters turned in a blistering final 100 in the relay.\n\nThis was America's third consecutive major international championship, including the 2022 and 2023 world championship victories. It punctuated the United States' dominant display in women's sprints. Three of the four, with Tamari Davis in place of Jefferson, ran a 41.59 in last year's world championship.\n\nThe U.S. won gold and bronze in the 200, silver and bronze in the 100, gold and silver in the 400-meter hurdles, and now gold in the relay. America also has Alexis Holmes in the women's 400 and three in the 100-meter hurdles: Masai Russell, Alayshia Johnson and Grace Stark.\n\nThe 4\u00d7100 relay is usually a massive rivalry with the Jamaicans. But their sprinters were unavailable. Elaine Thompson-Herah was forced out last month by an injury.

What color that medal would be depended solely on one person: Sha'Carri Richardson.\n\nOver the course of the next 10 seconds or so, Richardson turned the Stade de France into her stage, prancing across the wet and wild track to the tune of 10.09s split -- eight-tenths of a second faster than her silver-medal showing in the women's 100m.\n\nThe result? A glimmering canary medallion, one which will now dangle across Richardson's neck for time immemorial.

She was fluid in her movement in her opening few paces. Then, Richardson pounced, increasing her tempo to race out in front of Neita. Richardson knew she had her adversary beat. And as she paced herself in front, acres of daylight in front of her, Richardson gave Neita a glance.\n\nIt was the same glance Richardson gave her opponents when she vanquished all foes during the prelims.\n\nMORE: Andre De Grasse anchors Canada to gold in 4x100m men's relay\n\nShe crossed the finish line in a heap, letting off a scream of celebration as the U.S.'s time flashed across the screen.

They have knack for doing just that. The only time the U.S. has captured a medal over the last two decades was in 2012, but that got stripped for a doping violation.\n\nAlso Read | France vs Spain Paris Olympics 2024 Gold Medal Match Free Live Streaming and Match Time in IST: How to Watch Free Live Telecast of FRA U-23 vs ESP U-23 Final on TV and Online Stream Details of Men's Football Match in India.\n\nIt's mostly been scenes like this. Coleman first ran into, then passed, Bednarek as they made their awkward exchange.\n\nThe women ran their lap cleanly.\n\nRichardson, the 100-meter silver medalist, overcame runners from Britain and Germany, to help the U.S. finish in 41.78 seconds, good for a .07-second win over Britain, which struggled with two baton changes in the rain.\n\nGabby Thomas ran the third leg and got her second gold of the Games, this one going with the 200-meter title. Twanisha Terry and 100 bronze medalist Melissa Jefferson rounded out the team. The exchange between Terry and Thomas that nearly wrecked the Americans in qualifying was better this time.\n\nStill, when Thomas handed off to Richardson, the U.S. was in third.\n\nRichardson had to reel in Daryll Neita (Britain) and Rebekka Haase (Germany), and when she did, she flashed a look to her right -- and backward -- that said ?you're not catching me.\"\n\nShe sprinted eight more steps down the track, and on her ninth, lifted her left leg high and stomped it on the other side of the finish line, then let out a scream.\n\nIt marked a sweet close to the Olympics for Richardson, who came into the Olympics as a favorite but surprisingly fell to Julien Alfred of St. Lucia.

Some self-imposed. Some not.\n\nConsidering all the American sprinter has been through over the last three years, tentatively grabbing the baton from teammate Gabby Thomas with the U.S. in third in the women's 4x100 meter relay final on Friday felt sort of normal.\n\nBeating others in a race from here to there is what Richardson does for a living. And with one thrilling dash down the final stretch in Stade de France, the gold that had been just out of reach for so long finally became tangible.\n\nRichardson chased down Germany's Rebekka Haase and Britain's Daryll Neita during an electrifying final leg to lock down the first Olympic gold of her career. And she did it with the style and swagger that's become her signature, win or lose.\n\nShe caught Haase and Neita with 40 meters to go. With 20 meters left, Richardson turned to her right and glared at her competitors, each now a full step behind. At the finish line she leaned forward and high-stepped.\n\nThe 24-year-old from Dallas went so fast, it took a moment for the scoreboard to catch up.\n\nSha'carri Richardson of the United States, celebrates after winning the women's 4 x 100-meter relay final at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Friday, Aug. 9, 2024, in Saint-Denis, France. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner)\n\nThe initial results on the massive videoboard indicated Britain had hit the line first. Richardson, Thomas, Twanisha Terry and Melissa Jefferson knew better. When the mistake was fixed - with a one next to the U.S.'s time of 41.78 - Richardson's long journey to the top of the podium was finally over.\n\n\"It was a phenomenal feeling for all of us,\" Richardson said.\n\nEspecially for the charismatic star who arrived in Paris with so much pressure.\n\nWhen the Americans headed to ring the victory bell in a corner of the stadium, Richardson went last and tugged at it four times while letting out a scream of joy that was a long time coming.\n\nA week after finishing a surprise runner-up to Julien Alfred of St. Lucia in the women's 100 final, Richardson authored a golden finish to her Games a day after shaky exchange between Terry and Thomas in qualifying nearly cost the U.S. a chance at winning the program's third gold in the last four Olympics.\n\n\"We just looked at what we did yesterday, had a talk amongst each other, then make the necessary corrections going in,\" Terry said. \"But we still had trust and confidence in one another. And that\u00b4s what we\u00b4ve brought out here today.\"\n\nThomas ran the third leg and earned her second gold of the Games to go with the one she breezed to in the 200. Things were considerably harder during a brief rainstorm that began just before the start, briefly making things slick on the purple track, one of the reasons Thomas' exchange with Richardson was more cautious than clinical.\n\nNot that it mattered in the end.\n\n\"Passing the baton to Sha'Carri is a very special and unique thing,\" Thomas said. \"She's so fast and we know we're in good hands as soon as she gets her hands on the baton.\"\n\nYes, they were.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nSha'carri Richardson,Gabrielle Thomas, Twanisha Terry, and Melissa Jefferson, of the United States, pose after winning the gold medal in the women's 4 x 100 meters relay final at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Friday, Aug. 9, 2024, in Saint-Denis, France.

Petr David Josek/Associated Press\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France -- For Sha'Carri Richardson, this was a beautiful relay through the rain.\n\nThe only shame was that she couldn't stay out there to help the men's team win, too.\n\nRichardson captured her first Olympic gold medal with a come-from-behind anchor leg for the United States in the Olympic 4\u00d7100 on Friday, then stepped aside to watch the U.S. men extend their streak to 20 years without a medal at the Games.\n\nThis year's mishap happened quickly, on the first exchange, when Christian Coleman crashed into Kenny Bednarek, then actually passed him as they were awkwardly passing the baton. The U.S. was disqualified for an illegal pass.\n\nIt was a more-of-the-same result for a team that raced without 100-meter champion Noah Lyles, who pulled out of the Olympics with COVID. Even without Lyles, the speed of the Americans made it their race to lose.\n\nThey always find a way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It just didn't happen,\" Coleman said. \"Maybe we could have put in some more work. I just think in the moment it didn't happen.\"\n\nAndre De Grasse put a bright mark on an otherwise disappointing Olympics by anchoring Canada to gold in a time of 37.50 seconds. It was the first medal in Paris for De Grasse, but his seventh overall. South Africa finished second and Britain third.\n\nThe run by Richardson and her teammates was everything the men's race was not -- filled with smooth safe passes of a rain-slickened baton, then capped off by America's fastest 100-meter runner.\n\nThe silver medalist from the 100 received the baton from Thomas in third place. By the halfway point of her leg, Richardson had overcome runners from Britain and Germany. She glanced to her right -- and backwards -- and gave a look of \"you're not catching me,\" then took eight more steps. On the ninth one, Richardson slammed her left foot on the ground over the finish line and let out a yell.\n\nThe Americans won in 41.78 seconds, good for a .07-second win over Britain, which struggled with two baton changes in the rain.\n\n\"The moment that I would describe is realizing that when we won as USA ladies, it was a phenomenal feeling for all of us,\" Richardson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGabby Thomas ran the third leg and got her second gold of the Games, this one going with the 200-meter title. Twanisha Terry and 100 bronze medalist Melissa Jefferson rounded out the team. The exchange between Terry and Thomas that nearly wrecked the Americans in qualifying was better this time.\n\nWEIGHTLIFTING: Olivia Reeves won the United States' first Olympic gold medal in weightlifting in 24 years.\n\nReeves lifted 117 kilograms (390 pounds) in the snatch and 145kg (320 pounds) in the clean and jerk for a total of 262kg to beat Mari Leivis Sanchez of Colombia by five kilograms in the women's 71kg division. Angie Dajomes of Ecuador took the bronze.\n\nThe U.S. last won an Olympic gold medal in weightlifting in Sydney in 2000, when Tara Nott won the lightest women's division. That was the first Olympic Games to include women's weightlifting on the program.\n\nMEN'S SOCCER: Sergio Camello struck twice in extra time as Spain took gold in the Olympic men's soccer final after a 5-3 win against France.\n\nThe thrilling win at Parc des Princes completed a golden summer for Spanish soccer -- following the senior team's European Championship triumph last month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpain, which lost the final to Brazil at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, became the first European gold medalist in men's soccer since it last won the tournament at the Barcelona Games in 1992.\n\nWOMEN'S SOCCER: Ann-Katrin Berger saved a last-minute penalty and Germany won the bronze medal with a 1-0 victory over Women's World Cup winner Spain.\n\nWOMEN'S FIELD HOCKEY: The Netherlands defended its title, rallying from an early deficit to beat China 2-1 in a shootout in the final.\n\nGOLF: Lydia Ko of New Zealand had a 4-under 68 to share the lead, leaving her 18 holes away from a chance to complete her Olympic medal collection with gold that would send her into the LPGA Hall of Fame.\n\nKo was poised to take a lead into the final day at Le Golf National until Morgane Metraux of Switzerland steadied herself from a rough patch by holing a 20-foot eagle putt on the par-5 18th to salvage a 71 and catch Ko.\n\nThey were at 9-under 207, and the stage was set for yet another dynamic Olympic conclusion.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.", "source": {"uri": "centralmaine.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Richardson was assisted by USA's Melissa Jefferson (11.34s), Twanisha Terry (10:02s) and Gabby Thomas (10:59s), who ran the first three legs ahead of her winning sprint.\n\nOnce Thomas handed the baton to Richardson, she took off like a missile passing Germany's Rebekka Haase in a total time of 41.94 seconds.\n\nThe 24-year-old's feat follows her taking second place to Saint Lucia's Julien Alfred in the Women's 100-meter on Aug. 3. Richardson came in second place with a time of 10.87 -- .15 seconds behind Alfred who finished in 10.72 seconds.\n\nHours before the latter, a video surfaced on social media of Richardson and Jamaica's Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce being denied entry to the track and field facility for warmup.\n\nThe two track stars were told to use a separate entrance -- which reportedly took an hour to get to. Although the girls had entered the same gate only 24 hours before, an overnight rule was enforced that wouldn't allow them to enter that particular gate with their own personal drivers.\n\nRichardson being held up at the gate reportedly forced her to enter elsewhere, which could have caused her to exert extra energy ahead of the 100-meter.\n\nRichardson and Team USA will go for the gold in the 4\u00d7100 meter final relay on Friday (Aug. 11) at 1:30 p.m. ET on NBC.", "source": {"uri": "vibe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vibe"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amber_corrine@vibe.com", "name": "Amber Corrine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Jefferson_(athlete)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Jefferson (athlete)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Thomas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gabrielle Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twanisha_Terry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twanisha Terry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha'Carri_Richardson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sha'Carri Richardson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Alfred", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julien Alfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebekka_Haase", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebekka Haase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relay race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelly-Ann_Fraser-Pryce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Biathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Biathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Frame_Relay", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Frame Relay", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165832591-e1723139343876.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801125", "eventUri": "eng-9801125", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-11", "textStart": 194, "textEnd": 201, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 716, "textEnd": 722}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

finished with bronze after crossing in 41.97sec, just edging out host nation France.\n\nThe victory represented a redemption of sorts for Richardson, who had been heavily favoured to win the individual 100m crown earlier in the Games only to be upset by St. Lucia's Julien Alfred.\n\nIn driving rain at the Stade de France, the US had looked to be struggling to get into the medal positions after Melissa Jefferson, Twanisha Terry and 200m gold medallist Gabby Thomas combined to leave Richardson in fourth place as she collected the baton on the last leg.\n\nMore from this section USA

Petr David Josek/Associated Press\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France -- For Sha'Carri Richardson, this was a beautiful relay through the rain.\n\nThe only shame was that she couldn't stay out there to help the men's team win, too.\n\nRichardson captured her first Olympic gold medal with a come-from-behind anchor leg for the United States in the Olympic 4\u00d7100 on Friday, then stepped aside to watch the U.S. men extend their streak to 20 years without a medal at the Games.\n\nThis year's mishap happened quickly, on the first exchange, when Christian Coleman crashed into Kenny Bednarek, then actually passed him as they were awkwardly passing the baton. The U.S. was disqualified for an illegal pass.\n\nIt was a more-of-the-same result for a team that raced without 100-meter champion Noah Lyles, who pulled out of the Olympics with COVID. Even without Lyles, the speed of the Americans made it their race to lose.\n\nThey always find a way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It just didn't happen,\" Coleman said. \"Maybe we could have put in some more work. I just think in the moment it didn't happen.\"\n\nAndre De Grasse put a bright mark on an otherwise disappointing Olympics by anchoring Canada to gold in a time of 37.50 seconds. It was the first medal in Paris for De Grasse, but his seventh overall. South Africa finished second and Britain third.\n\nThe run by Richardson and her teammates was everything the men's race was not -- filled with smooth safe passes of a rain-slickened baton, then capped off by America's fastest 100-meter runner.\n\nThe silver medalist from the 100 received the baton from Thomas in third place. By the halfway point of her leg, Richardson had overcome runners from Britain and Germany. She glanced to her right -- and backwards -- and gave a look of \"you're not catching me,\" then took eight more steps. On the ninth one, Richardson slammed her left foot on the ground over the finish line and let out a yell.\n\nThe Americans won in 41.78 seconds, good for a .07-second win over Britain, which struggled with two baton changes in the rain.\n\n\"The moment that I would describe is realizing that when we won as USA ladies, it was a phenomenal feeling for all of us,\" Richardson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGabby Thomas ran the third leg and got her second gold of the Games, this one going with the 200-meter title. Twanisha Terry and 100 bronze medalist Melissa Jefferson rounded out the team. The exchange between Terry and Thomas that nearly wrecked the Americans in qualifying was better this time.\n\nAlso Friday, American sprinter Rai Benjamin convincingly beat world-record-holder Karsten Warholm and Brazil's Alison dos Santos in the 400-meter hurdles final.\n\nBenjamin clocked 46.46 seconds to win gold, finishing several strides ahead of Warholm (47.06) and Dos Santos (47.26). Benjamin was able to win despite landing awkwardly coming over the eighth hurdle in a race between the three fastest men in history.\n\nBenjamin won silver behind Warholm when the Norwegian set the world record at the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\nWEIGHTLIFTING: Olivia Reeves won the United States' first Olympic gold medal in weightlifting in 24 years.\n\nReeves lifted 117 kilograms (390 pounds) in the snatch and 145kg (320 pounds) in the clean and jerk for a total of 262kg to beat Mari Leivis Sanchez of Colombia by five kilograms in the women's 71kg division. Angie Dajomes of Ecuador took the bronze.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. last won an Olympic gold medal in weightlifting in Sydney in 2000, when Tara Nott won the lightest women's division.

Petr David Josek/Associated Press\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France -- For Sha'Carri Richardson, this was a beautiful relay through the rain.\n\nThe only shame was that she couldn't stay out there to help the men's team win, too.\n\nRichardson captured her first Olympic gold medal with a come-from-behind anchor leg for the United States in the Olympic 4\u00d7100 on Friday, then stepped aside to watch the U.S. men extend their streak to 20 years without a medal at the Games.\n\nThis year's mishap happened quickly, on the first exchange, when Christian Coleman crashed into Kenny Bednarek, then actually passed him as they were awkwardly passing the baton. The U.S. was disqualified for an illegal pass.\n\nIt was a more-of-the-same result for a team that raced without 100-meter champion Noah Lyles, who pulled out of the Olympics with COVID. Even without Lyles, the speed of the Americans made it their race to lose.\n\nThey always find a way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It just didn't happen,\" Coleman said. \"Maybe we could have put in some more work. I just think in the moment it didn't happen.\"\n\nAndre De Grasse put a bright mark on an otherwise disappointing Olympics by anchoring Canada to gold in a time of 37.50 seconds. It was the first medal in Paris for De Grasse, but his seventh overall. South Africa finished second and Britain third.\n\nThe run by Richardson and her teammates was everything the men's race was not -- filled with smooth safe passes of a rain-slickened baton, then capped off by America's fastest 100-meter runner.\n\nThe silver medalist from the 100 received the baton from Thomas in third place. By the halfway point of her leg, Richardson had overcome runners from Britain and Germany. She glanced to her right -- and backwards -- and gave a look of \"you're not catching me,\" then took eight more steps. On the ninth one, Richardson slammed her left foot on the ground over the finish line and let out a yell.\n\nThe Americans won in 41.78 seconds, good for a .07-second win over Britain, which struggled with two baton changes in the rain.\n\n\"The moment that I would describe is realizing that when we won as USA ladies, it was a phenomenal feeling for all of us,\" Richardson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGabby Thomas ran the third leg and got her second gold of the Games, this one going with the 200-meter title. Twanisha Terry and 100 bronze medalist Melissa Jefferson rounded out the team. The exchange between Terry and Thomas that nearly wrecked the Americans in qualifying was better this time.\n\nWEIGHTLIFTING: Olivia Reeves won the United States' first Olympic gold medal in weightlifting in 24 years.\n\nReeves lifted 117 kilograms (390 pounds) in the snatch and 145kg (320 pounds) in the clean and jerk for a total of 262kg to beat Mari Leivis Sanchez of Colombia by five kilograms in the women's 71kg division. Angie Dajomes of Ecuador took the bronze.\n\nThe U.S. last won an Olympic gold medal in weightlifting in Sydney in 2000, when Tara Nott won the lightest women's division. That was the first Olympic Games to include women's weightlifting on the program.\n\nMEN'S SOCCER: Sergio Camello struck twice in extra time as Spain took gold in the Olympic men's soccer final after a 5-3 win against France.\n\nThe thrilling win at Parc des Princes completed a golden summer for Spanish soccer -- following the senior team's European Championship triumph last month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpain, which lost the final to Brazil at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, became the first European gold medalist in men's soccer since it last won the tournament at the Barcelona Games in 1992.\n\nWOMEN'S SOCCER: Ann-Katrin Berger saved a last-minute penalty and Germany won the bronze medal with a 1-0 victory over Women's World Cup winner Spain.\n\nWOMEN'S FIELD HOCKEY: The Netherlands defended its title, rallying from an early deficit to beat China 2-1 in a shootout in the final.\n\nGOLF: Lydia Ko of New Zealand had a 4-under 68 to share the lead, leaving her 18 holes away from a chance to complete her Olympic medal collection with gold that would send her into the LPGA Hall of Fame.\n\nKo was poised to take a lead into the final day at Le Golf National until Morgane Metraux of Switzerland steadied herself from a rough patch by holing a 20-foot eagle putt on the par-5 18th to salvage a 71 and catch Ko.\n\nThey were at 9-under 207, and the stage was set for yet another dynamic Olympic conclusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMEN'S VOLLEYBALL: Four-time U.S. Olympians Matt Anderson and David Smith are medalists once more.\n\nThey came back for this chance.\n\nThe Americans are taking home men's volleyball hardware from the Paris Olympics, outlasting Italy in a wild, back-and-forth battle for bronze.\n\nIt went 25-23, 30-28 - a sensational second set in which each country had multiple chances - and 26-24 at a rocking South Paris Arena.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nFenway Sports

That look -- one that said, \"Fine, I'm leaving without you\" or \"Is that all you've got?\" -- was quickly minted as a meme on social media.\n\nThe win continues Team USA's dominant showing, especially in track and field, at the Paris Olympics.\n\nRichardson, Gabby Thomas, Twanisha Terry, Melissa Jefferson covered the lap around the Stade de France track in 41.78 seconds, a season-best time, even after the iffy Thomas-to-Richardson baton pass-off.\n\n\"When we won as USA ladies it was an honor for all of us,\" Richardson, who won the silver medal in the 100-meter sprint earlier in the week. \"I remember trusting my third leg, trusting Gabby, knowing she was going to put that stick in my hand no matter what, and to leave my best on the track.\"\n\nGreat Britain, came in second, and Germany third.\n\nJamaica's team, who not so long ago stood as the U.S. team's stiffest competition, came in sixth. Three of their sprint superstars either missed or dropped out of the Paris Games due to injury.\n\nIn the men's race, the U.S. -- after initially placing fifth -- was disqualified after botching their first handoff, when Christian Coleman passed to Kenny Bednarek. Fred Kerley, as anchor, and Kyree King rounded out the team.\n\nA day ago, the team learned that it would have to run without its best asset, newly-minted 100-meter champion Noah Lyles. After finishing with bronze in his best event, the 200-meter sprint on Thursday, Lyles revealed that he had COVID-19.\n\nCanada won gold, South Africa took silver and Great Britain won bronze.\n\nU.S. men, clearly angered and frustrated by their performance, spoke briefly with reporters after the race. \"We had the mindset of no risk, no reward,\" King said. \"We went out there and went big and it didn't happen.\"\n\nAsked about the apparent mistiming of a key handoff, the men said they wouldn't talk about individual missteps that might have cost them the race.\n\nThe U.S. teams are notorious for fumbling relay handoffs. At the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, a Team USA handoff disqualification in the 4x400-meter mixed-gender relay almost cost the team a medal. Ultimately, the ruling was overturned, and the team took home bronze.\n\nAt the Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016, the women's 4x100-meter relay team successfully overturned a DQ after arguing that other runners forced a baton drop.", "source": {"uri": "bpr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "bpr.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race", "type": "wiki",

Their victory was attributed to three precise handovers and a clean run, contrasting with Britain's botched final baton exchange.\n\nThe U.S. team, consisting of Melissa Jefferson, Twanisha Terry, Paris Olympic 200m champion Gabby Thomas, and Sha'Carri Richardson, clocked an impressive 41.78 seconds. This seamless execution left Britain to falter during their final handover amid heavy rain at Stade de France.\n\nAlthough Britain led through three legs, Amy Hunt's struggle to pass the baton to Daryll Neita resulted in a significant loss of momentum, giving Richardson a clear path to the finish line. Despite the setback, Britain secured silver in 41.85 seconds, and Germany took bronze in 41.97 seconds.\n\nNotably, the American squad, enriched with talent, capitalized on the absence of several top Jamaican athletes, including Elaine Thompson-Herah and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce.

night.\n\nThe Americans were in third spot when Richardson took the baton from 200m individual gold medallist Gabby Thomas but she motored home ahead of Britain and Germany.\n\n\"The moment that I would describe is realising that when we won as USA ladies, it was a phenomenal feeling for all of us,\" said Richardson.\n\nThe stacked team also included Thomas, 100m bronze medallist Melissa Jefferson and Twanisha Terry.\n\nIt was a first Olympic gold for the 24-year-old Richardson, who missed the 2020 Tokyo Games after testing positive for marijuana and being hit with a one-month ban.\n\nBut if the US women were flawless on a rare wet night at the Stade de France, the men were anything but.\n\nChristian Coleman and Kenny Bednarek completely botched the first change and after crossing the line seventh the Americans were later disqualified, extending their run without an Olympic 4x100m medal of any colour to 20 long years.\n\n\"Obviously we all are going to be hard on ourselves,\" said Coleman.\n\n\"Track and field is an individual sport so we do our own thing in sprinting.\n\n\"So when we come together as a team, that's the fun part of it.\n\n\"Obviously, it's a little disappointing, especially for America, because we wanted to do it, we wanted to bring it home, we knew we had the speed to do it.\n\n\"It just didn't happen.'\n\nThe US team were without 100m

Team Great Britain won silver, while Team Germany took bronze.\n\nWith the win, Richardson, the charismatic American track superstar, finally gets her Olympic gold. She fell short of an individual gold medal last Saturday, finishing in second place behind Julien Alfred of St. Lucia in the 100-m race. Richardson might have made the difference between silver and gold for the 4 x 100-m relay in Tokyo, but she was suspended before those Games, making worldwide news: Richardson had smoked marijuana, a banned substance under World Anti-Doping Agency rules. She said she did so to cope with the stress of losing her biological mother around the time of the U.S. Olympic trials, which Richardson won.\n\nThe relay win also gave Thomas, the Harvard-educated track and field standout, a second Olympic gold medal at these Paris Games, setting her up to be the breakout athlete for Team USA. Thomas won the 200-m wire-to-wire on Tuesday night. Thomas' mother, University of Michigan education professor Jennifer Randall, said she watched Allyson Felix run at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, where Felix won a silver in the 200-m and a gold in the 4 x 400-m relay, and phoned her daughter in Alabama, where Gabby was visiting her great-grandmother, Randall's grandmother. \"I told her, 'this is you,'\" says Randall. \"You are going to be an Olympian.' She probably just rolled her eyes.'\" Thomas, at the time, was 11.\n\nThomas didn't take to track and field until she was in high school. \"Gabby was predisposed to working hard,\" says Randall. \"And she's very competitive.\" She enjoyed setting goals, and reaching them. Thomas thought about quitting track and field while juggling academics at Harvard, and after turning pro, when she moved to Austin to join a training group. \"It was hard for her,\" says Randall. \"But if she would have quit, I know she would have regretted it.\"\n\nThomas looked up to Felix, the most decorated American track and field athlete with 20 world championships medals and 11 Olympic medals, and the pair now enjoy a friendly relationship. Thomas expects to run the 4 x 400 relay tomorrow night, and she could match Felix's haul at the London Olympics, when Felix won gold in the 200, 4 x 100 and 4 x 400 races.\n\nThe victory extends Team USA's dominant track and field performance in Paris. The Americans now own 10 golds in the sport; Canada has the second-most, with just two. Team USA has won 28 track and field medals overall. Jamaica and Australia tied for second most with 6.\n\nThe American handoffs were clean, and legs fast, in the women's 4 x 100 on Friday. The team's depth is unmatched. It's firmly back on top.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_gregory@time.com", "name": "Sean Gregory", "type": "author", "isAgency":

The American men and women both powered through their 4x100m relay heats to warn off any rivals aiming to challenge their dominance.\n\nStung by having to settle for 100m silver, Sha'Carri Richardson ran her anchor leg in an eye-popping 9.99sec to see the women home while the men could afford to leave out Lyles and still cruise to victory. Olympic 100m silver medallist Richardson and newly-crowned 200m champion Gabby Thomas steered the United States into the final of the women's 4x100m relay after winning their heat in 41.94 seconds yesterday. Melissa Jefferson, who won bronze in the 100m in Paris, ran the opening leg, with Twanisha Terry taking the baton down the far straight.\n\nTerry's handover to Thomas wasn't as smooth as it could have been, however, handing the advantage to Germany. Thomas' pass to anchor-leg Richardson was clean. The 100m silver medallist then powered past Rebekka Haase to push the German quartet into second in 42.15. Switzerland took the third automatic qualifying spot.\n\nBritain won the second semi-final in 42.03sec ahead of France and Jamaica, the reigning Olympic champions but missing big guns such as Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Shericka Jackson and Elaine Thompson-Herah. Canada and the Netherlands sealed the two fastest non-automatic qualifying places for the final scheduled on Friday.\n\n'Do it for him'\n\nEarlier yesterday, 24 women dived into the River Seine, which was deemed clean enough for competition, for the 10-kilometre swim through the heart of the city. Sharon van Rouwendaal from the Netherlands won a gruelling battle against her competitors and a strong current in 2hr 3min 34sec, devoting her gold to the memory of her pet dog, Rio, who died in May.\n\n\"Swimming is my everything, but so was he... My father said: 'swim one more time and do it for him. And that's what I did',\" she added. Water quality in the Seine has been in the spotlight during the Olympics despite a 1.4-billion-euro ($1.5-billion) effort to improve sewerage and water treatment.\n\nOrganisers have been forced to scrap several training sessions and postpone the men's triathlon after assessing the water to be too dirty to swim in.", "source": {"uri": "newsofbahrain.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DT News"},

However, any type of rainfall could result in higher levels of E. coli and bacteria in the river. During the opening ceremony, over a month's worth of rain fell into the river within 36 hours.\n\nA test run that would've let Olympians familiarize themselves with the course was canceled due to the high concern over the quality of the water, and multiple athletes became sick.

Staying with the pack was the name of the game for Hoppel, as he kicked just enough in the final stretch to finish in second place in his heat and to be an automatic qualifier with a time of 1:43.41.\n\n6:40 a.m. ET -- Team USA men's 4x400 gets the stick onto the finals\n\nQuincy Wilson, 16, wouldn't just make history as the youngest American male to compete in the Olympics, he had the honor come out of the blocks as the first leg.\n\nWilson ran a 47.27-second split, handing off the baton seventh to Vernon Norwood. His 43.54 caught Team USA up with the pack. Bryce Deadmon ran 44.20 seconds to pass off the baton to Chris Bailey, who was in the men's 400m final, to pull through for the U.S. The top three move onto finals, and Bailey's 44.14 anchor leg split moved Team USA into qualifying position to finish third with a 2:59.15 to advance to the finals.", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Days later, on Aug. 9, she helped Team USA, which includes Melissa Jefferson, Gabby Thomas, and Twanisha Terry, clinch a gold medal in the 4\u00d7100 relay.\n\nVideo of her regaining the team's No. 1 spot in a qualifying round has been heavily circulated among sports fans. Richardson took on anchor leg duties in both the qualifier and final race. The viral pre-finals footage shows her catch up to Germany's Rebekka Haase, and then switch into high gear, blowing through the finish line.\n\nThe 24-year-old sprinter is the subject of online banter not just for her speed but because of the way she gave Haase a quick glance before leaving her behind. \"She looked her like not you really thought you was faster than me,\" a TikTok user wrote when the video was shared to the popular social platform. Other comical assumptions about her thoughts in the moment included, \"Girl u thought!\" \"Girl are you walking,\" and \"Girl if you don't get on.\"\n\nAnother fan said, \"My girl is a SAVAGE!!!\" Someone also commenting on Richardon's \"turbo sport mode\" said, \"I know German girl was giving her all, then Shacarri pulls this chit.\"\n\nRichard first qualified for the Olympics in 2021, when the Games were held in Tokyo. However, her dreams were deferred when anti-doping test results revealed she had THC in her system when she qualified in the 100 meters. She was suspended from competition for a month and missed the Olympics.\n\nHer performance in Paris has not been without its hiccups, though. Ahead of running 10.87 seconds in the 100 final, she and Jamaica's Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce were prevented from entry into the Stade de France due to an overnight rule change requiring them to arrive at the venue on the team shuttle.\n\nThe mixup thwarted chances of the women properly warming up for the competition and ultimately led to Fraser-Pryce's decision to forgo the event. \"Paris wilding for not letting Sha'Carri and Shelly in that gate,\" read a criticism of the fiasco. Neither Richardson not her competitor have provided public comments about the rule change.", "source": {"uri": "atlantablackstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Atlanta Black Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "angelina_velasquez@atlantablackstar.com", "name": "Angelina Velasquez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Jefferson_(athlete)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Jefferson (athlete)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Thomas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gabrielle Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twanisha_Terry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twanisha Terry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha'Carri_Richardson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sha'Carri Richardson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_leg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anchor leg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebekka_Haase", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebekka Haase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelly-Ann_Fraser-Pryce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doping in sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pjimage-5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801125", "eventUri": "eng-9801125", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 219, "textEnd": 225}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 242, "textEnd": 248}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 225029982, "title": "Mexico&#x27;s next president most likely a woman. But in some Indigenous villages, men have all the power", "text": "PLAN DE AYALA, Mexico (AP) \u2014 At 4:30 a.m., girls and women begin to appear in the dark streets of this village of Tojolabal people in southern Mexico. They walk in silence. Some head to grind corn to make their family\u2019s tortillas. Others fetch firewood to carry home, on their backs or with the help of a donkey. The youngest hurry to finish chores before running to school. Hours later, it\u2019s still morning, and it\u2019s time to talk. A group of young women and men gathers in a classroom at the Plan de Ayala high school. They\u2019ve come to discuss gender equality and reflect on the role of women in this remote Indigenous community in Chiapas, Mexico\u2019s poorest state. Jeydi Hern\u00e1ndez, 17, wants to be a veterinarian and play basketball, though her first attempt to form a team failed: \u201cThere were 12 of us, but my friends got married, and there were only four of us left.\u201d Mada\u00ed G\u00f3mez, 18, complains she can\u2019t express opinions in her town: \u201cThey think women don\u2019t know anything.\u201d Two Indigenous women lead the workshop; dozens attend. Years ago, such an initiative wouldn\u2019t have been so well-received, they say. But change is coming - albeit slowly. Seventy years ago, Mexican women won the right to vote, and today the country is on the verge of electing its first woman president. Yet some of the Indigenous women who will vote in Sunday\u2019s national election don\u2019t have a voice in their own homes and communities. In Plan de Ayala and other corners of Mexico, women can\u2019t participate in local government. Men set priorities. Plan de Ayala\u2019s women aren\u2019t even registered residents, even though they are on voter rolls, so its 1,200 men can only guess at the true population. With no official data, it\u2019s unclear how many communities operate this way. But it\u2019s one of many contradictions for a part of the Mexican population that for centuries has been marginalized. Now, Indigenous women are pushing for change - little by little - with the younger generation often leading the charge. Of more than 23 million Indigenous people in Mexico - nearly 20% of the population - well over half live in poverty, according to 2022 government data. And women face the worst of it, with the lowest rates of literacy in their communities and little, if any, rights to own land. Neither of the two women candidates for president - Claudia Sheinbaum of the governing Morena party and the opposition\u2019s X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez \u2014 have spoken much about Indigenous issues. Still, women in this region can\u2019t hide some hope that a woman president could better address some of their most pressing needs: health care and education access, and protection from domestic violence. Juana Cruz, 51, is one of the women on a crusade to bring change. She grew up listening to stories of abuses suffered by four generations of her family forced to work on an estate where they had to speak Spanish rather than their native Tojolabal, a Mayan-family language. She remembers being beaten in school for not speaking Spanish well. Today she\u2019s one of the most veteran social activists in Las Margaritas, the municipality that includes Plan de Ayala, and director of Tzome Ixuk, which means \u201corganized woman\u201d in Tojolabal. There\u2019s been progress in places like Las Margaritas, a sprawling township of some 140,000 people spread across about 400 mostly Indigenous communities, including Plan de Ayala, but unwritten rules still govern much of life in the villages. Increasingly, girls and young women are rejecting such norms. That\u2019s part of what\u2019s discussed in the workshops at Plan de Ayala high school. About a third of those gathered said they\u2019d like to continue studying, according to Mar\u00eda Leticia Santiz, 28, and Liz V\u00e1zquez, 33, who lead the discussion. \u201cYou all have the ability to make decisions in your communities, in your schools, in your families,\u201d V\u00e1zquez tells the group. \u201cYou are a generation of change.\u201d Santiz translates to Tojolabal. V\u00e1zquez and Santiz are from a collective called Ch\u2019ieltik, meaning \u201cwe are those who grow\u201d in the Indigenous language Tseltal. The group\u2019s goal is to encourage conversation and reflection among young people in some of Chiapas\u2019 most closed communities. In Plan de Ayala, like most rural corners of Las Margaritas, there\u2019s little evidence of the coming national election. Posters of Sheinbaum are seen in some places. The face of G\u00e1lvez - who has Indigenous roots, with an Otomi father - is not. V\u00e1zquez says that personally, she hasn\u2019t connected with either candidate. But in the workshop, she tells the group that a woman becoming president proves nothing is impossible. The campaigns of the two leading female presidential candidates are notable for what\u2019s lacking: any prioritization of gender issues or detailed plans to address Indigenous communities\u2019 issues. Sheinbaum insists she\u2019ll try to reach agreements to compensate for past injustices against some Indigenous peoples. G\u00e1lvez has only gone so far as to remind voters of projects she pushed when she was in charge of Indigenous development under a previous administration, two decades ago. In Plan de Ayala, V\u00e1zquez and Santiz leave the workshop at the school encouraged. The young men seem receptive to speaking about equality, and they see signs of change: fathers supporting daughters\u2019 dreams, young women carving out spaces for themselves. After the workshop, Mada\u00ed G\u00f3mez, the 18-year-old, heads home to finish helping her mother. She\u2019s not yet sure about continuing school - she wants to be economically independent and considers herself a strong woman who doesn\u2019t take \u201cno\u201d for an answer. Maybe she\u2019ll stay here and find work. Maybe she\u2019ll try making it to the U.S. That afternoon, she puts on her soccer uniform and heads to the local field, optimistic that more girls want to join. On the dirt track, teens pass older women wearing traditional embroidered blouses and satin skirts returning from the fields, their bodies stooped by bundles of grass hoisted on their backs. G\u00f3mez said she believes in the potential of her community\u2019s women and thinks Mexico\u2019s first woman president could show they can do more even than men. \u201cI want gender equality to come, for them to give us that chance to raise our voices, for our voice to be valued the same as a man\u2019s,\u201d she said.", "summary": "At 4:30 a.m., girls and women begin to appear in the dark streets of this village of Tojolabal people in southern Mexico.

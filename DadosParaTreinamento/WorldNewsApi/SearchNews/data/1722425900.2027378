Global News visited several stores in the Vancouver area and found examples of what appeared to be mislabeled fruit. We contacted the stores for an explanation but only Save On Foods responded, saying, \u201cAfter investigating we discovered we made an error in data entry when these apples were sourced, resulting in the tag differing from the country of origin. \u201cWe sent replacement signage immediately to fix this issue and are currently reviewing all other B.C. products to ensure they are accurately represented on the shelf.\u201d Growers said it is up to consumers who value local produce to ensure they get what they are paying for. Mani Gill from the BC Fruit Growers Association said that whenever possible, ask for local produce. \u201cIt hurts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is one of the worst growing seasons ever and we have retailers advertising they are selling B.C. produce. \u201cIt seems like they don\u2019t care.\u201d Retailers are also having trouble even sourcing some fruit. A bitter cold snap in January, which saw temperatures plunge to -28 C for a couple of days, killed off nearly all Okanagan stone fruits. That\u2019s left farmers, fruit stands and B.C. markets, which are usually laden with locally grown goods, in an unfamiliar position. \u201cWe\u2019re branching into some of the places that grow peaches really well,\u201d said Jennay Oliver, owner of Paynters Market in West Kelowna. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing some fruits from the States, which is really hard for me because we only sell B.C. products.\u201d Deep Brar, the vice-president of the BC Fruit Growers Association, said he\u2019s lost 15 acres of peaches, with one exception. \u201cI saw one blossom and it\u2019s got to be the most famous blossom in the whole valley because there was only a few of them around,\u201d Brar said. In all, Brar said area orchardists have lost $500 million. \u2014 files from Doyle Potenteau", "summary": "B.C.'s tree fruit industry is warning B.C. consumers that some of the products on grocery store shelves, labelled as 'Grown in B.C.', could actually be from somewhere else.", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10595048/mislabeled-fruit-concerns-grown-in-bc/", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/US-apple-at-Vancouver-SaveOn-2.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:08:30", "author": "Aaron McArthur,Amy Judd", "authors": ["Aaron McArthur", "Amy Judd"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.405}
